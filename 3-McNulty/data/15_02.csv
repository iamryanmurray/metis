"Bogus. 

Yes, the city is having severe growing pains. And yeah, most of them are in Capitol Hill, but blaming everything on Amazon and Microsoft is childish at best. It gets even worse when you don't blame the companies, but instead take out your anger on the employees, many of whom just moved here hearing about how cool/chilld the Northwest was. 

I moved here years ago, and you want to know what I remember? A backwater town that barely had an economy going for it. Even then everyone bitched relentlessly about how us foreigners moving in was ""ruining"" the small town vibe. Then by the time I settled in and an economy started forming, it was bitching about the 20 something college demographic and how they were ""ruining"" the small town vibe. Now it's Amazon and Microsoft, and all we can do is pine for an era few of us actually remember, using Capitol Hill as some sort of dumb ""hill to die on."".

There are plenty of places in this city that still offer cheap rent. Magnolia has $600-$1100 for one bedrooms. Belltown has $700-$1200 for one bedrooms. West Seattle and Ballard range from $800-$1100 for one bedrooms. And thats if you are such a shutin you can't stand human interaction. If you can, you can easily find stuff in the $500-$1000 range for a two bedroom with a roommate, which is easier then ever through Meetup/Craigslist. 

I'm sorry your neighborhood died. But hey guess what. It'll move. The city is growing, and those things are in high demand. Maybe not in Capitol Hill, but in Fremont, in Ballard, in West Seattle. The ""hip"" areas may move around, but they'll always exist. Slashing peoples tires, putting up threats on walls, and vadalizing houses isn't going to bring Capitol Hill back. It's just going to make the people of Capitol Hill look like petty assholes to the rest of us. ""You deserve this for bringing it up online""?. That sounds like something you'd say back in High School. 

You want to fix Seattle, actually help it grow. Help us get a functioning Lightrail in this city. Actually vote for Bus Initiatives. Vote in a fucking Subway system for once. Maybe then places like West Seattle, Magnolia, or Northgate won't be considered unliveable wastelands for being more then 10 minutes from Downtown, and living further out will actually be a solution for people who need to be Downtown constantly. Because you aren't going to scare away Amazon and Google by threatening their employees and pounding your chest, all you are going to do is make them hate you more.

"Hello there.

I removed your post, and /u/derrickito is right; your post violated the rules.

Here's a couple of ideas for you:

1. [Read the FAQ on what constitutes spam](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq#wiki_what_constitutes_spam.3F).  Surprise!  Your post is considered spam.

2. Now read [the Guidelines for Self-Promotion](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion).

3. Read the rules posted on the sidebar before posting.  Here's the relevant one (#6):

&gt; We're a community, not a bulletin board or marketplace. You may not use us to increase the popularity, profit, or market presence of a personal project. [Advertising info for /r/Seattle](http://www.reddit.com/ad_inq/).

What does this mean?  It means your post linking to your YouTube page that was asking for people to follow your channel is spam.  I didn't tell you about bouncing your post because I figured you knew and were trying to get views regardless.  Since it appears you didn't know what you were doing was wrong, let me help you.

There's a workaround you can use; if you can find a reputable blog or news site that has an article about your videos, you're welcome to post a link to that article.

Otherwise; advertising on /r/Seattle costs $5 per day and is as simple as creating a post.  [Given the amount of traffic this site receives](http://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/about/traffic/), it is an extraordinarily good deal.

"After having gone through a similar but far worse problem with a neighbor, I wouldn't be talking to the media either.  In the middle of it all, I received and invitation to go on Judge Mathis.  After several months of being stalked and harassed to the point of exhaustion I just wanted it all to go away.  

The initial problem that lead to the retaliation was a noise complaint.  The noise wasn't legal, but getting that enforced by police was impossible.  I looked into how much it would cost to sound proof the house.  Taking into consideration that having windows open during the spring and summer wasn't an option - the total bill for sound proofing and air conditioning - just to avoid the neighbor's noise - was well into the $30K range.  That's a lot of money to pay just because your neighbor is an inconsiderate lunatic.  

Faced with that, I can see why the neighbor would sue.  Now in my case, once I complained, the neighbor in question started stalking me.  What I later found out - and why it became an issue - is because he had a history of domestic violence, child abuse, assault, harassment and other antisocial behavior that tended to get out of control when he was using meth.  

After that experience, sue first ask questions later is probably the safer route to go from the start.

I get the need to shut down stores and counters in the US South in the 1950s and 1960s.  This isn't that.  You folks are misguided.  You are damaging your cause.  There are opportunities for public engagement like never before, and in few other city governments.  Moreover, you are marginalizing your movement.  Just fucking stop, because you're screwing things up for the rest of us who are actually getting shit done in an adult manner.  

Engage like adults.  Be strong, be forceful, be direct and be honest.  But understand that when you shut down meetings, you do not win.  Understand that when you break windows, you do not win.  You may well get on the news, but popular opinion turns against you.  Instead, show up at public events and talk to people.  Pass out literature.  You are on the right side of justice.  Talk to people about income inequality and unreasonable rent and low wage and all of that.  It's all true.  You have a winning message.  Stop turning people that would be your allies against you because you act like assholes.

"Interesting idea and it would improve bus and traffic flow through the city.

How much engineering has been done on this?  How much room is there where the the WSTT tunnel, the bus tunnel, and the Great Northern tunnel all come together at the south end?  

How deep will the new tunnel have to be to cross under the bus tunnel as it jogs from Fourth to Second?  How deep does that put the station near Pike Place Market?

Is there room for it to go down Second?  It would probably have to run deeper than the 99 tunnel since there's a point at 2nd and Lenora where the 99 tunnel passes about 40 feet under a main sewer line.  At that point the top of the 99 tunnel is 200 feet beneath the surface.  Maybe it could be a cut and cover tunnel on 2nd, but you'd have a steep slope in the tunnel to come from being deep enough to cross under the existing tunnel and then be just under the surface in a few blocks.

The Battery Street tunnel exit as shown in this isn't going to happen. The city is reconnecting the street grid and bringing Aurora up to the level of Denny at that intersection.  The engineering and plans have already been on the books for that for about 10 years.  The Battery Street tunnel is going to be gone in about two years.

There's an interesting video that shows what is under the streets along the Waterfront tunnel at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWfwnkEbc4Q

"I see no reason to doubt the DOJ’s findings that the SPD resorts to force too often and too quickly. 

As to what to do about it, it largely depends on what society wants from a police force. Are they there to enforce the law or to generate compliance with the law? How are those two things the same and how are they different? In my current work I often tell clients that “I can’t give you what you want, I can only give you what you ask for.” Let’s make sure that as a society we are asking for the right things. 

We also have to stop thinking of policing and law enforcement as something somebody else does. The pervasive attitude of folks not wanting to get involved, or thinking that the safety or security of society is somebody else’s job needs to stop. Be a snitch, be a rat. Pick up other peoples garbage. Call people out for littering. Tell the store owner that you just saw someone stuff those sweet Beats by Dre headphones down their pants. If you are a cop, turn in the cop that beat up the guy for mouthing off. The punishment for silence should equal the punishment for the crime.

One change that I would make is a rotation out of patrol and into a community service position for every officer. Patrol kills any spark of empathy that may reside in a new officer’s head. It’s important that officers are put in a position to actually help people instead of taking call after call of fights, thefts, drunks, and assholes. If an officer is never able to hear a “thank you” or to know that they made someone’s life better, they will never think it’s possible that maybe you aren’t an asshole.

The parts of town that were strange as fuck and full of artists are now *brogrammers doing shots*.   
That sucks.  Some of the best places for local shows etc have closed down, and been replaced with either high end bars or something of the sort.

That subculture still exists in Seattle, it's just spread to the edges of the city instead of being in the center. It's now in Columbia City, Rainier beach, Ballard, and West Seattle.  Pike/Pine was awesome when I moved here. In the last 6 years there is a *marked change in the people who hang there* from hip tattoo'd artist types, to dude bros in collared shirts.

This is because of a provision in the U.S. tax code, known as ""280E,"" which prohibits businesses from claiming any tax deductions if they are trafficking drugs the federal government considers illegal.

"I have a feeling I'm gonna get slammed for this but here goes... This lawsuit sounds like bullshit and I don't think this should even remotely be considered as a piece in a pattern of misconduct.

&gt;Davila-Marquez accused Flanagan of restraining her and pressing her against the hood of a police cruiser, which was “hot enough to burn human skin,” according to the lawsuit.

Have you ever felt the hood of running car? It doesn't burn your skin. It hardly feels warm. How about a car that has been running for hours in the sun on a 90+ degree day? It's pretty hot, but most likely not enough to result in any visible damage beyond some redness, let alone legitimate injury.

http://www.keprtv.com/news/local/151202255.html
She makes the claim 3 years later that she suffered 2nd degree burns and has facial scarring still. A 2nd degree burn is blisters to put it simply. Do you realize how hot the hood of that car would have to be? Especially to cause so much damage to the skin you are basically scarred for the rest of your life?

Finally, I'm not anything of an expert on this, but 100 grand sounds awfully cheap for such a clear cut case against the city.

&gt;The woman who originally called police came to where Davila-Marquez was detained and told the officers they had the wrong person, the release said.

This is someone who called them, and obviously saw enough to be credible in a legitimate brutality suit. This seems like a million dollar case to me, but they settle for 100k?
http://tamakilaw.com/2013/06/24/woman-reaches-100000-settlement-in-lawsuit-against-pasco-police-department/

"Ok. Fuck these assholes. 

I've lived in the greater Seattle area all of my life and I seriously cannot believe how out of touch and entitled these Capitol Hill assholes seem to be. The passive aggressive graffiti and flyers attacking the personalities of stereotypical tech employees are one thing, actual vandalism of their property is another. If it were some underprivileged minority who was being harassed, I'm sure it would be **not ok** to do so. But since they're assumed to be straight, white, cis, rich, males I suppose it's ok to harass them a bit right? 

How did these vandals know this person wasn't a woman who just entered the technology industry? A woman who's harassed at work for being a woman in tech is then harassed at home for being in tech? Frankly it's disgusting. 

From the perspective of anyone living outside the city of Seattle. Living on Capitol Hill has always been **expensive** and affordable to only a **privileged** few for many many years. To us poor yokels living outside the City, **any** Seattle neighborhood is prohibitively expensive to live in. From our perspective this entire issue looks like a bunch of privileged white people upset that another group of slightly more privileged white people are ""gentrifying"" their already expensive, overpriced, and overrated Hipster neighborhood as they move out of Capitol Hill kicking and screaming into areas that they themselves are now gentrifying without the slightest bit of self awareness. 

If you drive a few miles south into south Seattle you can see where the real gentrification is happening. You know the classic advance of privileged white people displacing poor, underprivileged black people from their neighborhoods. You don't see organized campaigns of passive aggressive posters, internet whiners, and vandals even though they're the true victims here. Ironically, while looking for a new house I've heard lots of warning tales from hip Seattlities about how crummy areas like South Seattle, West Seattle, White Center and South Park are... but after having been around these neighborhoods myself I've come to realize that what these hipsters are really saying about these areas is that they are not ""white enough"" for them. In reality these neighborhoods are no worse than the majority of areas outside the city in places like Everett, Kirkland, and Lynwoood. In fact these areas are on average, better looking than the average areas of the cities I've mentioned here. Let alone places like Spokane, Kelso, and Tacoma who they themselves are not at all ""bad places"" to live on the national stage.

Dear upset Capitol Hill Residents, 

You're **not entitled** to a hip mostly-white unchanging neighborhood full of posh coffee shops that serve organic GMO-free luxury espressos in the middle of one of the fastest growing cities in the nation. You currently live in the most popular neighborhood, in one of the best cities, in one of the best states in the entire United States.

"My issue is that Boeing wants to have it both ways. 

Boeing had no problem lobbying for the tax breaks by touting the jobs they would create. So if they're fine with that as the justification, they should be fine with using that as a measure of the tax break's effectiveness. 

It's also worth noting that South Carolina, Missouri and Alabama all have job targets associated with their Boeing tax breaks (which are smaller than WA's tax breaks).

The potential problem I see with using project based guarantees is that there are still a lot of other projects and staffing that could be shut down or shipped out. The biggest benefit of a new project is the jobs it creates, so it makes sense to me that jobs should be the main benchmark.

"&gt; The main reason is increasingly expensive real estate, especially for the space it leases around the city to house its merchandise.

Unchecked surges in rental prices aren't just bad for individuals - it is bad for small businesses and entrepreneurs - as evidenced with Cascade Design's decision. 

&gt; But labor costs — recently subject to a minimum wage of $15 per hour — also add up

Either poor wording or poor fact-checking. Seattle won't have $15 min wage at the earliest for two [years](http://www.littler.com/publication-press/publication/seattle-increases-minimum-wage-15-hour-over-several-years):
&gt; The Seattle minimum wage is initially $11.00 per hour, effective April 1, 2015, followed by incremental increases according to the timelines set forth below.  Schedule 1 Employers have two and a half years to reach a minimum wage of $15.00.  Those that provide qualifying medical benefits will have an additional year. Schedule 2 Employers have four and a half years to reach $15.00 per hour.  Those that can claim a sufficient credit for tips and/or qualifying employer-paid medical benefits have an additional two years, and also benefit from a lower initial effective minimum wage rate of $10.00 per hour. 

It looks like Cascade Designs is a ""Schedule 1"" employer - if they don't pay towards employee medical benefits, they have until 2017 for the $15 wage. If they *do* pay towards medical benefits, they have until 2018.

For example, I have a brilliant friend who was working as an analyst who was a critical person in a department making roughly $78k a year. Then they pretty much were asked to train their job away to people in India since it was much cheaper, and then laid off.

That department after hearing through the grapevine from my friend is just super frustrated because the people in India have no problem solving skills, act like robots and cannot deviate from what they've been taught, and that it actually slows down business quite a bit.

"Thank you for your reply.

I have concerns about your response.

The [Performance Mentoring Program/Early Intervention System](http://www.seattle.gov/police-manual/title-3---employee-welfare/3070---performance-mentoring-program) you reference was enacted about a year ago, [in March 2014](http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/spl/documents/spd_docket123.pdf), before the OPA complaint about Whitlach's facebook posts and before her golf-club arrest that the department later apologized for.  

**Why did this Early Intervention System fail to work in these instances? Why should we have confidence that it will work in other instances?**

The document detailing the [Business Intelligence System](http://www.seattle.gov/police/compliance/docs/BI_Reports/SPD_BI_ExecSummary_FINAL.pdf) you say will close existing gaps is dated December 2013 and appears to be a required component of the Settlement Agreement and Memorandum of Understanding with the Department of Justice. 

This proposal says that ""six months is estimated to be able to achieve the recommendation and establishment of foundational processes"" for the detailed project and includes ""the building of the complete solution from Functional Specifications to Rollout.""

**Was this process fully funded and completed last year? If not, how much of this project has been completed to date, what is the target completion date, and why was it not completed earlier?**

I look forward to your response and I'm still looking forward to /u/mayoredmurray response since he is ultimately accountable for what happens and he's currently negotiating the police union contract.

"I know I'm late to the party, but here's the thing that pisses me off about this.  I grew up in poverty, jail or drugs no future type shit. I decided that isn't the life I wanted so I changed it.  

I worked my way through school, living in the worst parts of town because that is what I could afford.  I took low paying entry level jobs in the industry so I could gain experience in the real world.  During the recession, things got tight, I lost my job and had a period of homelessness. That didn't stop me from continually looking for work in my field. I kept going, kept fighting and most importantly kept working on myself and my skills.

Now, after almost 15 years of hard work I have built a great career and reputation. I can afford to live anywhere I want and I don't bitch about growth or change.  

No one owes you anything. You don't ""deserve"" to live anywhere you want just because you say so. That is not how the world works and I'm sorry but as a non-native Seattlite who has seen real desperation in people, this whole thing reeks of entitlement and privilege.

Let the official people grow it. Don't tax the growers heavily (for now) and do a 25-50% tax on the finished product. Mandatory testing on everything for quality.

Let people grow up to 8 plants at home (with landlord permission only and a standard, easy to get permit. )

The ""grown ups"" of Olympia need to stop acting like this is crack cocaine. Marijuana is a part of our culture and our heritage at this point and it doesn't kill anyone.

It really doesn't. Stupid inexperienced drivers cause wrecks. Otherwise half of Seattle would be in wrecks daily.

"&gt; Proof. I want real, scientifically-valid proof.

Well, here's a [sourced article](http://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/green-science/paper-plastic1.htm) that I found with a quick search.  The article covers the issues with both paper and plastic.

**Causes pollution**: Paper production emits air pollution, specifically 70 percent more pollution than the production of plastic bags [source: Thompson]. According to certain studies, manufacturing paper emits 80 percent more greenhouse gases [source: Lilienfield]. And, consider that making paper uses trees that, instead, could be absorbing carbon dioxide. The paper bag making process also results in 50 times more water pollutants than making plastic bags [source: Thompson].

**Consumes energy**: Even though petroleum goes into making plastic, it turns out that making a paper bag consumes four times as much energy as making a plastic bag, meaning making paper consumes a good deal of fuel [source: reusablebags.com].

**Consumes water**: The production of paper bags uses three times the amount of water it takes to make plastic bags [source: Lilienfield].

**Inefficient recycling**: The process of recycling paper can be inefficient -- often consuming more fuel than it would take to make a new bag [source: Milstein]. In addition, it takes about 91 percent more energy to recycle a pound of paper than a pound of plastic [source: reusablebags.com].
    
**Produces waste**: According to some measures, paper bags generate 80 percent more solid waste [source: Lilienfield].
    
**Biodegrading difficulties**: Surprisingly, the EPA has stated that in landfills, paper doesn't degrade all that much faster than plastics [source: Lilienfield].

"Renting can be good for a few reasons.  Maintenance is on the landlord usually, you have flexibility to move whenever, you can capitalize on a housing market crash if you're looking to buy, it's generally cheaper, and overall you have less responsibility.  

It's not so good because you're not gaining equity (equity can be useful even if you don't think of your house as an investment), you have less freedom to do what you want with the property (including having pets), and there's some instability to go along with that freedom to move (like your landlord can force you to move, raise the rent, etc.).  

It's not a black/white good/bad in either case.  Some days I long for the time when I didn't have to worry about the moss on the roof or mowing the lawn, but I guess if we ever pay off the house it'll be worth a lot to my kids when it gets torn down and replaced by condos.

"I don't think it's about trying to tax those who use it slightly more than those who don't. It's that they are trying to fund the bridge almost exclusively through tolls. While taxing those who use it seems fair at first glance, it falls apart when you start to consider other factors. What if I were to say that the only people who should pay taxes that cover police payroll are those who call 911? That wouldn't make a whole lot of sense. 

The reality is that everyone benefits from a new bridge, even those who don't drive. Do you take the bus? This will help reduce travel times for buses and make them less likely to be late. The new light-rail will also help with that.  Do you drive through Seattle or Bellevue on a semi-regular basis, even if you don't take the bridge? Then you will benefit because the bridge will reduce traffic in many areas. Do you work for a business that associates with businesses in Seattle? Then your income benefits from transit into and out of Seattle. Do you own a house in Seattle, Bellevue, or the surrounding areas? The property value of your house is dependent on the quality of those neighborhoods. Improved traffic will help local businesses do better. Local businesses doing better will make the area more wealthy. The area being more wealthy makes property values go up. We can even find reasons for eastern Washington citizens to pitch in. First of all there's a huge amount of agriculture businesses and a lot of their products move through the city of Seattle's ports. Secondly, King County generates most of the taxes for the state, while spending less than it generates. That means a good amount of eastern Washington is subsidized by taxes generated in king county. Oddly enough the people who will benefit the least from it are the low income workers who have to commute into Seattle. They should be able to apply for an exemption. I think it's unreasonable to tax the person who has to commute to Seattle to work the job that pays less than 30k a year.

Think about this. How often have you heard someone turn down an invitation to Seattle because they didn't want to deal with traffic? Think of if that suddenly were far less an issue. The owner of BellSquare mall is lobbying against the light rail intensely because he's afraid of having to compete with Seattle businesses. I know a ton of people who never shop in Bellevue but would love to go to Seattle more if it weren't for the traffic.

"The Light Rail really only goes from the airport to downtown at this point.  It doesn't really pass near any of the bigger parks.

Probably the closest interesting parks to downtown/ the Light Rail are the Olympic Sculpture Park and Myrtle Edwards park which are right next to each other north of downtown along the waterfront.  

If you really want to see some of the bigger parks, they tend to be away from downtown.  You'll need to take a taxi/uber or ride the Metro bus system.

"This describes the Seattle freeze perfectly.

As an east coast transplant, friends are people you call up with no plan and say ""wanna do something"" and it doesn't matter, it happens, and it works.  Friends are the people who when you don't want to have a high maintenance activity, just chilling out and watching tv or playing video games, it's cool.  No expectation.  Just chill and enjoy company. 

It's very low maintenance.  Those same friends are equally cool with no plan as they are with scheduling something in advance -- a superbowl party, concert, bar outing, etc -- just that they're also available when there is no plan and that seems to be the challenge.  

When I try to engage folks out here, it always feels that there has to be a schedule, a set activity, and a cut off time.  It feels like setting up a work meeting.  And that's nice and works for some things, but it feels detached and isolated.  I never feel like I really connect with people, or that they have an interest in my life beyond my ability to contribute to activities we do in common.  

Seattle friends are more activity partners than what I would consider a friend as a transplant.  

It's a matter of perspective.  Takes time adjusting to the change.

I'm on my fourth year now, with one close Seattle-native friend.  My other close friends are recent transplants from the same relative area as me (Louisville KY / surrounding).

"From the previous thread's comment section on this article: 


I think most dissenters are missing the point of lane splitting; it's not some adrenaline fueled thing that is done recklessly, or a way to ""cut in line"", but has many advantages for both biker and the motorists in cars.

* First; biker safety. The studies have been linked time and time again here, and personal anecdotes shared, so I won't get into it again. Bottom line; it's MUCH safer to filter/split in heavy traffic situations for motorcyclists.

* Second; congestion. Filtering/splitting allows for the maximum use of the paved surface area of the road; it's much more efficient especially in crowded urban areas where traffic and congestion are mostly an issue. Filtering essentially removes motorcycles and their people from the road as far as cars are concerned. There aren't motorcycles taking up space that a car could be taking up. This directly translates into less traffic, and EVERYONE, both driver and biker alike, getting to their destination faster. This effect has been studied many times, but this [Belgian Traffic Study](http://www.tmleuven.com/project/motorcyclesandcommuting/20110921_Motorfietsen_eindrapport_Eng.pdf) does the best and most thorough job of explaining it. You can't bitch about bad traffic and then fight against laws meant to ease said traffic.

* Third; emissions. Motorcycles put out much less harmful emissions into the air than cars do; this is easily agreed upon. Combine this though with #2 above and everyone, cars and bikes, are spending less time on the road burning fuel. In a region as ""green"" as Washington likes to tout, this is a no-brainer.

* Fourth; incentive! Want to get to where you're going faster and not sit in traffic? Ride a motorcycle: traffic is for cars! While maybe not a direct incentive to make the switch, lane filtering/splitting will perhaps show more people that motorcycling is an efficient and fast (not to mention cheap!) mode of transportation around town, especially in urban environments. With more bikes on the road, the traffic will definitely improve (see linked study above for more discussion on this). Did I mention it's cheaper? Quicker? More fun?


Yes, there will be some adjustment for drivers if this bill is passed, but really it's not hard. You get used to driving in other countries where filtering/splitting is the norm in a matter of days. Fighting against it with the ""Now I need to look out for bikes!"" argument is fallacy and scary. As a motorist, you are already responsible for being aware of your surroundings and operating a vehicle in a safe manner. You should already be looking in your mirrors (twice!) before changing lanes. Bikes are pretty easy to spot; bright headlight that's always on and a bunch of reflective bits all over it. If you can't pay attention enough to do that and see us, please refrain from operating a vehicle for the safety of us all; biker and driver alike.

We here in the US associate riding a motorcycle as a hobby, unlike the rest of the world which treat it more as a means of affordable transportation. If you travel just about any place outside of North America, you have seen this. Our laws and attitudes towards bikers definitely reflect our view of bikes as a hobby. In this increasingly resource starved world, we need to change that attitude. This is a good step.

"&gt; Thank you for writing a bot that puts all events not in articles into a junk drawer post at the top of the page, that apparently people aren't happy with, or based on the looks of the traffic, read.

What do you base these claims upon?  Because it's looking a lot like you just pulled that out of a dark place a proctologist can show you with a flashlight, and I don't see anything to back up your claims.

By the way - if you'd like to have a discussion, I'm all for it.  But name-calling - e.g., ""Lazy"", ""junk drawer"", and the like - that kind of just plain shitty behavior will make people just stop listening to you.

I'm all for debate and discussion, but let's keep it civil, okay?

&gt; Because you seem really burned out and cynical. Your constantly defending your actions, and people, really, really seem to have hard grudges, against you. Like foaming at the mouth.

Being burned out would be not responding at all.  I'm not foaming at the mouth, I'm disagreeing with you, there's a difference.  Let's keep the personal attacks to a minimum here; I'm happy to talk with you, but it needs to be civil.

&gt; I haven't called you hitler once.

No, but your name-calling and such are certainly not civil.  I am not calling you names or attacking you personally, and I'll ask that you cease doing that to me.  Fair?

&gt; The shutdown of a talk at town hall a while back seemed like weak sauce.

What was the talk / post about?  I'm happy to discuss a specific removal.

&gt; Heres a suggestion, events can only be listed in a broader post by venue. The stranger calendar you posted has 200 events, but only a couple dozen venues. You could verify owners/bookers.

So we auto-create a post for each venue every week, right?  Then when we find that joe_user has posted about an event outside of the venue-post, then we remove the post and point the user to the venue-post, right?  Right now, without thinking hard, I am sure I can name over fifty event venues in Seattle.

I think this would be a hot mess, and I don't think you've thought it through at all.  Besides, when people want to know what's going on, they don't want to read fifty different posts, one for each venue, they want to know what's happening in the near future; thus, the Weekly What's Happening post.

Here's a question you didn't address at all:

&gt; How many locality-based subs permit any event listing posts? Go on, do the research, and start with the top ones in terms of subscribers. /r/nyc and /r/chicago are the two that have more subscribers than /r/Seattle. Do you see, ""Hey, go see this charity show tonight!"" posts in either of those subs? You do not, and for a good reason.

I look forward to your response to this question.",false,false,t1_cokoi15,careless,North Capitol Hill,0,1423863059,t5_2qhad,t3_2vrygl,t1_coknujg,-28,1424573797,0,0,cokoi15,Seattle,-28,,flair

"For more about Force Escalation, Police Mission Creep and the 'Us versus them' attitude cops have towards civilians, Author Radley Balko wrote this for the Cato Institute: 
&gt; ""The election of
Ronald Reagan
brought new funding,
equipment, and
a more active drugpolicing
role for the
paramilitary SWAT
units popping up
across the country.
Reagan’s new offensive
in the war on
drugs involved a more confrontational
and militaristic approach to
combating narcotics, a policy enthusiastically
embraced by Congress.
Over the next decade, with prodding
from the White House, Congress
paved the way to widespread military-style
policing by carving out exceptions
to the Posse Comitatus Act.
In 1986, for instance, Reagan declared
drugs a threat to U.S. national
security. A few years later, Congress
ordered the National Guard to
help with state drug-enforcement
efforts. By 1989, President Bush had
created a series of regional task
forces within the Department of
Defense, which brought together
police officers and soldiers for drug
interdiction. And just five years
later, Congress created a “reutilization
program” to hand military weaponry over to civilian police
agencies.
These changes, of course, were a
significant departure from longstanding
domestic policy. Yet most
were passed without much attention
from the media or the public. Any debate
was muted by assurances from
politicians that the
threat of drugs was
too pervasive to be
fought with traditional
policing. Critics
who feared for
the impact on civil
liberties were dismissed
as alarmist.

"The only adjacent street I prefer is 12th and it serves a different purpose. The reason I don't take the Broadway cycle track more often is that the destinations is serves aren't my every day services. If I'm down there I'm usually in north Broadway (where the cycle track isn't) or Pike and Pine. I don't need to go up to First Hill or Yesler Trerace very often. Central CC is kind of a dead zone too. Once the light rail station opens and the Broadway cycle track extends to the northern part of the hill it will be used more.

We shouldn't be comparing it's success to other routes, but to the number of cyclists on that section of Broadway before and after installation. You can argue it wasn't a high priority route to begin with and therefore a mid-allocation of funds that could have gone to another cycle track. But it was created with mitigation funds from ST because of the streetcar. We wouldn't get those funds for any  other reason.

And it is certainly needed for safety next to the streetcar tracks. Too many people have bit the dust on Westlake and the missing link for the city to ignore the issue tracks create for cyclists. And I support the narrowing of the road that it causes when I'm crossing Broadway on foot. The cycle track creates a de facto pedestrian refuge. Cycle tracks have in fact been proven to increase safety across the board for pedestrians as well as drivers.

"As has been said, she needed to show up. This is regardless of the perceived ""fairness"" of the finding. There really is no excuse for not showing up, other than ignorance of the law. When she was served, the complaint clearly states that she *MUST* respond to the matter or risk default judgement.

As to the facts of the case, the video does a terrible job addressing them. How does the dog behave when she is not there? Does she let the dog out at night? Is there a history of noise complaints? Police reports? No evidence was presented, just her statements and some b-roll of a quiet dog. The news video is merely there to appeal to the emotions of viewers, not present facts in an impartial manner. This is why we have courts.

Having lived near an irresponsible dog owner, I am empathetic towards the complainant. However, there are clearly better remedies available. It is likely that the complainant sued for that amount knowing that it would be reduced, result in a settlement or some other remedy. It is merely luck that he got a default judgement.

I do hope she is able to keep her home.

"This was sent to all season pass holders on Sunday 2/8:

&gt; Dear Summit Season Passholder,
&gt; 
&gt; No question the 14-15 season has had many challenges and has been quite a disappointment so far. Although we do have a substantial amount of winter left, and are certainly hopeful some late February and March powder days are in our future, at this point we do anticipate falling well short of what we consider a normal year. We want to reassure our many loyal passholders we will be very fair in examining the whole season when it is over and issuing appropriate credits to use for next year. We stand committed to our most loyal guests, our passholders, and certainly want to see each and every one of you back next season enjoying what is bound to be an epic year! We expect to make the determination for credits in early to mid April. We appreciate everyone’s patience in the meantime but trust you understand the need to get through winter first. Between now and then, let’s all hope winter does decide to return to the PNW and we can at least enjoy a handful of good skiing days. Our team at The Summit feels the pain right along with you, as we are all avid skiers and snowboarders as well!
&gt; 
&gt; Decisions or announcements regarding Nordic Season Passes and Nordic Lesson programs will be made no later than mid-March.
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you for being patient. Remember, Summit passholders have the option to ski and ride Boyne Resorts for free the remainder of the season! Plus, passholders can ski Crystal Mountain through February 13th, 2015. Click here for details.

"/u/leftcoastmoderate hit the nail on the head.

There's something to add to that. Those in political power are *always* the homeowners. Their core economic incentive is to prevent growth, as that leads to a rise in their property values. Some of them always push for restrictions to do that, so we have no examples of any regional economy meaningfully unrestricting growth. Even Houston, which technically has no zoning laws, has lots of restrictions that cause similar outcomes.

However, you can't bring rents down numerically in the short term regardless. There's no tool available to do that without causing second order effects that drive rent way up later (like we're seeing with rent control in SF and NYC). What unrestricting growth would do is open a release valve, where all the people currently pushed out to the suburbs by price would slowly be able to move in as we grew faster, and an equilibrium would be sought that's lower than the one the market is seeking today.

In the meantime, rents would rise more slowly, and you'd also see less demand for sprawl. Possibly even negative demand for sprawl, as we know we're pushing a lot of people out that would prefer to be in. That's why prices are higher in the city; it's the truest measure of preference we have. This lessening of sprawl would also be good for traffic and for environmental and health outcomes.

Once we reached that equilibrium, then you'd see rents stay largely stable, and in some places go down as buildings age (Jane Jacobs has an entire chapter on this in The Death and Life of Great American Cities). The reason Seattle had cheap rents over the last couple of decades was exactly that - supply was keeping up with demand, so older buildings aged and got cheaper. Now demand has spiked, but we've put all these restrictions on supply, so we're pushing that price equilibrium higher. Demand was actually artificially low in the city for a long time because we were so heavily subsidizing sprawl!

We'll have to allow largely unrestricted growth again to have this happen. We restrict outward growth for good reason, so that needs to be made up with using upward growth. That means not just in the existing centers, too - we need to let places like Greenlake, Roosevelt, and Ballard get tall like downtown - or we just keep supply below demand and the lowest income people get shuffled out. Ideally, we shouldn't restrict growth anywhere in the city, so that centers grow where people actually want them, rather than just where the older homeowners who show up to the planning meetings say they should go.

There's one other thing - because of our restrictions, we're dramatically reducing the risk in property investment:

* Our restrictions mostly stop developers from overbuilding. Investors that would be interested in more risk would be attracted to our market, and we *would* see developers make mistakes more often by building too much and having to drop prices to rent/sell. This could bring rents down more quickly than the overall equilibrium.

* That low risk means the average rate of return is higher today, so we might see growth slow a little if we allowed more to be built. I think that would largely balance out; an individual land owner doesn't think about the entire market, they don't make money from the whole market. They make money from their property, so they want to build as much as possible.

* Our current low risk and consequentially high rate of return attracts external investment in our property. That means people are parking cash in our real estate because they know it rises. This acts as additional demand we've induced, and this would likely disappear if we unrestricted growth: that investment wouldn't have a good return vs other potential investments. That means we'd have fewer apartments and condos lying empty with random foreign investors, and that does mean more real people served per building built.

I owned it as a kid, and I would become *furious* with the game, to the point where I'd end up with crying fits, I was so frustrated. My mom would ask ""Why do you even play it if it isn't fun?"" I never beat it.

Well, it ended up being re-released on the Xbox 360, and I thought ""Now is my chance! I'm older now, I'm a better gamer, it couldn't have been that hard.""

I load it up, I start playing it. So far so good, first few levels are simple. Oh, swim slowly past Eight Arms, how I remember you. Haha, I'm doing it. You just need a light touch, and some patience! I'd finally accomplish this!

What quickly became apparent was that young me knew *exactly* what he was doing, and this game is fucking *BULLSHIT*. Every level gets harder, you soon start dying in just a few hits, and you're constantly rushing for oxygen. I played levels over and over and over, getting to the point of wanting to scream, especially with how long some of them were. But I kept moving! I was doing it.

And then...Welcome to the Machine.

I want to paint a picture for you. The final level of Ecco the Dolphin has you flying up into an alien spacecraft (As it turns out, the story of Ecco the Dolphins is fucking *weird*), to defeat them and save your species. You have to make it through a long tube that constantly throws enemies at you, which you must dodge and get by. This is The Tube, the beginning of some of the greatest feelings of frustrating, self doubt, and hopelessness I've ever felt.

First, survive [The Tube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSO6LuDAl8I).

Upon surviving The Tube, you are now into the Vortex ship, in the single greatest experience of bullshit I've ever seen.

[Welcome to the Machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7uqcCbFQck) is a 6 minute long autoscroller that provides a mazelike sequence you must navigate. Make a wrong turn, pick a wrong path, and you die. You die, you have to start the full level over and over. The auto scroller will perform fakeouts, trying to lead you into bad paths, so you *will not* pass it on the first time. It's a memory game. But not just that, Vortex aliens constantly assault you. I believe they kill you in 2 hits. Die, and you're back to the beginning of Welcome to the Machine.

So, now, lets say you beat Welcome to the Machine. TRIUMPH! VICTORY! Now, you only have one trial left. 

[The Vortex Queen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B66hTKMXXQ), an immense alien head. The Vortex Queen is hell, and is a multi stage fight that you have to survive. You're still very fragile and will die in only a couple hits. If you die?

THat's some hellish bullshit, right? That's not even the worst.

"Hi everyone.  I woke up this morning and found that I have inadvertently created a storm.  I'd like to say a couple of things right quick:

1.  I apologize for lambasting Seattle as a whole.  I was angry and upset and I took it out on the whole city when I should have directed it at the person or people that damaged my property.  Most of the people I have met in Seattle have been incredibly nice (on the surface at least - I have not had much time to go socializing yet but I have signed up for some MeetUps to meet some people with common interests), while only a few have been standoff-ish or rude, and even then that could have been just the result of them having a bad day or something, I don't know.

2.  I have received a couple of requests to talk to KOMO News and a Fox13 affiliate.  With regards to the media, I have some reservations about this.  I think I'm going to decline the requests, for a couple of reasons.  

While I have seen quite a few instances of tech backlash coming from a specific portion of the population, I do not think it represents Seattle as a whole.  I didn't make that post looking to get any kind of media exposure or publicity (though I do appreciate the offers) and while I definitely think stories shining light on this problem are a *great* idea, I don't think my story would be a good one to hold up as an example of some kind of tech discrimination or whatever.

If the journalists want to write a story about this problem, then that's great, because I think it is something that should be discussed, as it is a thing that affects the community as a large.  I'd be willing to offer some insight or commentary on a story, but I don't want to be quoted or interviewed because I just basically don't want the attention that comes with media publicity.  I made the original post just to vent and maybe draw some attention to something that I've seen happen more than once, but that was all.

&gt; What would you do differently?

Back before the turn of the millennium (I love that I can say that), and a hundred years before I discovered Reddit, I ran a site that had a community forum, about 35k members.  I modified the software to allow community moderation; essentially upvotes and downvotes.  I elected a few mods to enforce the rules, and I didn't have to do anything after that.  The rules, though, are what you and I disagree on.  My rules were simple:

- No bigotry-based threads (racism, sexism, hating on one group or another)
- No referral-based links
- (I'm having trouble remembering... but I'm sure there was another.  I like threes.  I'll edit if I can remember it.)

... and that's it.  A few base rules to keep things civil, and then the community would downvote crap and upvote the threads they liked, and *it worked.*  

Some people were friendly, some were assholes.  Some people posted news, others gossip.  Some people posted ""Looking to buy..."" and others ""Looking to sell..."" and, ya know, it all just worked out.

***The Secretaries* at Theater Schmeater**, Thu-Sat @8pm. Take the murderous rampage of ""Heathers"", the violent cultish attitudes of ""Caged Heat"" and the hair and clothes of ""Working Girl"" and you'd have the dark twisted romp of ""The Secretaries"" -Broadwayworld

***4,000 Miles* at ArtsWest** Wed-Sat @7:30pm. Seattle Times says it's ""a dance that’s awkward and graceful, in sync and out of balance, as a relationship between relations becomes real rather than pro forma.""

***Dog of the South* at Book-it** Opens tonight, Wed-Sat @7pm, Sat/Sun 2pm matinee. Based on the book by Charles Portis, also the author of *True Grit*.

***Savage Love* at the Pocket Theater** Sat @8:30pm, Sun @7pm. ""From the difficulty of expressing tenderness, to the fear of being replaced, to the hot anger of heartbreak: all of these and more are explored in SAVAGE/LOVE""

***Locally Grown* at New City Theater** Thu-Sun at all different times. A festival from the Radial Theater Project promising ""5 weekends. 9 productions. 32 performances.""

***Medicine Ball: Playwrights v. Poets - Valentine's Edition* at West of Lenin** Like a boxing match, playwrights and poets are paired off, given a prompt to write toward, and then the acting company performs the plays and poems produced in a series of seven rounds with the audience voting on who wins each round – playwright or poet.

"&gt; My issue is that most bike riders that I have seen don't abide by the same laws.

To be fair, the majority of drivers break rules left and right too. Almost everyone speeds on a regular basis, or rolls through stop signs, or doesn't use a turn signal. And arguably, those offenses are more dangerous than a cyclist running a red, because cyclists aren't operating two ton hunks of metal. I'm not saying it's *safe*, or that it doesn't endanger others -- a cyclist could run a red and not see an oncoming car, and the driver could swerve out of the way and hurt themselves or others. My point, I guess, is that I doubt most people who complain about cyclists breaking the rules hold drivers to the same standard, and I find this astonishing given how dangerous driving actually is. And though I don't bike much, I do understand why they run reds -- biking is all about keeping momentum, and starting up again can be a lot of work.

"I think one thing to note about the attitude in Seattle is that if you look back historically, this was one of the last places in the country to be discovered and then subsequently established for living by the European settlers and Americans. That attitude of pioneering and isolationism can still be felt today, though obviously not as strongly. 

Attitudes like that get passed from generation to generation; the pioneering spirit. Seattle and the surrounding Pacific Northwest has been an area that people go to escape the stereotypical sprawl of cities like LA, NYC, etc. and that may play a large part of why people are apprehensive to see MegaCorp dominating the skyline now. I'm not justifying acting like a hooligan and keying the working man's car, but there are attitudes and feelings that are unique to this area that might not be immediately obvious.

The Northwest has a very unique culture, and there are few places I've been to that share its values. Our roots in natural preservation and the outdoors have a big impact on not wanting to see it turn into a city like San Francisco, or become a metropolis, and I don't think that Amazon, etc. are trying to intentionally do that, but people like to associate the influx of people to our city as the herald to the end of the way things have been here. 

I see a lot of citing that it's good for the economy and the city to have business move in and then have the workers follow, but at what cost? Is it truly good in the end if we lose what made this city and area unique? There's no denying that cities all over the world begin to lose their unique cultural identities when immigration takes place, even if that might be from other cities within the same nation, particularly in a country as diverse and large as America is. That sounds xenophobic, but ultimately it's a fear of seeing the city grow to such a size as to see it lose its charm.

"In my experience the tech world stays to itself and rarely socializes in public.

The tech world is somewhat merged with the academic world. Its a very waspy and boring world where people keep to themselves and their known family or childhood friends.

A large part of this, in my experience, seems to be due to the bubble these people live in. I grew up poor and never went to college but I'm now a high paid tech worker. The people I work with were almost all privileged at birth and put on this path by their parents who fully paid their tuition, bought them a house, etc.

As a result those people spend a lot of time talking about ""making the world a better place"" but in reality they consciously or unconsciously shield themselves from reality and facing the negatives about the work they do.

tl;dr Techies are socially awkward with privileged backgrounds so you'll likely never meet them unless you already knew them or their ""circles"" to use a convenient Google+ term. This doesn't speak for all people but its the general atmosphere.

Also you try working on some insanely difficult work day in and day out for years while you're compensated ""well"" but you're smart enough to know you should be making $500k a year if companies weren't violating labor laws, etc to supress wages.

Then you try to go out and have a nice dinner, meanwhile your ""poor friends"" are crying about dying from lack of health care and stress from their part time minimum wage job. Really puts a damper on wanting to go out at all.

I do have a point of view and I was, as I pointed out, trying to get that across by asking a question.  This nitpicking does neither of us any good.  Let's agree that text can be a blunt instrument for communicating, and try to keep it in perspective when having online conversations.

"I grew up in Seattle and was 13 when the 1990s started, so I hope this helps. Watch the movie Singles and reruns of Almost Live for a fairly on-key sense of the zeitgeist.

In retrospect I think being a teenager in Seattle at that time felt like an amplification of the self-discovery that is a relatively universal experience at that age, with the confusion and angst that came  with being part of Generation X. I don't think I got much sense of what growing up in Seattle was like until I left it (college) and compared against others.

The city was going through a socioeconomic cultural shift at that time, transitioning from an ultimately disappointing dependence on traditional industry (Boeing planes, Weyerhauser paper, etc.) to the ""new economy"" typified by Microsoft and ""pacific rim"" influences like Nintendo. Meanwhile the world and national economy was starting to boom after a brief recession. Of course teenagers don't experience that directly, but there was definitely a sense of not having a clear local identity other than things such as a dislike for the inevitable Californianization of Seattle inherited from our parents (Subaru/Volvo families vs BMW/Acura families, for example).

Then all of a sudden, grunge happened: Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, Mudhoney, and all the rest were on MTV. Seattle mattered. It had an identity to the rest of the world which was awesome, but that identity turned out to be wholesale disenfranchisement from the rest of the world... which was itself disenfranchising. I think it started to make sense when the next wave of Seattle-based businesses blew up. Starbucks, Costco, Eddie Bauer, and the aforementioned Microsoft became ubiquitous. We got a season of the Real World, which was kind of sickening. Being in/from Seattle was then becoming partially a choice between embracing manufactured homogeneity or rejecting it. That's subtle, but  in some ways it was almost Fight Club cartoonish. In 1999, the WTO had some kind of convention and we had a riot in which someone rolled a gigantic statue of a globe through a Starbucks' window. I think I realized that there was more change going on in Seattle

The only thing the PIP really accomplishes is grinding the soul of the employee. ""Let us beat you up on the way out."" It's possible that the PIP served some purpose in Amazon's culture at one point, now it's just punishment.

"&gt; Flashing lights are just a hazard to many people. If bikes want to be treated like cars, then their lights should also act like car lights.

I think you have an attitude problem regarding people who bike and I'm sorry for whatever sad personal experiences led you to be such a bitter man, _but_ I do agree that in general bike lights should be designed more like car lights. Many bike lights do not have well thought-out optics. Strobing lights really aren't necessary at night (though they are helpful and not a risk during the day due to the increased ambient light and lower contrast). Really though, few bike lights are bright enough to be a serious problem - the average car headlamp puts out around 2000 lumens, most commuting bike lights put out under 1000. There are lots of flashing lights in a city which are far more distracting that a bike light - every police car, garbage truck, ambulance, school bus, fire truck, towtruck, WSDOT truck, and billboard has distracting lights. 

This issue comes up a lot when talking about bike lights, and I've yet to see a single anecdote - let alone published research - linking bike lights to actual seizures.

"It's like this:

Welcome to Capitol Hill!

It's a great neighborhood that was -- until recently -- full of amazing restaurants, bars, and local shops that worked together to make an amazing community. It was -- also, until recently -- a densely populated and affordable place to live. And we took all kinds! It wasn't just a gay-friendly neighborhood, it was a gay neighborhood that tolerated its straight friends.

Because of its inherent liberal nature, inclusive tendencies, and amazing clubs and bars it eventually became Seattle's hip neighborhood. And that was fine; there was plenty of Capitol Hill to go around.

But being hip has a downside. Being hip made it the neighborhood that people from out of town heard was, ya know, ""hip"", so they wanted to live there. 

At the same time Amazon and Microsoft and an untold number of start-ups started experiencing insane growth. Again, a good thing! So, to keep up with their own growth, these companies started hiring lots and lots and lots of people, many of them from out of state. And that's also fine!

But most of the new people didn't care about the punks and the gays and the people who had already made homes there. It just wasn't on their radar. It's not really that they didn't care, but more that they just didn't know.

The problem is that speculative land owners and developers rightly assumed that these new people would want to live in the hip neighborhood. They also knew that these new people would be able to afford a higher rent than the people who were already there could.

So, as asshole developers do, they started kicking people out of the affordable places they lived, and often have been for years, just to tear the old, classic buildings down in order to make new, ugly, expensive buildings. These buildings would house new ""fancy"" apartments that the people who used to live there couldn't afford.

There was a vibrant, artistic, awesome community that these people wanted to move into and that the developers were selling as a reason why to do so, but in doing that they effectively began dismantling it. There were many reasons to live in the neighborhood; the developers were promising the virtues of the area while simultaneously killing them with backhoes and deals with chain stores. And people like you have been buying it.

And this is where the vandalism comes in.

Again, I don't at all condone it at all, but I do understand it.

To some people you are the reason that they've lost their $975 a month one-bedroom with a view. To some you are the reason that their favorite dive bar is now an overpriced wine joint that under-pours or a chain pizza place or a yoga studio. To some you are the reason that their best friend had to move to Portland or Chicago or fucking Denver to do what they love where they can afford it.

You are not the cause of this, though. No, you are a symptom of the problem. Seattle is the fastest growing city in the country and the council has done next to nothing to make sure that neighborhoods can keep up with the demand without losing their identity.

The Capitol Hill of just five years ago looks entirely different than the one we walk through today, both physically and culturally.

So should someone have vandalized your car because you're new?

Nope. Not at all.

However you can't ignore the fact that people are frustrated that their neighborhoods are being torn down; that their favorite places are having to close; that their friends and their own selves have to find new places to live because their rent just went from $1100 a month to $1600; that the neighborhood that used to be a second west coast mecca for alternative lifestyles is now home to dude-bros who say things like ""Wait, there are faggots at this bar!?"" when they walk into a fucking gay bar; and, you know, a lot more of that kind of thing.

They were ""being such assholes"" because their habitat and way of life is being destroyed block by block with unchecked growth. You are -- whether you want to be or not -- part of that growth. People lose their homes when the rent skyrockets from what they can afford to what you can afford -- so you, by coming here, become a target, fair or not.

It sucks that some ""goddamn jackass"" scratched up your car. That shouldn't have happened and what's happening here is not your fault. That said, complaining about it on the Internet makes you appear as out of touch as the scratchers assume you are. They clearly don't want you in their neighborhood, and it's not hard to understand why.

Instead of being angry on Reddit you should try to gain some perspective here. These kind of things are going to get worse before it gets better.

Congrats on the new job. Welcome to Capitol Hill!

"They make this thing in some European countries called a ""bike lift"" and it's awesome, and it would be perfect for Seattle.

It's basically a slotted track that has foot-rests sticking out of it, powered by an internal chain or cable. To use it a rider simply rides up to the track and puts one foot on one of the moving pedals, which pushes them rolling up the hill on their own bike.

No dismounting, no riding a bus up a hill, no complicated stacking a bike on a contraption to carry it up.

You just stay on your bike and roll uphill. You can exit the lift at any point along the way and continue riding.

That said, Seattle's hills are tough, but you get used to them, and they'll whip you into better shape. There's also nothing wrong with getting off and just walking the bike uphill until it's flat or downhill again.

both in the reports we heard in community m

hardened by recent publicized videos of force

"A big reason why that number is low is because people avoid cycling in dangerous places. Places they'd have to go if they commuted to work, often. Very few people commute by bike. Those that do usually only do so because they are very experienced bicyclists or because they have a reasonably well protected commute (paths, safe bike lanes on low traffic streets, good intersections, etc.)

Moreover, it's not just about the statistics, it's about the perception of safety. It's very difficult to convince a novice bike rider that they should feel safe when they have to nearly rub shoulders with vehicle traffic, especially when that traffic very often tends to ignore they are even on the road. Even if statistically that sort of travel was safer than traveling by car, you'd have a hard time convincing most people of that.

P.S. Some additional stats:

In 2012 in the US there were 1.13 fatalities per 100 million vehicle miles traveled (vmt) for automobile travel (33.5k deaths, ~3 billion vehicle miles). In 2009 in the US there were 7.3 fatalities per 100 million vehicle miles traveled for bicycle travel. So statistically you are about 7x more likely to die, per mile, while bicycling than while driving, and driving is one of the most dangerous things people do on a regular basis.

Moreover, while many automobile fatalities are single car accidents where the driver was at fault around 90% of all bicycling fatalities are not the fault of the bicyclist. The statistics above actually hide how much more dangerous bicycling is because of this. The differential in risk of death between being a safe driver and a safe bicyclist is even more extreme than 7:1 due to the fact that when you are bicycling you are more likely to die due to someone else's negligence.",false,false,t1_codfdz6,rocketsocks,,0,1423255523,t5_2qhad,t3_2uzkjp,t1_codd0lt,19,1424114418,0,0,codfdz6,Seattle,19,,

"&gt;1.) The guy was clearly evading arrest/detention. I'm not sure what his alleged crime was, but he did something to initially draw the attention of the cops. He should have just accepted the outcome of his fate that evening, and let the justice system sort out any injustices if there were any.

Maybe so, but at what point is death a justifiable outcome to disobeying a police officer? 


&gt;2.) In the heat of the moment, the cops probably didn't know if he has a gun or not.

They know the job and all it entails, just thinking someone might have a gun is not sufficient grounds for taking someone's life. If it's okay to shoot someone in the heat of the moment because they may have a gun, then it should be okay for me to shoot any police officer I come across because I know they have guns and I know they are a threat to my safety. Shooting a police officer would be more justifiable than the murder I just watched. 


&gt;3.) He wasn't shot until he turned around after running several feet and faced the cops. It looked like he also lowered his hands down to his waist, normally where a gun might be. This was his fatal mistake. If he was going to surrender, he should have put his hands up or out where the cops could clearly see them.

Still no weapon present. The police have their weapons drawn and if the suspect brandishes a weapon, then maybe it's acceptable to open fire, but not before you know the suspect is actually a threat. 


You can blame the dead guy all you want, and my best guess is that he was probably an asshole since throwing rocks at cops is something he thought was acceptable, but he didn't deserve to die and the officers had many other options available.

"Seriously. Short-term and long-term prospects are good. 

Every team loses a few crucial pieces from year-to-year, but most of the core group of the team will be back. We lost a DC, but continuity should be maintained with coaching besides that (unlike one notable division rival). 

They've been planning ahead for inevitable contract negotiations with vital players like Wagner and Wilson so they shouldn't have any issues there, and they have adequate salary cap space to make it happen without having to make roster sacrifices to fit under the cap. 

We are more than likely going to lose a few important, but not absolutely essential players like Byron Maxwell, Zach Miller, and Carpenter/Okung. Players who will hurt to lose, but are not irreplaceable. We lost guys last year as well (including a couple of pro bowlers like Tate and Browner), and managed to recover or compensate for them. 

There are also some guys who haven't done much so far, but who look like they will be in positions to contribute (Turbin, Richardson, Matthews). 

It hurts now, but I'm not freaking about missing our chance at glory. This team will be back, and barring a lot of bad luck it will continue to be competitive.

"Sure.  For starters the guy looks white as snow and the headline says Police Officer calls Muslim ""Racist.""  It's intentionally creating a power dynamic of ""white cop"" vs ""brown muslim"" which is very titillating.  It ignores the fact that he's in fact a minority who feels marginalized by the Muslim.

He thinks that conversation is evidence of harassment.  I'll admit that this is a matter of opinion and wouldn't say anyone is wrong for considering it harassment.  I just think it's poor judgment to hold the video as a matter of fact.

The article links to another story of an officer who uses the phrase ""black racist"" and without explanation, just assumes it is relevant because they have the same employer.

He thinks this quote is obvious

&gt; Stating the obvious, here, but: It's completely bizarre for Seattle police officers to accuse people of color—who themselves are objecting to prejudicial attitudes—of being ""racist."" What alternate universe do they live in?

Which presupposes that Seattle cops (by either profession or location, unsure which because he doesn't clarify and this is a shitty article) are inherently racist.

The article also operates on the famous idea that POC can't be racist because racism = prejudice + power.  Which, fine, if you want to do that liberal arts circle jerk to make yourself feel better, that's fine.  So if you're of the belief that minorities can't be racist, I need you to come up with a word for a minority who is bigoted or prejudiced for racial reasons.  In the meantime, I'll stick with the word ""racist.""

"I'm originally from New England and regret my decision to move to Seattle. There are a lot of great things about Seattle, but for me the bad outweighs the good. /r/Seattle doesn't respond well to negative comments about their city so I won't go into detail unless people are genuinely interested. Just know that there is an unhappy minority out there that might give a different answer to your question.

**Edit:** Okay, it looks like there's some interest. I'll try and list out my thoughts but some of it is difficult to put into words. Obviously this is all my opinion and isn't true 100% of the time, but it's certainly things I've noticed.

###Good

####Food
Overall the food in Seattle is phenomenal. Thai is really good, same with Mexican (though many south westerners would disagree). Pacific seafood, like halibut and crab, is overall amazing, and is a fair/better replacement for Atlantic seafood like swordfish and haddock. 

####Beauty
The Pacific Northwest is extremely picturesque. Mt. Rainier, Puget Sound, Cascades, Seattle's Skyline... Need I go on? No one can deny PNW's beauty. It's a fact.

####Weather
Seattle is spoiled when it comes to weather. Summers are undeniably beautiful and comfortable, and winters can be described as mild. There are a lot of rainy days, but mostly it just sprinkles and is hardly worth complaining about. 

####Traffic
Traffic in Seattle is generally really easy to deal with. Rush hour doesn't last too long, and heavy traffic might make a commute an hour instead of 20 minutes, which is really not that bad. Sometimes if there's an accident traffic can be a nightmare, but that's true anywhere and overall traffic is manageable. 

###Bad

####People
Probably my number one complaint about Seattle is the people. I don't think people here are inherently bad, and I think everyone means well, but Seattle has developed a culture where icy personalities are the norm. I mean...the culture of everyday people is so pronounced it even has a name: Seattle Freeze. Where else has this? I've never heard of Chicago Freeze or Tokyo Freeze. Just Seattle.

First, the appearance of being nice trumps actually being nice. It's like everyone in the entire city is a waiter that doesn't actually care about you and just throws in an extra smile to get a better tip. Except it's worse because waiters don't lead you on into thinking you're friends by exchanging numbers and agreeing on plans that never happen.

People always say Boston is incredibly unfriendly and that people are rude there. Honestly, though, there are more genuine people in Boston than in Seattle. Maybe the guy at Dunkin Donuts was curt and impolite, maybe even rude, but at least he was being honest with you. He doesn't hate you, he doesn't like you, he just wants to get your coffee so you can leave. In Seattle the flirty Starbucks barista will lead you on into thinking you're building a relationship, but in the end it's all a farce. To me that is ten times ruder than the meanest DD employee in the world.

Second, everyone in Seattle is very *into* Seattle. Now I'm all for hometown pride, but Seattleites take it to the next level. I like to joke ""how do you know if someone is from Seattle? They tell you."" For example, someone posts a picture of their newborn baby, and they'll title it ""Just had a baby in Seattle!"" because they have to let everyone know they're from Seattle. Like...what does Seattle have to do with your baby? It's like when your coworker constantly reminds you they went to Harvard and they're somehow better for it.

Third, to Seattleites, Seattle is the greatest place on earth that has no faults. It's an attitude that says ""our positives are better than your positives"" and ""our negatives are the worst on the planet."" For example, everyone here complains about how it rains all the time when in reality it's really not that big of a deal. And as soon as you challenge that view (like I'm doing in this post) Seattleites get incredibly defensive and immediately ostracize you.

What's worse is that the longer I stay here, the more I start to be like this, and I hate myself for it.

####Drivers
Drivers here are really good about letting people in, using their blinkers, and being polite in general. Everything else about them is insufferable. They'll drive under the speed limit in the passing lane. They'll slam on their brakes and stop an entire lane of traffic to merge over a lane. They never get to the merge point when coming onto a highway and instead slide in at the earliest possible moment, making the next 1/4 mile of road unused. Parallel parkers don't know what they're doing and will block half a road as they try 15 times to get it right. If there's any kind of change in weather everyone forgets what they're doing and accidents happen every mile. I've seen on multiple occasions people sitting at a green light waiting for pedestrians to cross the road, and the five people behind them will just wait with them. And no one uses their horns so bad habits are perpetuated.

####Transit
The bus system is expansive and can get you pretty much anywhere in about two buses...if you know what you're doing. There is no rhyme or reason to any of the bus routes, and you can only navigate them if you have a smart phone because the only usable resources are Google Maps and One Bus Away. Sure, there's a train, but it shares a tunnel with buses so it can't run at speed or on a consistent schedule. 

####Winter
Living without the sun is really depressing. I think the worst part about it is your mood will start to decline for seemingly no good reason. Then the sun comes out for 10 minutes and you realize that it was missing from your life for a month and you feel so much better for seeing it. It's not ""dark"" so much as it is ""cloudy"", but it eats away at me more than any blizzard I went through.

"Some people can't get vaccinated.

Also, sufficient vaccination can outright kill off a disease which only lives in humans (see smallpox), but avoiding vaccination allows the disease to survive and possibly become resistant (see polio).  So avoiding vaccination can make vaccinations less effective as the disease adapts.

Also, even with vaccination, you can get sick in some cases if the disease is all over, it's not always perfect immunity.  Everyone being resistant means less exposure and chances for it to fall.

Also, even if they are only putting their kids at risk, they are putting their kids at risk.  And themselves.

"Short answer: no. 

Detailed answer:
The winters were darker than I expected, and that affected me a lot more than the rain ever has. I've loved how tame and ""un-wintery"" winters are, but I had to do some major self-care in order to get through the winters. Taking fish oil, vitamin D, working out regularly, and using sun lamps to wake up have worked wonders for me. 

As a student it's been difficult financially. Prices are high, and rent keeps going up. If I was a professional with a stable job, cost of living wouldn't hurt so much. That said, it's cheaper than San Francisco or San Diego. 

Socially I've struggled. I came here really outgoing and ready to meet new people, and a lot of my efforts fell flat. I met a lot of people, just not many who wanted to pursue deeper friendships. I've found that most of my friends have come from work or school, and about 80% are transplants themselves. 

If I were to do it over, I would jump into the workforce a lot sooner. I would also make a lot more of an effort to use sites like meetup.com. Going to social events like that were awkward at first, but I've met some great people that way. 

Culturally, it was not what I expected, in a lot of good ways. I love how politically and socially open this place is. Being different is totally acceptable, and even encouraged. I can just be me, no matter who that is. Great beer, amazing wine, a very strong music scene, what more could a guy ask for? I've loved the alternative culture here, and it's become something I want wherever I live.

"I posted about local theater you could support last week and that seemed to go over well. Here's some cool stuff you can see this week, with a bunch of great shows that are opening this weekend:

***Blood/Water/Paint* at Theatre Off Jackson (Live Girls Theater)** Opens this weekend, Fri and Sat @8pm, reception afterwards. The story of Artemisia Gentileschi, one of the only women painters of the 16th century and the struggles she dealt with. The show is a visual feast and showcases some of the best local talent around.

***14/48 Young Guns vs. Old School* at the Cornish Playhouse** Fri &amp; Sat @8pm. 14 plays written, cast, directed, rehearsed, scored, designed, and premiered in 48 hours by Seattle’s most daring theatre artists. Feb. 20 &amp; 21 – all artists 35 or younger. Feb. 27 &amp; 28 – all artists older than 35

***Voyage for Madmen* at West of Lenin.** Opens this weekend, Fri &amp; Sat @ 8pm. If you were a part of Seattle’s theatre scene in the late 1990s or early 2000s, you might remember Ardeo Theatre Project: the company who bought a chateau, moved to France to do theatre, and then crashed and burned spectacularly.

***Matt &amp; Ben* at the Hugo House** Thu-Sat @7:30. A fictionalized account of the rise of Ben Affleck and Matt Damon, as imagined by Mindy Kaling &amp; Brenda Withers.

***Locally Grown* at New City Theater** Thu-Sun at all different times. A festival from the Radial Theater Project promising ""5 weekends. 9 productions. 32 performances.""

***Zapoi!* at Annex Theatre,** Thu-Sat @8pm. Closes this weekend. The Stranger calls it delightful, deranged, and macabre. A dark and delicious phantasmagoria that examines a town in Russia where all of history is happening at once.

***Dog of the South* at Book-it,** Wed-Sat @7pm, Sat/Sun 2pm matinee. Based on the book by Charles Portis, also the author of True Grit.

***Savage Love* at the Pocket Theater** Sat @8:30pm, Sun @7pm. ""From the difficulty of expressing tenderness, to the fear of being replaced, to the hot anger of heartbreak: all of these and more are explored in SAVAGE/LOVE""

***Five Women Wearing the Same Dress* at the Renton Civic Theater** During a wedding reception in Tennessee, five reluctant, identically clad bridesmaids hide out in an upstairs bedroom, each with her own reason to avoid the proceedings below. As the afternoon wears on, these five very different women joyously discover a common bond in this wickedly funny, irreverent and touching celebration of the women's spirit.

***Our Town* at Strawberry Theatre Workshop** Thu-Sat @ 7:30pm, Sun @2pm. Getting really great reviews. The first show in the new mainstage theater at 12th Avenue Arts.

"Okay, being someone who does actually live in Pasco (btw we're in Franklin County not fucking Snohomish) I feel like I've got a pretty balanced view on this.  On the one hand, supposedly what happened was this guy was having an awful day because he had just gotten fired and was going for a walk to clear his head, and he got harassed by the cops because its a specific corner that has had some trouble with crime lately.  Supposedly the guy lost it, because he was essentially being racially profiled on his worst day ever, and started throwing softball size rocks at the cops (according to our local news, the reliability is anyone's guess).  

Here's the thing, the cops around here tend to be difficult people to say the least.  The specific cop that was involved, the one that was previously sued, he's been essentially stalking my sister and doing everything he can to harass her, ever since he pulled her over and she told him to fuck off and then he somehow found out she has a mental health issue.  For the last nine months or so the dude has been parking on our street nearly every morning, with his patrol car pointed at our house and his radar gun out trying to catch my sister or really anyone in our household, doing something wrong.  He is a thoroughly unpleasant person, but my parents refuse to get a restraining order or press charges because they think they'll be retaliated against by the entire Pasco PD.  On the other hand, there are a few really nice cops in town, I happen to be friends with a guy who works at the prison. 

Anyway, my point is Pasco isn't really normally like this, and the everyday citizens in Pasco are very nice people for the most part.

"Please keep in mind that the issue isn't just the cost of monthly rent, it's all the other requirements needed to get into the apartment as well.

You have to have a rental history of over 1 year, if you don't they require an additional deposit.

You have to have at least 3 references that aren't a relative, friend or coworker or they require an additional deposit.

You have to have a credit score of at least 700 or they as for an additional deposit.

You have to make 2.5X the rent in income or they won't rent to you at all.

Each one of those additional deposits is usually an extra month's rent.

So if you can find an affordable apartment with minimum wage, which are also usually part-time jobs, you still have to have all the money to get in the apartment which usually wipes out your bank account.

So if you find an apartment in the Eastside for less than $1000/month (good luck), say for instance you find one for $800/month then, if you are homeless, you need to put down:

First you have to have in income of at least $1600/month just to be considered, then you need:

* 1st month/last month - $1600
* Security Deposit - $800
* Low credit score deposit - $800
* No rental history deposit - $800
* No references deposit - $800

"I have a fun story for you. Up until post-WWII, lawn seed used to come standard with clover because clover is a nitrogen-fixing plant, thanks to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen fixing bacteria. If you ever uproot a clover, look for the little nodules on the roots. They're full of these bacteria. Prior to the invention of the Haber process, nitrogen fixing bacteria, thunder striking earth, and nitrogenous animal waste (guano) where the only sources of reduced nitrogen, aka ammonia. During WWI, England strategically cut off Germany from its guano trade, as ammonia is used in the production of explosives, poison gas, etc. Germany pressed its scientists for a way to develop ammonia without having to mine it and Fritz Haber developed the the Haber process, which entails putting N2 and H2 in a super high pressure chamber and reacting them to make NH3. Fast-forward to the end of WWII, after the Haber process becomes popularized on a global scale. There is so much ammonia left over from the war effort on both sides that they enact a paradigm shift in agriculture and farmers drop ""organic farming"" and start using ammonia fertilizers. What does this have to do with lawns? This is when they start taking clover out of lawns, to incentivize home owners to buy fertilizer!

"I'm a UW student. In my experience, we are unwelcoming to everyone. The YikYak on campus is clogged with people who are complaining about how no one is friendly to one another. However, the protest was advertised throughout campus under the name ""Black Lives Matter."" There is also the fact that there is a large population of Asian students. Sometimes those students also feel less valued. These students who feel marginalized want the University to do more for them. 

Personally, I think its bull. It is a very liberal campus, and everyone I've talked to is disgusted by prejudice of any kind. The University welcomes students of every race. In fact, students of color are likely to get grants based on race. Furthermore, I am repulsed by the name ""Black Lives Matter."" Do not all lives matter? I get that there is a serious issue with racial profiling, but there is definitely a desire to be a victim as well. 

The protest started in the Quad. I had to walk through to get from one class to another. As I walked through, I was given so many dirty looks I needed a shower. 

These are my experiences. The environment at UW is fundamentally unwelcoming, as it is in much of Seattle.

"From the RCW: 

&gt;""It shall be unlawful for any person to carry, exhibit, display, or draw any firearm, dagger, sword, knife or other cutting or stabbing instrument, club, or any other weapon apparently capable of producing bodily harm, in a manner, under circumstances, and at a time and place that either **manifests an intent to intimidate another** or that **warrants alarm for the safety of other persons.**""

Under the law, it's not just intent but whether the display ""warrants alarm"".  Its a grey area.  However, in practice, open carry with a holster or with a rifle slung over your shoulder (the reasonable ways to open carry) are insufficient to warrant alarm.  However, the photo in the article shows some of the protestors holding their riffles up in the air.  This is not responsible open carry or gun ownership.  

If you were to ask the protestors why they were there they'd likely quote Jefferson:

&gt;""...And what country can preserve it's liberties if their rulers are not warned from time to time that their people preserve the spirit of resistance""

In other words, intent to intimidate.

I fully support gun rights and believe that the new law is foolish.  However, there's the right way to protest and the wrong way to protest.  This is an example of the wrong way.

"I just moved here from a small town 20 minutes south of Atlanta on 2/1 and I gotta say... it's everything I hoped for and more. 

Living the small town life was killing me, especially since I didn't have a license. II had to be dependent on everyone for rides to go ANYWHERE and I hated it. Now I can go anywhere I want or need to and not have to ask for a favor from someone. 

People don't think about this too much either but Georgia's cold weather can be quite miserable. The air quality isn't exactly something I can write positive things about either. In cities that are on the water like Seattle, your air is quite crisp and clean. The cold doesn't seep into your bones so much as just pass through you. In Georgia, the air is just dank with swamp gas and whenever it dips into the 30's, you feel like you're swimming in ice water because of the mixture of the cold and humidity.

Sure, the skies are greyer, but I hate the sun with a burning passion; complete pun intended. I have incredibly sensitive eyes and if it's too bright out, I get horrible headaches. Living somewhere like Georgia, the sun is no stranger to you. Everyday seemed like a never ending struggle between figuring out if I'm suffering from caffeine withdrawal or if the sun's shining too brightly and I need to close the blinds.

One thing I wasn't expecting is spending so much time on my own. I'm alone quite often, but I don't really feel lonely. I know I can find company from someone just around the corner and that does comfort me immensely, especially considering I didn't have this kind of luxury back in Georgia. You want company? Closest company is about 5 miles in any direction.

The scene of people out here are also vastly different from the people I spent a good portion of my life around. Granted I've spent sometime in Manhattan so it didn't shock me to my core, but seeing all these people rallied behind the LGBTQ community out in the open is a pleasant change of pace after living in a state that's filled to the brim with ignorance. They aren't the only ones who stood out though, not for a long shot. I've seen so many freaks and weirdos (I'm one too so I say this in a "" One of us "" standpoint) that it feels like I can't walk anywhere without seeing one. It's amazing! I finally feel like I don't need to shun part of my personality and hide it shamefully in my closet. I'm finally free to be me, the whole me, and no one else. I'd damn well fight to keep this freedom too so I'm not going anywhere so long as I draw breath into my lungs.

It's looking like ST won't get the full taxing authority that it asked the legislature for, and without that extra money there simply won't be enough money to build a high-quality system linking Ballard and West Seattle to downtown. It's just not going to happen.

The proposed rail-convertible tunnel is an interim step to *greatly* improve bus service throughout West Seattle, Ballard, and on Aurora in the meantime while we wait to get enough money to build Link out further. Once we get that extra money we'll already have another tunnel downtown to link the system up to.

&gt;and neither is going through all the posts in /new and telling folks ""Hey, we can't have this here, please put it over here"". Lazy? We're taking the hardest possible route here, and attempting to provide the very best moderation to this community.

I've put up with people on reddit calling me Hitler and a variety of other terrible things, but lazy is a new one to me. You really don't know what you're talking about.

&gt;If your a curator, then you should want the option to bring in as much interesting content as possible.
The point of my comment was that we, the mod team, are NOT curators.

I would not have guessed that on my own, or from past interactions you have had with posters.

&gt;Your endless stream of because I said so is boring.
I'm happy to have a conversation with you, but you're going to have to hold up your end of it by being civil.

I haven't called you hitler once. Your answers often fall into two tropes ""we cant do that or x will happen"" "" tell me how you would do it so I can say we tried it or that you're wrong ""  However, good job adding new mods, that looked like a big positive step. Except no one knows what they have done or are doing really.

&gt;the rules you enforce appear to be stifling content, and asking why the built in system, that works elsewhere, can't be used here.

"Most of the supportive housing programs I've looked at are fairly selective with who can get housing, so I'd imagine that they could find ways to limit homeless people from other cities using the program.

Also, a lot of large cities have supportive housing programs (although the programs might not be as large as Utah's), and I haven't heard of this being a problem in any of those cities. For example (all links are PDFs):

* [New York City gave housing to about 5,000 homeless people](http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1067&amp;context=spp_papers). This is program did not save money, but the massive reductions in use of NYC hospitals and jails meant that the program nearly broke even

* [Los Angeles gave about 1,000 homeless people homes](http://www.lampcommunity.org/ckeditor/userfiles/images/1380324155_Where_We_Sleep_Costs_When_Homeless_and_Housed_in_Los_Angeles.pdf). The authors found massive reductions in public service use, saving the city money.

* [Canada also gave about 2,000 homeless people homes throughout Vancouver, Toronto, Winnipeg, Moncton, and Montréal.](http://www.mentalhealthcommission.ca/English/initiatives-and-projects/home) The program was nearly break even for high risk homeless people, but it was pretty costly for low risk homeless people.

For three years, Miniace has indicated that this current round of contract talks needed to include a pact on port modernization and technology, which is why the PMA called for an early start to negotiations nearly two years ago to work through the difficult issues of technology implementation.

Modernization is critical to relieving mounting congestion problems that threaten to thwart the movement of cargo.  “These congestion problems are acute, and pose a real threat to an already shaky economy.  Technology implementation is also a cornerstone of the federal government’s plans to enhance security at our nation’s ports.”.

It's also exceedingly difficult to get between neighborhoods, as there's a real lack of east-west routes. On the flip side, buses are generally clean and quiet.

"Hi. I work at the Space Needle and am a union employee. Non-manager. Throwaway for obvious reasons and I will answer any questions that allow me to keep anonymity.  Please note the the following is my OPINION.  These are the thoughts of a single SN employee and do not represent the feelings of the SN as a whole or the views of management. 

Let me first address the webinar. We receive these memos on a near monthly basis and they always cover different topics. These are written by a THIRD PARTY company and our management does not write them. Therefore they obviously do not reflect current events. 


The union, Local 8 is absolutely terrible. I don't want to speak on behalf of all employees here but most people hate them. Our union rep is terribly pushy and puts on this fake kindness when she's really just here to manipulate us into siding with the union. The truth is that the union and SN have been unable to meet an agreement in contract and that is why we have not received raises in years. This is not because our CEO or management. The management is ridiculously kind to us and treats us very well. We get all sorts of bonuses. I wouldn't at all be surprised if the union is the one holding us back from raises. Due to the fact that we are not in contract we don't even have to pay union dues. And most of us don't because WE DONT WANT THE UNION! 

The union constantly is asking us to do stupid shit such as ""hold a sign saying we need a raise"". What the hell is that going to do for us. Holding a sign isn't going to do anything. If any Local 8 union reps see this ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING FOR US and you might see some support. Also stop calling us and showing up at our houses. We don't want to deal with you off the clock. On the clock is difficult enough. 

We don't go on strike because we are proud of the work we do and genuinely love the Space Needle and (mostly) everyone that comes through our doors. It isn't an easy job but we are like a family here. So to all of you saying that our management is terrible and we need to go on strike, no we don't. It's the union that is terrible and I'm sure if they left us alone none of this would even be an issue. 

As I said, I'm happy to answer any questions without identifying myself. Thanks for your time. ",false,false,t1_coovbgo,SNemployee,,0,1424230329,t5_2qhad,t3_2w5cgu,t3_2w5cgu,12,1424650512,0,0,coovbgo,Seattle,12,,

The sad reality is that nothing will be done. In addition to spending a load of cash painting the rails on the sides, and the recent seismic retrofit the cheapest option for *fixing* this problem is an chain link wall on the lane side at a cool cost of 3 million.

Since the city has a huge backlog of transportation fixes, from green-ways to new boulevards, ( not to mention the new waterfront ) even if this was approved today it would get in the back of the line ( 10 years easy )

Politically, the Ballard bridge is a lot like the viaduct. The real answer is replacement, ( built in 1915 ) but that's crazy expensive, and would suck for years during tear down and rebuild ( like the south park bridge ) so the current political folks are just hoping it falls down or is hit by a boat they can blame it on.

"I moved here from Chicago almost three years ago.

We have absolutely nothing compared to the CTA.  Granted, it's much better than the vast majority of the country but it's still nowhere near what we need.  It's possible to survive here without a car, but you'll need to be careful about where you live and work.

There are several reasons for the current state of affairs:

1) The density isn't very high here.  Something like 60% of the city is single-family houses and it's hard to build among those.

2) The people living in those houses don't like change.  ""But good transit links will bring *those people* to my neighborhood!!"" ""Seattle isn't supposed to be a *real* city!""

3) Chicago follows the old model where the jobs are downtown and people live in neighborhoods.  Jobs are spread out here.  (see: Redmond, Bellevue, Kirkland, etc).  The reverse commute is much more common here than it is in the Chicagoland area.

4) It's very hilly and there's water.  Plus the ground is fairly soft.  This makes it incredibly difficult/expensive to build out a rail line.

5) ""Spend money to improve the city?  **FUCK YOU COMMIE SCUM!!  MY INSANELY LOW TAXES ARE TOO DAMN HIGH!!**""

6) The city doesn't have much clout in the state legislature.  This is in stark contrast to Chicago's relationship with Springfield.

But fear not.  Good things are happening.  It's going to take a loooong time to catch up but we'll get to where we need to be.

* Prohibit the city from ever entering a labor contract with any municipal union that doesn't include independent civilian control of all discipline. 

The idea then is that -- you can't legally FORCE the cops to take that deal. But you also CAN force the city to not take a deal.

- Shout down city council meetings--where the people who can make a difference are present--and cause enough disturbances to get kicked out of the meeting.

- Shout down pedestrians, transit riders, and motorists on at least three separate occasions in both the transit tunnel and on major arterials.  The rest of us ""aren't allowed"" to argue against that because lives are more important than, well, us living our lives.

Finally, a handful of protestors decide to shout down **the Chief of Police**, the woman who is factually, literally, and in reality responsible for all of the police officers about whom these protestors have grievances (at least the ones employed by the City of Seattle) and declare that she is speaking from a ""position of privilege"" so even having a community discussion with her is less important than repeating the declaration that lives matter.

Following the link in that blurb: http://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2018485057_shooting21m.html
&gt;King County prosecutors have declined to bring criminal charges against a sheriff's detective and a state corrections officer who invoked their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination in the shooting of a man who was severely wounded after possibly reaching for a flashlight.

I realize that invoking the Fifth doesn't automatically provide an assumption of guilt but it doesn't help either.  On the other hand: 
&gt;The wounded man, Dustin Theoharis, 29, who survived multiple gunshots, also has declined to provide a statement about what happened during a confrontation that lasted about 10 seconds in a dark room inside an Auburn-area house Feb. 11.

Something is going on there and we'll never know what.  None of it is confidence inspiring.

Real answer from someone that actually knows something about football: 

Fact: Marshawn Lynch is 1 for 5 this year on 1 yard stands.  

Fact: Marshawn lined up two other times against a stacked box and attempted a gut run yesterday.  Both times?  0 yards.  

Fact: marshawn is one of the more efficient backs in the league, except up the middle where he is below average in YPC.  

Fact:  The Patriots lined up a defensive front and were LOOKING for the run.  It's called red zone defense.

Fact: ""Beast Mode"" is a tackle shaker not a line breaker.  Giving him the ball there would have resulted in absolutely nothing.

"&gt;The lingering question becomes is landlord responsible for light bulbs? The answer is both yes and no. Renters could claim that as light bulbs are part of the apartment and are as much a responsibility as a lock on a window. However, inside an apartment a landlord is not responsible for how often a tenant turns on and off the lights, or leaves their lights burning for extended periods of time, among other things that can cause light bulbs to burn out. Therefore, when it comes to light bulbs inside an apartment or house that is being leased by a renter, it is the renter's responsibility to replace the bulbs, unless otherwise specified in the lease itself.

Not legally binding, but I'd say it makes sense. I've always replaced lights in my apartments (unless it was something weird like the fridge light or oven light).

If you want to attack the market of sexual exploitation, then attack the market for sexual exploitation, not prostitution in general. There will always be a demand for sex. It is the nature of the male sexuality. Any policy ignorant of this is just that. Ignorant.

"The funniest fucking comment in the world:

""This is really bad reporting. This article seems to emphasize on painting the girls as helpless individuals who needed Harper, the knight in shining armor, to save them from this vicious Asian wielding a knife. 
What the people commenting before me fail to see is how biased this article is. Still, just by this article alone, you can see that Harper is full of it. And please, just because he is in the National Guard doesn’t automatically make him a saint. I have the utmost respect for our men and women in uniform, but that doesn’t mean I can’t hold them to their own high standards. No system is perfect, and although many of those serving are exemplary individuals, there are a few bad cases, and I fear Harper is one of them. 
“’Out of my abdomen my intestines were coming out,’ said Harper. After nearly a week in the hospital he is walking with a cane, and doctors say he could have died.” So a life threatening injury somehow begets a week recovery? Harper is already back at his frat. I’m pretty sure that something that bad would require a much longer recovery. Exaggeration is being used to make Harper sound all the more a hero and a victim of assault.

"Not sure if you are looking for city specifically or not...

I don't live directly in Seattle itself (kitsap county) but I moved from Northern New England a couple years ago. My wife and I wanted a change and kept open most places in the US as options. 

I read a ton about the weather and things to do. I did a Google search on moving to Seattle and read everything and for me it turned out to be exactly as described if you don't kid yourself. My wife and I don't like the heavy heat or humidity and don't mind rain if it it swapped out dealing with snow. I knew a rain coat and no sun for long stretches were something I preferred to snow and extreme cold. To me just because you see sun 0 degrees it is still shitty. Don't try to pretend you will be ok with it. If you have had a week of rain and got really annoyed by it where you live now then it doesn't change here. The summers are AMAZING but again you will probably see months of clouds and rain during the winter and a great summer doesn't queue you up to ""handle"" it. 

People wise my wife and I both work so we are similar to what people say about the Seattle freeze. We fit in with people like that and didn't expect anything different. We like plutonic friendship where we hang out occasionally but don't want to meetup several times a week. 

I prefer Seattle as my base city vice Boston in almost every aspect but that is very personal preference and your life style. I like that the airport is simple and has a single airline you can use to fly anywhere direct and earn miles. I also love the time zone for sports and TV. Great to watch important events that don't end at 11pm. 

Activities can easily be researched to see if you will like them since that is also personal preference but online gives you all the details for those types off things. Id say it's a very simple destination city. Most amazing things are like trips to do something nature wise which is hard to coordinate on a vacation. Living here though it basically provides unlimited options since you have weekends and holidays and staycations to see it all.

"Yeah, ummm...that was me. Still sitting in the same seats, Section 119 behind first base.

Full story: season ticket holder since '94, back when the chant was the sing-song ""Ed...gar...Ed...gar..."". I was there for all 3 games in '95--one of my most cherished baseball memories (after The Double of course) is tens of thousands of people chanting Edgar as we left the Kingdome after the insane game 4 comeback victory. 

I blew out my voice chanting Edgar during that series, and then again the next year, so I decided that I would only do once, and if I was going to do it only once, I would do it long, and I would do it LOUD. And I got pretty good at it :-)

It changed a bit over the years. Edgar never reacted one way or the other, but pitchers often did. After one pitcher started quick pitching while I was still bellowing, I switched to immediately after the first pitch, which *really* bothered some pitchers. I did it after first pitch every game I went to until Edgar retired.

Edgar knew who I was, and once sent me a pair of autographed batting gloves, but he never reacted one way or the other during games.

My favorite reaction of all time was Rickey Henderson, who stood at the end of the dugout with a shocked expression then burst out laughing.

First base coach John McClaren (sp?) used to love it to--he'd give me a thumbs-up behind his back after a particularly good one.

Some pitchers it really seemed to bother, particularly if they missed a strike call close on the first pitch. I got more than one irritated glare in those years.

I never did it again after Edgar retired. I moved to the East Coast, had kids, and despite living away from Seattle for 10+ years, never gave up my season tickets. 3 years ago, moved back to Seattle and now I'm back in those seats.

There hasn't been a player since who I've felt motivated to cheer for in the same way, so the Edgar yell is probably retired for good.

Unless of course, he makes it to Cooperstown. I WILL be there for that. #edgarhof #itstime.

"So, I am not sure how you test for mold on a plant, since mold spores are nearly always present in the air. I know I sound nitpicky, but I am also trying to prove a point.

Can you define the terms you listed?

* Solid strain  - what defines a strain? is it defined by the producer, some organization or just the seller? Are ""strains"" objectivly definable, or just identifed by the producers/seller

* no genetic inconsistencies - how is this defined? do all ""strains"" recieve DNA testing? Because I buy bananas all the time and I don't wonder if they are genetically consistent. Are you implying there is some GMO ""strain"" that needs to be watched out for?

* It's organically grown - according to federal organic certifications? because even with generic produce those are considered really flimsy. Is it oregon tilth certified? Who decides its organic? is it just the producer seller?

"The comments from the survey were received by the City’s Office of Cable. From that survey, it was made clear that the residents of Seattle want more choice. This week, DoIT presented to City Council legislation that we believe could achieve that goal. Currently Seattle is divided into “Cable Franchise Boundaries.” These boundaries have been in place for several decades and have resulted in about 80% of the city only having a single cable provider. By removing boundaries, it will make Seattle more attractive for more cable television providers to offer service in Seattle, thereby giving consumers more choice, better service and hopefully, better prices.

The Comcast franchise is still under negotiations. As a reminder, these negotiations only apply to cable television and not to the Internet. Internet is currently regulated at the federal level.

"For the most part most people you meet will be really nice, welcoming, and even generous. 

However just because they are nice doesn't mean they are your friend which is a mistake I've made. 

In some ways I can compare it to school. You may have a peer you sit next to in class and talk with but outside of class they don't sit with you at lunch or hang out with you after school. They're an acquaintance but not a friend. 

So I've got people that'll just go hike with me, another group of people I Meetup with for humanist events, a different group of people to meet at the dog park with, then I've got the people I joke with at the pub on occasion, etc but none of these people despite the frequency I see them are friends. They don't come to birthdays, they do not come to BBQs, or chill on your couch. An acquaintance just isn't the same as a friend. 

I have made a few friends but honestly it took awhile. One of them is a neighbor I saw frequently and the other three are people I talked to for over a year before finally hanging out. It's like you have to ease into it, when I straight up invited people over to grill and drink beer they'd avoid me, as if I was some psychopath.

Maybe it's just harder for me because I don't have co-workers, my husband works from home, we are hermits during the week and like to have lazy Sunday. So Saturday is our day unless there is an event during the week we are up to attending. People that put themselves out there more will have more success because they'll have more opportunities to meet people. 

Edit: there are different types of people depending on the area. I started off on the east side which I do like but somehow people were harder to meet there whereas on the west side people are more laid back.

"You know, as someone attending a Public Safety Occupations class and after a recent trip to the Washington State Patrol Academy, let me delve on your thought of 'shoot him in the leg or something'.

According to /u/MapsAreCool quoting another unknown source, which we will in this instance play off as 'or something'. Yes, according to them, he was previously tased, and it had no effect. 

In this instance, there was no extreme harm to life, as could be present with perhaps a knife or a firearm, and yes, the units could have had the time on their side to obtain more options in order to stop the individual. Heck, the most useful tool that an officer has, is his mouth. Granted this doesn't stop bullets or stop someone in a drug induced rage, if anyone decides to chomp at my bit about that, but there have been situations where firefights in progress have been stopped by the officer talking them down.

The other tool would be the Taser...Why the guns were brought out I'm not sure. I can't make any assumptions and jump on the all-cop-hating bandwagon, because I'm just someone sitting behind a screen, who does /NOT/ know the circumstances surrounding the incident. 

The only thing I can tell is in about the 0:18 to 0:20 seconds, he seems to throw his arms down center mass, which they /may/ have mistaken for drawing a weapon. 

The reason why I mention the field trip, is because we were fortunate enough to be able to try out their simulator for all sorts of deadly or regular encounters; Be it that of a truck stop, a robbery of a store, etc..In my scenario, I was a responding officer to a mall, an active shooter. People yelling, crying and screaming, telling me there was someone in a gun in a store. And these were real people, acting in actual places around Washington. I kept my eyes peeled, watching the doors. Someone comes out, one hand in their pocket. They turn to me, raise their hands, then the shooter comes out and immediately knocks him to the ground with a shot to the chest. I level him down with 3 shots--First in the arm, nothing done. Second in the waist, which incapacitated and killed him. The third, an unintentional, but shot in the neck.

Proceeding further down the mall I make a left turn, more units responding carrying rifles. I can barely distinguish them. Then a woman comes out, not dressed like a criminal at all, pulls out a revolver and is about to shoot--I manage to get one shot in her head, another in her shoulder, and one in her hip. Whether she was an active shooter or not, or just someone trying to play hero, I will never know, and it certainly sticks with me as to understanding that we can't just sit back and say 'what if' 'why didn't', because we're missing out on information.

"I think that's the movies skewing your perspective as well. 

Shoot to kill is often taught for many reasons. One of the primary reasons is any shot could potentially kill. Even a shot to the leg could cause massive damage to arteries and bone that would eventually kill. More important though, is the misses that could kill anyone around. Every time you pull the trigger you should realize that death could be imminent, even if not intended.

Another reason, that isn't ""taught,"" is on the legal side. Even if someone pulls a gun, and you magically shoot them in the arm, disarming them of their weapon, and no one dies, they can then make a civil lawsuit for damages. If they don't pull a gun, then you run the risk of being charged criminally as well.

The simple fact is that a gun is deadly force, you use it to cause death. That's the way it should be seen. If you manage to use it otherwise successfully congratulations, but it's not something to be taught by any means.

I suppose the police might train other ways, which would be stupid, but the military policy taught was if you aim a gun, be prepared to kill someone (which is obviously generalized, so I am not going to continue arguing this point).",false,false,t1_cojthm5,idontknowhowreddit,Pioneer Square,0,1423789162,t5_2qhad,t3_2votoi,t1_cojslxy,10,1424559004,0,0,cojthm5,Seattle,10,,flair

&gt;“Since the birth of our democracy, it has been well settled that government cannot take from its citizens without due process of law,” Barbara Linde, who was then chief judge of King County’s District Court system but who is now in Superior Court, scolded legislators at a 2010 hearing.

&gt;“In my view, it will only be a matter of time before an aggrieved citizen — and there will be many aggrieved citizens — brings a class-action lawsuit,” she said (italics mine).

&gt;Once again, the person nobody listens to turns out to be right.

&gt;On Thursday, three law firms filed exactly that class- action suit. It argues that the 520 bridge’s tolling fines and bureaucratic appeals process are so tilted against the people that they are unconstitutional, as well as in violation of consumer laws.

&gt;“People are being gouged by the government in ways no private business could get away with,” summed up attorney Mary Anderson.

&gt;The suit is derived from toll horror stories in the news for the past three years. They go like this: Commuter crosses bridge, has some glitch with photo-tolling account or never gets bills in the mail and — wham! — commuter is hit with eye-watering fines. There’s no place to appeal but a merciless administrative review set up by the transportation agency itself.

&gt;I have told some of these stories, and I hear new ones every week. (My email in-tray would be a rich class-action client pool.) The main grievance is that the state feels it isn’t obligated to send out toll bills. And that the fines, $40 on each missed toll, are so steep they can turn minor account snafus into multi-thousand-dollar collection actions.

&gt;Take Nicola Livic, of Redmond. He has a transponder on his car, linked to a credit card to automatically pay his tolls. But when his credit-card number was changed by the bank (due to a fraud issue), his online account stopped working.

&gt;No big deal. Except that the motor-vehicle department had his mailing address wrong (his ends with a box number, #44, that somehow got dropped.) So all the subsequent mailings alerting him to new tolls and his growing fines never reached him.

&gt;The total damage by the time he realized what was going on: $3,545. Less than $300 of that is for actual tolls.

&gt;When he appealed at the state Department of Transportation (DOT)’s University District office, he was told that ignorance of fines was a poor defense.

&gt;“It felt like a kangaroo court,” Livic says. “I’m culpable for not monitoring my Good-To-Go account as closely as I should. But the punishment is way out of whack for an address error that wasn’t mine.”

&gt;It used to be that a missed toll payment was like a parking ticket. You could go to a local court where an elected judge with significant leeway would hear you out.

&gt;But in 2010, the DOT requested that these cases be switched from the courts to an administrative process set up by the DOT. It enlisted administrative-law judges to staff the toll courts, but didn’t give them much flexibility on how they could rule.

&gt;Crucially, fines collected now go to the DOT. An average of $65,000 just in fines is assessed on the 520 bridge each day.

&gt;Judge Linde warned lawmakers back in 2010: You’re setting this up so DOT designs the system, issues the infractions and oversees the appeal process. Plus it gets the fine money.

&gt;“It will be anything but the independent process that citizens expect,” she said.

&gt;I’ve argued that fining people $40 for each $4 missed payment is a level of gouging you won’t see from the worst payday-loan shop. Better would be to charge no fines but attach unpaid toll bills to license-tab renewals, as they do in British Columbia. Tough but fair.

&gt;What happens now? The person who was right in the first place made a guess about that, too.

&gt;Judge Linde noted in 2010 that the inevitable class-action suit would be weighed by judges who tend to take a dim view of “tossing citizens into an administrative process.” There’s a big risk the state will lose, she said then. If so, it will put the taxpayers on the hook for “having to repay toll penalties, along with triple damages and attorneys’ fees.”

&gt;Or the state Legislature could act, now, and try to fix all this. They sure can’t say they weren’t warned.

Look at the last play and you will see a well designed play where Browner is matched up on Kearse and all Kearse has to do is clear three yards of space so Lockette can come underneath and Butler has to at least side step to get to Lockette, but can't make that hard crash that got him the INT. What happens to Kearse? He get's jammed so hard at the line that Lockette cuts short and the rest is history. It's insane that people are calling that a bad play because even with Kearse just absolutely shitting the bed on it they almost scored anyway.

"Actually you're out your damn mind. I watched one of my friends go from an average person going to school and working part time to a completely crazed woman who burst into tears over a barking dog.

The dog barked day and night but the owner claimed to be ""deaf"" and unable to notice the dog. Weirdly though she seemed to talk quite a bit on the phone for that. Oh well, back to the friend.

The only way she could work in her home was to blast music and sit near a window because the shrill yapping would echo throughout her apartment. At night, like most people, she sleeps in a quiet environment but the dog would bark. and bark. and bark. and bark some more. She couldn't sleep. She would go for extended periods on little to no sleep and eventually it took a toll. 

Like most people say the city rarely enforces complaints and her landlord refused to touch it with a ten foot pole. She (like many students) couldn't afford to break her lease and she couldn't destroy her rental history by not paying because she still needs to be able to live places after this. 

She had a mini-breakdown in her hallway one day so myself and other people started to offer her places to sleep most nights and that did tend to get her back to her regular old self.

"I was raging about vaccinations on our school, which are reported to be about 12%, and my wife told me the following.

When you walk into school the first day to register your kid and send them to class, they need you to have a bunch of paperwork, including your vaccination papers. If you don't have them, you can't send your kid to school. However, the ""personal exemption"" slips are sitting right there on the administrator's desk as they explain this. So, it's a lot easier to just fill out the personal exemption than it is to go dig up the missing paperwork. Even for parents that get their kids vaccinated. As a result, she tends to think that the numbers at our school in particular are inflated.

So, one way to make this problem both actually smaller and to eliminate over-reporting of exemptions would be to make exemptions _harder to get than the vaccines._ That is, you have go see a doctor every year and receive information about vaccines and why they are good for you and then you have to go through some complicated paperwork process to become exempt.

"Anyone arguing that SLU is worse than it used to be either wasn't there to witness it, or is actually making the related, but ultimately specious argument that SLU is worse than it *could potentially have been*.

SLU is most definitely better than it was 20 years ago, which was a great place to get stuck in traffic, have your car stolen, dump trash in an empty lot, race cars at 2 am without driving down to SODO or Kent, eat greasy food after a hangover, or shoot heroin. South of 85th and Aurora, it was the best place in Seattle to park a car so a hooker could blow you without anyone caring or noticing. There was an Evening Magazine Best of Western Washington vote and everything. There's a reason the trolley is called the SLUT.

And the reason why Vulcan and other developers decided to build up that area is almost certainly due to it being *greatly undervalued property* for the location, potential, access, and views. It was the armpit of Seattle. It was the armpit of Seattle 100 years ago during the nearby Denny regrade when SLU was known as the best place to sink an old wood boat, sleep on mud, or visit a cemetery. (Denny Park itself was a cemetery!). It was backwater, literally, because there was a big old hill between it and Seattle, Denny Knoll. That was the dirt source for the regrade. Lake Union once was lower than Lake Washington with no channel connecting the two, so the entire town got fucked once they dug a channel. Then, once the locks were built like a decade later, and Lake Union was brought up to Washington's level, the little town was flooded and fucked again, and this is why Lake Union is a bit larger than it once was. The Denny regrade, done with a lot of hydraulic mud flow, fucked SLU. The cascade coal industry that sprouted up and then went away like a fart in the wind fucked SLU as well. The cascade timber industry that came and went fucked SLU. Then it was railyards, drydocks, garbage dumps, worker housing, and cemeteries. It was the wood boat capitol of the West (Go see the museum there). And, of course, that boat-building industry was fucked as well by the building of low-level bridges, among other issues.

Getting fucked in SLU is apparently one of its fine traditions.

It was the armpit of Seattle 50 years ago when it was big utility buildings, car lots, car repair shops, and cemeteries. South Lake Union has been a great place to die for 150 years. People lie there buried under dirt. Boats lie there buried under water. Industries died there, time after time. But it's also been a place of rebirth, a cycle that has happened in SLU about a dozen times, and probably more than any other place in Seattle. A hub of grand, optimistic plans left unfinished, again and again. Every city planner that ever existed in Seattle seems to have churned out a big damn plan for SLU. SLU has been rebuilt probably more than some towns in tornado alley.

Oh sure, there were many worse places in Seattle prior to the recent development, but SLU was special in the 80s as being both crappy and boring. It had no personality or reputation. Soulless is ironically the absolutely perfect way to describe SLU as it once was in the 80s-00s when it was a hodgepodge and nothing notable was happening in the area.

SLU is the goddamn perfect area for tech and biotech industries to rapidly build on. It's probably written in a prophesy carved in stone somewhere. You talk about South Lake Union having no soul, and I say that *this is its soul*: Rebuilding. Rebuilding on mud, trash, dead people, and dead industries.

&gt;Because I have a one-track mind, my immediate reaction to the Vision Zero list was fear that lower speed limits on MLK would slow down the Link trains there, where traffic signals currently enforce the 35mph limit.

&gt;I think this is the right call. Our regional transit spine needs to be fast. Professional drivers operating in an intricately designed signaling system need not have the same safeguards as ordinary people with uneven levels of distraction. Most importantly, fast transit gets people out of cars, and that will save more lives than slowing down trains.
