"Here is a good summary from WaPo today:

'First, there is a section in the Indiana that clarifies that a “person” can include a partnership, company, joint-stock company and other for-profit businesses. This language appears to be related to the recent Supreme Court ruling in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby, in which the court ruled 5 to 4 that the federal RFRA protected family-owned companies from complying with the contraception mandate in the Affordable Care Act.

Pence mentioned the Supreme Court case in his remarks, but it’s worth noting that generally such definitions of a “person” are already in the U.S. Code under what is known as the Dictionary Act. So the practical effect may be minimal.

Second, and potentially more important, the Indiana law has this section:

    “A person whose exercise of religion has been substantially burdened, or is likely to be substantially burdened, by a violation of this chapter may assert the violation or impending violation as a claim or defense in a judicial or administrative proceeding, regardless of whether the state or any other governmental entity is a party to the proceeding.”

By contrast, the Illinois law says this:

     “If a person’s exercise of religion has been burdened in violation of this Act, that person may assert that violation as a claim or defense in a judicial proceeding and may obtain appropriate relief against a government.”

There are two important distinctions — the language saying the government does not need to be a party and the addition of “likely” to be burdened.

With one exception (Texas), the language regarding the government not needing to be a party does not appear in any other RFRA. But as Shruti Chaganti noted in an interesting 2013 article in the Virginia Law Review, federal appeals courts have been split on whether the RFRA could be used in a private suit.'",false,false,t1_cpx41eb,cmk2877,Capitol Hill,0,1427837083,t5_2qhad,t3_30xyai,t1_cpx2knf,15,1432123839,0,0,cpx41eb,Seattle,15,,flair

"I regularly fly both Delta and Alaska.  Delta is great internationally, but in the states is a bit of a dump - old planes, surlier employees.  It's not possible at a Delta gate to make a flight change - something business travel comes to expect, that Alaska supports.

Delta has been competing with sub-profit pricing in Alaska's ""back yard"" routes, like Seattle to Portland and Seattle to Boise.  This sucks if you're under a corporate policy of being required to take the lowest flights.  I get stuck on the 1-stop Delta to Denver because it's priced at $240 total, versus the Alaska non stop, priced at $320 total.  This in turn can cause Alaska to not offer flights through Expedia-like corporate branded travel sites like Concur.

The whole thing hopefully doesn't screw us out of Alaska.  They've been the ""home town"" airline forever, they do nice things like free beer on the small plane routes, and if you are based in the Northwest they are definitely still the way to go.  But Delta's got the deep pockets to starve them out, take losses on Alaska's routes long enough to put Alaska in a ""beg to be acquired"" position, which is probably what Delta's plan is.

Will it work?  I hope not, but it probably will.  Alaska's just a better airline for customer service than Delta, particularly for business travel to places in the Northwest, but ... you can see Delta's coming hard and they do have the deep pockets.  I doubt strongly they will keep prices low once they force Alaska to submit to them, though.

I've worked closely with Sound Transit each step of the way and they have been very supportive of these efforts. I'll keep an open mind on a higher level of authority for ST3 if the Democratic House leaders are able to pass a comprehensive state-wide package and make a higher level of funding to Sound Transit part of that package. We can't delay on these important investments in both transit and congestion relief.

"I live and work on Pike btw Broadway and 12th, and here are my two cents:

* 95% of the week, there are no abnormal traffic/pedestrian issues. Delivery trucks use the turning lane on Pike to park while making drops, usually during the morning. Bus routes use Pine each direction. *The city has done a good job designing the street so very few people drive fast on Pike btw Bway and 12th... There is no car speed/pedestrian safety issue in my opinion.

* The issue is on Friday/Saturday night, it often takes 5 minutes to drive the distance of a single block. Crossing Pike on 10th or 11th is almost impossible. Driving along Pike is equally horrid. The combination of taxis, ubers, lyfts, for hires, private vehicles, and the throngs of pedestrians is simply to much volume for the tiny area.


My solution is to shut down Pike (from Broadway to 11th, inclusive of 11th, so cars could not cross Pike at 11th, but they could come down Pike to 11th - this is necessary for residents of 1111 Pike) to cars from 8pm-3am Friday and Saturday nights. Here's why:

* The only driveways in this stretch of Pike are the Cafe Vita loading dock and the parking lot East of Poquito's. The Shell station has access on Broadway.

* Vita doesn't really need to use their loading dock this time of night in my experience. Sometimes they have a food truck or artist or something in there, but they don't need vehicle access during those times. Such a food truck or artist would simply need to be in the loading dock by 8pm, work til 2, clean up, and leave once the street opens again at 3am.

* The Poquito's parking lot is a horrid use of urban space. It could sit empty on Friday/Saturday for all I care, or it could be used for food trucks or a little art market on Friday/Saturday nights. Think the Frenchmen Street art market in New Orleans, if you have ever been. The loss of use of this parking lot on Friday/Sat is necessary with this plan. Hopefully a building is built there soon. Surface parking lots like that are worthless in an urban setting like Pike/Pine.

* Tour buses could access Neumos via 10th from Union.

* Residents of 1111 Pike (modern red building) could access their garage, as it is between 11th and 12th, outside my proposed zone.

* All access to buildings/garages along 10th and 11th remains in-tact. Anyone traveling from Pine south on 10th or 11th is probably either a resident who needs to access their garage, or confused, and will need to turn around upon seeing the closure of Pike. Same is true of those traveling North on 10th or 11th from Union. Over time, as drivers learned that those streets were effectively dead-ends, they would be less and less confused dead-enders, and only residents needing to access garages would use those streets during the Fri/Sat closures. Good signage could help with this.

* There would be 5 temporary dead-ends on Friday/Saturday (two each on 10th/11th, and one on Pike btw 11th and 12th). The taxis and ride shares would learn that picking someone up along the 5 temporary dead ends would require a u-turn, which is not impossible, but a pain in the ass. Bar-goers calling cabs/ubers/lyfts would learn to drop their pins on either Union/12th/Pine/Broadway to avoid the necessary u-turn, which would drive up their fares and increase to time it takes to get home. Union/12th/Pine all move cars much quicker (Broadway less so) in and out than Pike presently does, which is where everyone drops their pins now.

* One of the most appealing things about this plan is that it requires almost no up-front investment to try and adopt. All the city needs to do is drag some street barriers to the corners that I identify, and have the cops that are already on Pike at that point of the night, give guidance to drivers about the new changes. No planters, no construction, no permanent changes.

In your warped worldview, a few immigrant-owned businesses represent the ""power"" in this situation? Absolutely ridiculous.

She said the latter benefit already exists via informal social networks. “We’ll let the neighborhood know all the new information,” she said. “For those people who don’t speak English or read English, I’ll explain to them what change is coming” from developers or city construction projects, for example.

and

I've cut contact with her multiple times for extended periods of time because it's the only way for her to understand that she can't push my boundaries, but eventually she decides to push, gets upset and preachy when I tell her she's overstepping, and I have to cut contact again.  Friday I called her for the first time in over 6 months and she went straight into pushing my boundaries and trying to get me to talk about things that I've told her, multiple times, are not up for discussion (my fertility and my marital status .. sensitive issues since I have fertility issues and she knows this, but still demands I give her grand children like my body belongs to her).

My brother has attempted suicide multiple times and been in and out of therapy because of the way she's treated him.  She ""doesn't understand"" how he can be so *mean* to his mother and that she's his family (she isn't), but it's for his own mental and physical health.  She doesn't understand how he can't be ""normal"" like everyone else, but her only children that aren't disabled really do not like her.

For the uninitiated, a crossbore is when a gas pipeline is inadvertently installed within a sewer pipeline.  This is safe if undisturbed, but if your sewer is blocked, and you use a roto rooter or a plumber, and the plumber then punctures the gas line, that creates an emergency situation pretty quickly.

"Definitely an April Fools Joke. From the URL on the board:

&gt; Ivar’s Acres of Clam Announces Remodel for Indoor Pot Farm.
&gt; Head chowderhead stokes chowder recipe for customers’ health, not just for the halibut.
&gt; 
&gt; SEATTLE – April 1, 2015 – Since 1938, Ivar’s Restaurants have proudly served the world’s best clam chowder. Today, more than 75 years after “Flounder” Ivar Haglund started lighting up the appetites of Seattleites, the chowder it sells throughout the U.S. and abroad is made at its dedicated chowder plant north of Seattle. There, Ivar’s produces more than 5,000 gallons of our famous chowder each day, but Ivar’s Acres of Clam on Pier 54 still houses Ivar’s recipe development branch.
&gt; 
&gt; Recently, Ivar’s customers, always first on the company’s priority list—have piped up. They’ve stated that because they know salmon is so heart-healthy, they sometimes feel “guilty” ordering chowder, and asked Ivar’s to make its chowder more wholesome, so they don’t burn their chances to pack in nutrients at every meal.
&gt; 
&gt; In response, Head Chowderhead Mary Jane Greene has been researching ways to make Ivar’s chowder more nutritious. Following recent changes in Washington State legislation, which prompted the research released recently by Toker Health Corporation (THC), Chef Greene has decided to incorporate cannabis into Ivar’s world-famous chowder pot. The cannabis seed is made up of approximately 35% (by weight) essential fatty acids (EFAs), which means it actually surpasses Ivar’s famously rich Yukon River king salmon in nutrient value. Further, the seed offers the exact proportions of Omega-6 and Omega-3 essential fatty acids (EFAs) based on the recommended dietary intake. According to Seattle nutritionist Anita Roach, RD, cannabis leaves, since they’ve only recently become legal to grow, haven’t been subjected to genetic modification, and thus retain more of the vitamins and minerals plants have when grown most naturally, and are thus more beneficial to our bodies. Greene has spent the past few months hashing out the best and tastiest way to substitute marijuana-infused oil for some of the fats in Ivar’s chowder, and deciding how to blitz each bowl with a sprinkling of fresh weed, rather than the traditional parsley.
&gt; 
&gt; Ultimately, Greene determined that, as with Ivar’s salmon and halibut, sourcing the best product possible would improve the taste of Ivar’s new chowder most. After testing dope products from around the state, Greene decided the grass was actually greenest if grown on the second floor of Ivar’s Acres of Clams location, which has a 420-square-foot south-facing test-grow room now fitted with greenhouse paneling to let in more sunlight. Beginning April 20, at the end of a public comment period, Ivar’s will begin a remodel of the entire secnd floor to establish a more extensive grow room—one ultimately capable of incorporating the ganja into all chowder currently sold in Washington. The new space will be powered by solar panels, to be installed as part of the remodel.
&gt; 
&gt; Today is the first day Ivar’s Acres of Clams will begin serving the new chowder, dubbed Ivar’s Super Mellow Chowder, using marijuana grown in the pier’s test-grow facility. Servers lit up when the management informed them of the switch, thrilled that they now have another way to help customers “Keep Clam.” Ivar’s fans are encouraged to get a bowl while it’s smoking hot, because supply will be limited until the remodel is complete.
&gt; 
&gt; The 20-day comment period for the proposed land use action opens today, April 1, 2015.
&gt; 
&gt; About Mary Jane Greene
&gt; Mary Jane Greene, head chowderhead at Pier 54’s Ivar’s Super Mellow Chowder, Inc., joined Ivar’s in 2000, when she felt other restaurant kitchen vibes got too stoked up when high order volumes left them in the weeds. Since then, she’s been one of Ivar’s chief innovators, and is currently moving forward with future menu changes. In 2015, her goals include designing a small kitchen-specific mechanical weed whacker that pulverizes pot into powders appropriate for stirring into tartar sauce and sprinkling on Ivar’s famous French fries. Outside the kitchen, she’s also a budding bird lover, and ultimately also wants to help the Pier’s seagulls keep clam, too.
&gt; 
&gt; Ivar’s DSA Review Request Verbiage
&gt; A Notice of Proposed Land Use Action has been posted outside Ivar’s on Pier 54. It shall report that the DSA is reviewing the following request by Ivar’s: 
To establish a cannabis grow farm on the second floor of Pier 54 for use in a recipe variation of the white clam chowder currently made by and served by Ivar’s Restaurants which shall contain up to but not exceed a legal amount of cannabis (pot, mary jane, weed, grass, ganga, dope, stink weed) both as an ingredient of the core recipe and as a garnish sprinkled atop the surface of the chowder.

"I had a dog for ten years that was downright VICIOUS with dogs she didn't know, and there was more than one instance where she drew blood on a leash less dog who ran up to us (friendly).

She was leash trained and was able to pass other restrained dogs with no issues, but there was pretty much nothing I could do in situations involving unleashed dogs.

If I saw the dog approaching early enough, I'd pick her up.  She wouldn't attack through me.  She was a 50lb staffordshire terrier mix, and often the other owner would laugh and say ""oh my dog is friendly, he wouldn't hurt her.""  And I'd respond with ""yea, well my dog isn't, and she'll rip your dog's face off.""

I warned my upstairs neighbors about letting their dog out unleashed in the fenceless yard (check to make sure I'm not outside with my dog, and I'll check to make sure you're not out with yours) but they still did it and we had a legit dog fight between their bulldog and my dog.  They came and apologized after that, despite their dog being injured.

It was so frustrating and I was always super vigilant when walking her because dummies think their dogs are better trained than they actually are.  If your dog will run away from your side when it gets distracted, then don't let it off its fucking leash.

I have the opposite problem now.. My dog is 10lbs and she loves other dogs but she gets timid around larger dogs at first.  We were at Lincoln park, and a collie and a golden retriever came running up, circling us.  Rue was terrified.  The dogs were adorable and friendly, but it didn't change the fact that my dog was uncomfortable, and their owners just watched the whole thing, half-heartedly calling them off.  It was really annoying.

Sorry for the rant.  Leash your dogs.",false,false,t1_cpwnenk,[deleted],,0,1427810954,t5_2qhad,t3_30w26n,t3_30w26n,27,1432115925,0,0,cpwnenk,Seattle,27,,
"New York, San Francisco, Portland, Chicago, Boston, Seattle... The list goes on and on. I know you all don't want to admit it, but there are consequences to higher taxes, more regulation, higher mandated costs, etc. I know of a number of business that employee a significant number of people in Seattle at middle class wages. Unfortunately, they are looking to automate or move out of the city entirely. The reason is that it is so expensive to do business here. 

They usually hire someone who has no skills, teach them a skill and increase their pay commensurately. However, they simply can't afford to pay someone who has absolutely no skills the new minimum wage, pay the associate LNI and ESD taxes, etc.

I know you all want to live in fantasy land, but it is simply true. I too am a small business owner and want to pay my people as much as I can. However, I wouldn't have been able to start my business in Seattle with a minimum wage of $15. Over the last few years, I have taught my employees new skills, shared with them more and more of the business and am paying them more because of these skills.

We will of course have more and more tech companies, which is great. Post-money of $6MM raised on a $5MM pre-money with $1MM raised is great, but it doesn't build a strong middle class.

"Hi, I'm the brewer responsible for the beers pictured above.  I think what's a shame is that our beer has to be categorized as ""gluten-free"", because I'd be brewing it this way even if celiac disease was eraducated tomorrow.  There's a lot of other good reasons to use alternative grains to make beer.  Flavor is one of them, but supporting greater biodiversity in our food systems is another, as is the fact that many of these grains grow well in climates not conducive to wheat and barley.  Millet requires far less water to cultivate than wheat or barley, and because it's not a commodity crop on the same scale, it's often grown with more sustainable agricultural practices.  We get our malts from a small dedicated malting operation, everything is malted and roasted by hand in small batches, and we can trace every batch back to a single farm.  It's not any harder to brew with these grains than it is to brew with barley from a technical standpoint, different for sure but with the right process it works just as well.  The main challenge is learning about their flavor profiles and how to combine them for greatest effect.  It's a fun challenge, and exciting to be on the cutting edge of brewing innovation.  It does sadden me to think we might get pigeon-holed as beer that only people with health concerns would drink, but we get a lot of customers who walk in without realizing we're 100% gluten-free...and many of them walk out none the wiser!  I hope more beer lovers will give us an honest chance and check their ideas about gluten-free beer at the door, because we're brewing beer for everyone, not just celiacs.  It's only going to get better as we continue to learn about these grains and dial in our recipes.",false,false,t1_cp1k6ks,igliashon,,0,1425273234,t5_2qhad,t3_2xkf1e,t3_2xkf1e,13,1427531237,0,0,cp1k6ks,Seattle,13,,

"I've found [nwasthma.com](http://www.nwasthma.com/pollen/pollen-count) to be very helpful for figuring out what I'm allergic to, and when it's high. Alder is giving me a ton of grief right now.

When things get bad, you need an antihistamine to stop your body from fighting the air.  There are a bunch of different types out there.  Some work better for some people than others.  It's possible to build up a tolerance over time, but one season is unlikely to cause that to happen.

Here are come common options for over the counter symptom control:

#Benadryl/Diphenhydramine
* Makes most people sleepy. You might have trouble becoming alert the next morning if you take one before bed.
* Usually good for 12 hours - check the box.

#Allegra/fexofenadine, Claritin/loratadine, and Zyrtec/cetirizine
* All of these used to be prescription only and have gone over the counter in the last decade or so.
* Non drowsy for most people. If you get the straight drug with no -D at the end, there usually isn't anything in there which will specifically keep you awake.

#Nasal sprays/rinses
I don't have any experience with over the counter nasal sprays, but I have used prescription ones. They'll make it easier to breathe by opening up your sinuses if you can inhale them well enough to get the mist up there.

Neti pots fall under rinses. There are also some squeeze bottle contraptions you can buy, but I have no idea if pressurizing water up into your sinuses is a good idea or not. Neti pots use gravity to physically remove mucus and snot from your sinuses and nose by flushing everything out with saline.  This works very well, but won't last as long as most of the medications listed above.

#Stinging nettles
[This one is not settled,](http://umm.edu/health/medical/altmed/herb/stinging-nettle) but I thought I'd include it here because they grow as weeds in the area.  You can get dried nettles at places that sell bulk herbs.

If you'd like to try it, make it into a tea.  I add it to my yerba mate, and either the steam or the nettles themselves provide some relief.  The relief doesn't last much longer than my mate does.

---

Of the medications I listed above (not the nettles or the saline rinses), the FDA has approved them for allergy use. That means that the generics will have the same active ingredient that the name brand does. Many pharmacies and Costco will sell bottles of 100-200 generic/store brand pills for a pretty reasonable cost once you figure out which meds work best for you.  

Talk to the pharmacist about dosages; it's safe to double up on some of these but not others.  Also mention any other medications or medical conditions you might have.  Check the directions for each, some work less well when you have juice or tea within a certain amount of time after taking them. Some types offer extended release and some don't.

Behind the counter, you'll find the decongestants if you are having a really bad congestion day. These contain controlled substances that you'll have to hand over your driver's license information to buy. Claritin D, for example, contains the same active ingredient found in Sudafed, which can be dangerous if you have a heart condition. Again, ask the pharmacist if these are safe for you if you want to consider taking them.  I'd suggest price checking the decongestant alone plus whatever you normally take against the combined form if you decide to go this route.

Pharmacists are a great resource for this sort of thing. They get training every year in how medications interact with each other and the body - it's always a good idea to check in with one before beginning a new medication.",false,false,t1_cpe7rau,tanglisha,Maple Leaf,0,1426291331,t5_2qhad,t3_2yyhxv,t3_2yyhxv,10,1427749772,0,0,cpe7rau,Seattle,10,,flair

Legality of homebrewing beer and wine has not had a negative effect on their retail markets (and may have a large positive  as nearly all new licensed breweries and wineries are started by people who began at home).

I'll admit though, that the current market for marijuana is different from the market for beer/wine, which is rarely bought illegally as there are few sources to do so and little profit to be made at that scale.  Whereas marijuana already has a very large and successful black market, actually enforcing existing laws would go a long way towards righting this.

I agree that fixing the tax structure of the current landscape would go a long way towards fixing any problems, but legalizing home growing probably won't have the level of impact you think it will.

Force = Mass * Acceleration

Assume:

* Dog = 60 lbs = 27.22 kg
* Speed = 30 mph = 13.41 m/s (meters / second)
* Time of deceleration of dog = .5 second

Acceleration = (13.41 m/s - 0 m/s) / .5 s = 26.82 m/s^2

Force = 26.82 m/s^2 * 27.22 kg = 730 Newtons of force

730 Newtons = **164 lbs of force**

They lost me in the first sentence. There isn't a single car-free city in the world today. There will never be a car free city so long as we have freedom and rich people have money they can choose to spend on not only cars, but politicians.

One problem I found with this piece is that it treats parking as if it is only for residents. I used to be, but now I only come in for business, and that requires a car because, as nice as transit is for regularly occurring visits, it is not good enough for what I do now (consulting and repair where I may need to get to a site NOW for an undetermined time from a random location). My clients pay a premium for my parking and I'm absolutely fine with that - it's a cost of the situation and cost of doing business downtown. 

However, as an outsider, it's harder to spend money because of the lack of parking.

"(In tech, and queer.)

It's more complicated than that if you're talking about /Queer Culture/ (capital Q, capital C), not as a catch all for ""all the gay folk"", but as a distinct cultural movement comprised of some LGBT-folk, which started in the late '80s/early '90s, and was a distinct reaction to a confluence of factors, such as the AIDS epidemic, the prevailing middle-classification (and in some ways gentrification) of the gay rights movement (and its focus on marriage, monogamy, and respectability as the Only Goals), etc. etc.

In that case, the 20 year old gay waiter is likely much closer to the people who started that (political and social) movement and the corresponding cultural scene than the 40 year old gay Microsoft PM.  Membership in Queer Culture in that sense is more than just being ""not straight/cis"", but also of similar intellectual, social, and political ideals, which are not necessarily aligned with (and often, in fact, opposed to) most middle class social and political ideals, particularly when it comes to issues like respectability politics.  (It is much easier to be a respectable gay in the eyes of US culture if you're well off, white, into one gender, into one partner at a time, and have a semi-traditional gender presentation.)

So in that sense, tech money, even gay tech money, often prices out the usually less affluent+respectable queers and ""kills queer culture.""  For my part, I'm acutely aware of the fact that I no longer resemble many people I was close to even just a few years ago--my concerns with respect to my job and life are on an entirely different track than most of the people I used to share a cultural, social, and political identity with.

Tech is becoming less homogeneous, and all in all that's probably a good thing, but it does mean that there are a lot of younger guys (think 23-28 age range) who maybe would have gone into finance, marketing, or accounting (and act like it), but who're in tech instead.",false,false,t1_cpe4jh3,electVolt,,0,1426285017,t5_2qhad,t3_2ywz28,t1_cpe0irh,21,1427747582,0,0,cpe4jh3,Seattle,21,,

"This requires some knowledge of the economics of how traffic works in the first place.

At any given time, if there's delay on a road, there is elasticity: there are some users who have already been 'priced' off the road - they travel at a different time, don't take the trip at all, use transit, or some other solution. That elasticity goes both ways; when an existing user chooses to do something else, like take better transit, another potential user who had switched to something else switches back to fill the space they left. A road like 405 is extremely saturated, so there are a lot of people who'll come back to using the road during peak time if a peak user leaves.

And that's just 405 itself. If you build a park and ride next to a train station at 405, not only will the same trips still exist on the feeder arterials, but the new user who's taking the space you made on 405 may actually increase congestion for everyone on that feeder!

There are also slower effects. If you make space and you run out of potential users, you open up demand for housing expansion, as you've created a subsidy to sprawl. Then the builders lobby, build more houses farther away, and bam, you've got more users and your delay is back.

The most risky place to smoke might be your hotel--if you have a non-smoking room, many of them make you sign a statement saying you understand that they will charge you (sometimes as much as $200 - $300) for smoking there--and some will do it, if they catch you.  So your best bet is to make some American friends with a home nearby, or get something you don't need to smoke, or smoke discreetly (edibles, or a JuJu Joint vaporizer), or go find a nice out-of-the-way corner of a park or a hiking trail (NOT in a national park--it's extra-illegal there).

"Case in point:

There is a man in my neighborhood with a bad reputation:  He is always out walking his gigantic pitbull that he has trained as an attack dog.  He carries a large metal rod and wears a body camera at all times.

I have see the man strike another (unleased) dog in the head with the metal rod when it came too close, drawing blood.  I have seen his dog break another (unleashed) dog's leg, quite viciously.  And, of course, I have seen hapless dog owners go off on him for his ""out of control"" dog, even though he is playing perfectly by the books.

The long and short of it is that he is 100% in the right.  If your unleashed dog gets its throat ripped out by his leashed pitbull, then it was your fault for not obeying leash-laws.  He also has every right to defend himself and his dog from other dogs, including literally killing your dog if need be.  He wears a body camera, so you have a 0% chance of getting anywhere in court over what happens if you were violating leash laws.

Regarding your dog:  I don't care if ""He's well behaved"", or ""He's a small dog"", or ""leashes are confining"".  If you have your dog off-leash, and you're not at a dog park, you're an asshole.

It's not just for your dog's sake either.  My dog is very well behaved and would never hurt another animal (she sleeps cuddled up with my cat).  However, nothing gets her more worked up than being antagonized by an off-leash dog while she is confined to a leash.  It seems that I can't even take her on a 10 minute walk without some other, usually larger dog, trying to ""play"" with her while she is on a leash.  It freaks her out badly, and there is nothing I can do about it but explain to the owner that leash-laws exist for a reason, and the rules apply to everyone.  Despite all the ""I'm sorrys"" that come out of them when it starts, It almost always ends with eye-rolling because, apparently, Seattle dog-owners think their dogs are people...  This is why I skip straight to taking pictures and calling the police now, because if a polite explanation won't sway you, maybe a $500 fine and the risk of having your dog taken away will.

Tl;Dr: If you disobey leash laws, anything that happens to your dog is your fault, even if another dog, or even a person, kills your dog.  Your dog isn't special, and neither are you.  Obey the law, and if you must, go to a goddamn off-leash area!

"Yes, and no.

Chicago is certainly much bigger, and less constrained by geography than Seattle.  You can get a single-family home in Edison Park, but you might as well live in Skokie at that point.  It also has neighborhoods that are much sketchier than anything you'll ever find here, and housing prices there figure into the median home price for the city.  You can get townhomes and single-family places for near Detroit prices in some of the worst ghettos out west or south.

But what's striking about Chicago is how well they do density, and what that means for affordable housing in almost **any** part of the city.  Chicago is absolutely packed with three-and-four story apartment buildings from the early 20th century, and lots and lots of these are now condos.  Most neighborhoods in Chicago look a lot like the denser parts of Capitol Hill, even the ritziest parts of the city.  Single-family homes exist, and some blocks are all single-family houses or brown/graystone rowhouses.  But even those neighborhoods are filled with apartments and condos.  Think of the area east of 15th, north of Mercer.  All those beautiful single-family neighborhoods of Craftsman and Tudors.  Every block in that area would need one or two four-story building with a dozen or two units mixed in to start approaching Chicago density.  Whole blocks of single-family houses would probably have to go.  But certainly not all of them.

What this mean is that you can buy a condo in a popular neighborhood like Lincoln Park for well under $200k.  Heck, you can buy a unit in a high-rise on the Gold Coast for under $200k.  In those same neighborhoods are condos and graystones that run well into the millions.

My favorite example is my old neighborhood, Hyde Park/Kenwood.  It's not the hippest part of town; more akin to West Seattle than Ballard or Capitol Hill.  It's quiet, but there's a nice neighborhood center with your good range of restaurants and shops.

You can buy a one-bedroom condo or coop in Hyde Park starting at around $100k.  

I just jumped on Redfin, and found this unit for sale.  4 bed, 2 bath, 2,200 square feet, for $209k:

https://www.redfin.com/IL/Chicago/1053-E-Hyde-Park-Blvd-60615/unit-2/home/12615423

That's a really friggin' nice place. Big, open, and airy with lots of light.  The unit is very nicely updated.  It's a great, tree-lined street; here's the Street View:

https://goo.gl/maps/YDR1Z

But quick, do a 180 on Street View.  That black Suburban belongs to your famous neighbor.  Obama lives, literally, three doors down.  His street is lined with multi-million dollar single family homes, the kind of thing you see on Millionaire's Row on Capitol Hill.  I don't think you'd have to worry about street crime in that area.

Parts of Capitol Hill kind of do this right.  Lower Queen Anne, too, maybe.  There's a real mix of housing units, from tiny efficiencies to big condos to single-family homes.

&gt;Satellite broadband is getting faster and more affordable, but it’s still significantly more expensive for someone who would be using the Internet both day and night for home and business.

So satellite might get TV and some Internet into Seth’s home, but not into his home office. Thus, strike ViaSat from the above list.**

This may have been the perfect solution for Seth — no need to run cables out to Comcast node; no waiting for CenturyLink to get around to providing service to his area — except StarTouch doesn’t actually cover his neighborhood.

Are we obligated to agree with Reifman that there's an issue with Seattle in order to comment? I can't disagree and believe that maybe the problem isn't with Seattle's dating scene?

"Wrong - that's a popular misconception about Singapore.  Chewing gum is actually legal there for medicinal use;  it simply needs to be purchased from a pharmacy under doctor's advice.  And the punishment for chewing gum-related offences - similar to spitting, littering, or failing to flush a public toilet - is a hefty fine, not caning.

Caning _is_ a punishment for more serious offences, of course.  The oft-cited case of the American Michael Fay, who received four strokes of a cane, resulted from a conviction for 50 counts of vandalism.  Other offences punishable by caning include hostage taking, robbery, molestation, and rape - a completely different tier of crime than chewing gum or spitting.

The confusion in the international community between chewing gum and caning may be historical:  the gum ban was originally instituted because people were intentionally vandalizing the door sensors on the subway with used chewing gum, causing costly repairs and system delays that inconvenienced many commuters.  That would reach the level of vandalism, of course, triggering the matching punishment.

I'm not saying Seattle should adopt similar policies, but it's important to have an accurate picture of how Singapore's system actually works to understand how it differs from ours.  For the majority of everyday crimes affecting public order there, the penalties are financial, not corporal.  

The takeaway for Seattle is that in other cities, cultural and financial deterrents can both be effective at preserving order in a downtown area;  we have neither in place, but we do have an opportunity to learn from successes elsewhere to find an approach that works for our own hometown.

&gt; Rich Chinese emigrants to US may be Trojan horses:
A new report shows that 64 percent of Chinese millionaires have either emigrated or plan to emigrate―taking their spending and fortunes with them. The United States is their favorite destination.
It is said that the main reasons rich Chinese are leaving is to pursue better educations for their kids, to escape the pollution and overcrowding in urban China and to protect their fortunes.
But, the emigration of rich Chinese may be a systematic one with a certain malice trap backed by Chinese communist party.
It is well known that China has the ambition of the world conquest inspired by a dream of Mao Zedong.
For that goal, China must conquer the United States first.
Not by military power, but by a slick trap.
The simplest method to accomplish the purpose is to make a Chinese American the US President.
The rich Chinese who had immigrated to the United States will provide an infinite fund for a presidential election.
If the Chinese American President will be born, he will let the American economic and military power weak rapidly. American military and industrial information will leak out to China freely. Chinese emigration to the United States may increase explosively.
The United States will be taken over in this way by Chinese emigrants.
As for the stupid American, nobody notices this trap of China.

"Cops and/or city policies don't do anything to stop this crap.

My business just moved from SODO this past weekend. At the SODO location we had multiple campers (actual motor homes) park across the street. Their was obvious drug dealing/usage going on. One of them essentially used their side window as a pharmacy window. Seen dozens of people piss/shit on the ground (on a few occasions there were shits on our property). But aside from the drugs and fecal matter, the garbage is the worst. It's everywhere. And when the people are eventually evicted from the area, they leave tons of garbage and it sits there for weeks. 

I have spoken to officers on plenty occasions about it, and all they say it ""Yeah I know, but we can't do anything about it""

One time the officer said the only thing I could do was call some city agency to report vehicles being parked for more than 72 hours. Then a week later the motor homes are tagged to moved. So they all move somewhere else and do the exact same thing.

Worst thing is, they would always end up back across the street. It's just a cycle.

I went back to our old store a couple days ago (The new owners haven't moved in yet) and one of the motor homes was actually in our parking lot now, instead of across the street. With obvious drug traffic going on while I am parked right there.

Oh, and the other thing I have noticed more and more, is the homeless/drug addicts that seem to just cross streets whenever and wherever they want. Last week a guy started walking across 4th Ave S while traffic was moving in both directions, and he just gave every car the finger as he forced them to slam on their brakes.

"Pro-tip for dealing with OCD while on reddit:

*The impact comments and imaginary points on the Internet have on your life is exactly up to you.*

This is /r/Seattle, everyone gets downvoted at some point. Even if your comment cured cancer, somebody would downvote it.

Take a breath, go outside, find some people with similar interests and go where they are. Do some of the same things with them. People don't make fast friends here, they seem to be in it for the long haul.

I've lived here for years and I've made some friends, but it wasn't overnight. The first few people I met and started hanging out with here, I no longer know them or speak to them. And there's no reason for it... at least that I could find. They just stopped calling and we gradually stopped hanging out. But when I finally *did* meet some true friends here, well they are now some of the closest friends *I have ever had,* perhaps even better than some of my childhood friends I've known my whole life.

You just have to get out there and find them.

Good luck.

Somebody mentions Prozac (and they weren't even critical of *you,* just Prozac!) and you respond with:

"Pffff, fuck yeah!  I've never really had a 'preferred airline' per se... I don't really travel enough to have a super strong opinion and made my decisions mostly on price.

So I went to your site, paid the price I saw when I was picking out my flight (a little more expensive, but at that point I was willing to pay to avoid the bait and switch), and that was that.

"This is solidly in the range of middle class. Maybe upper middle class, but I don't think so, not for a family of four.

Here's what middle class is to me:

* You aren't living paycheck to paycheck
* You own your own home, but probably have a substantial mortgage
* You have health insurance and are able to afford medical care
* You are able to accumulate retirement savings
* College is an option for your kids
* You can afford to live in a place that isn't crippled by endemic crime
* You have one car per working adult, and can afford to keep the cars fueled and maintained
* After all of these things, you have enough left over that you can take the family on a vacation every few years. But not to the French Riviera. We're talking the San Juans or, occasionally, Disneyland
* You have a career, not just a job

The difference between $125k and $80k here is retirement savings and paying down debt. At $125k, you might be able to retire at 65, while others making less are going to be working until 70. You might be driving a low-end BMW instead of a Camry, but otherwise the lifestyles are very similar.

Without knowing the methodology behind *how* they came up with the water costs, I've got two theories:

* We don't have ""a ton of fresh water."" In reality, we have two sources: The Upper Cedar River watershed and the Tolt River's Southern Fork watershed. Seattle is lucky in that we own the majority of those sources (the rest being owned by the Federal Government), and they are of exceptional quality. But, they're not massive or unlimited, and as the climate continues to change controlling water usage through rates will be critical to maintaining supply. Both of the water systems we have are rather old: The majority of our water comes from the Ceder River, and that was designed and built in the early 1900s. The Tolt River system came around in the late 50s and 1960s. Old systems are expensive to maintain, and require a lot of overhauls and renewal work to meet modern standards.

* Our sewage system is in the middle of a massive, very expensive overhaul. Sewage treatment is maintained by the County (since they absorbed Metro in the early 90s), but much of the infrastructure in the City is actually owned and maintained by SPU - and we pay for both through our water bills. Both sides of that jurisdiction line are having to implement massive retrofits and redesigns of the system to meet EPA regulations regarding sewage treatment and handling. Those cost a lot of money.",false,false,t1_cpc1kgq,kd8drx,Columbia City,0,1426120348,t5_2qhad,t3_2yqhly,t3_2yqhly,21,1427710814,0,0,cpc1kgq,Seattle,21,,flair

"Doing some quick math, I am pretty sure this will end up being a decrease in pay for most servers. 

Under the old system, a server would make $9.47/hr plus tips. Tips would be roughly equal to 15% of their sales. So if a server has tables with checks equaling about $300 in a given hour, the tips on those bills would be about $45. So the total pay for that hour is about $55.

Under this system, let's say the server has customers who have ordered the same things, but now it is $360 because of the 20% increase. They made $15 in base wages, and now they get 8% of their sales as a commission. That would be $28.80. So under the new system, the server's take home is $43.80. That is a 20% decrease in earnings.

I think it is cool that Ivars is trying something new, but I think the servers are going to end up making less money in the next year than they did in the past year.

edit - messing with some different sales amounts to see where the $15+no tips is better

All amounts are for a single hour of pay plus tips/commission on a single hour of checks.

 Total checks in an hour | $9.47/hr+Tips | $15/hr+8% com on sales | % change
------------------------|-------------|----------------------|--------
$50 ($60) | $16.97 | $19.80 | +17%
$100 ($120) | $24.47 | $24.60 | +.5%
$150 ($180) | $31.97 | $29.40 | -8%
$200 ($240) | $39.47 | $34.20 | -13%

I do not know what an average hour in sales for a server is at Ivars, so it is possible that this would increase the pay for some people. But I think the busier shifts are likely to earn less money for the servers. As soon as the checks in a given hour surpass $100, the no tip system begins to lose money for the servers.

"&gt; ""American"" history is mandatory, there's no reason this should not be part of it.

How do you mean? The history of the state of Washington and the city of Seattle itself is intertwined very closely with native people to this very day. It's not just about pre-Colonial history, but includes many things that happened in and outside the city of Seattle. This includes the Treaties of Point Elliott, Medicine Creek, and Point No Point, to name a few. Other important historical events include the fish-ins at Frank's Landing, the Boldt Decision, Oliphant vs. Suquamish (hence WA being a PL 280 state), and more. And that just covers the legal side.

The cultural piece is also important because many times, our stories are often given little to no coverage unless in the context of Peter Puget or other people who came through the region from other parts of the world. We (myself included) as native people have had to play the role of historians and on-the-spot anthropologists our entire lives, whether willingly or not. This bill provides a means to make sweeping changes across the board, and to really broaden everyone's understanding of what happens outside of their door steps. Even better, this gives native people from the region a bigger voice in having their stories told on their own terms. While the article states that there is reluctance on the part of non-native teaching staff to teach this effectively, that will likely be the biggest barrier as far as I'm concerned. But that's what education is about!

"For those who are curious but haven't followed MLS, a summary based on my understanding -

MLS is single entity; the teams aren't separate companies. Player contracts are held by the league rather than teams. This is a big deal in soccer since the US is a small league in worldwide play. Its one of the only places where contracts are held by the league itself rather than the teams.

In addition, there is a highly restrictive salary cap for teams which keep pay for most players low. While teams have 30 active players sharing $3.1 million in salaries. They are allowed 3 players (DPs, or designated players) who can be paid with additional money that doesn't count towards this limit are paid beyond this. Ignoring the DPs, the average salary is ~$100k a year. Starting players may make as little as $36k.

Both of these are attempts by the league to avoid the fate of a previous incarnation without a cap or central player contract ownership. Teams bid against each other for players and without a cap a few teams with high budgets picked up all the talent effectively effectively killing competition and the league itself eventually.

As MLS has grown (including a more lucrative TV deal recently), players want a bigger share of the pie. Lack of free agency in particular is a massive sticking point for the players union. The fact that the league itself holds the contracts and can influence trades complicates the standard ideas about how free agency would work.

The collective bargaining agreement between the player union and the league expired and the attempts at renegotiation haven't gone well. This is particularly big deal because it is an expansion year for the league with a pair of new high profile teams joining the league, MLS getting air time in Europe, hope about riding an increase in interest post-World Cup, etc. A strike would be massive right now.

Teams would normally be traveling for their first season opening game on Thursday. The start of the season will likely be delayed if a contract isn't nailed down by then.",false,false,t1_cp36l5f,[deleted],,0,1425409229,t5_2qhad,t3_2xtawe,t3_2xtawe,27,1427559031,0,0,cp36l5f,Seattle,27,,

"Thank you so much! The views of downtown from hills looking down are remarkable because they predate I-5 cutting through. The second view appears to look down 7th Avenue toward the Roosevelt Hotel, I  guess from Spring Street, with Queen Anne in the background. 

The third is recognizably westbound on Spring between Seventh and Sixth because of two buildings: the white block looking tower at left is the federal courthouse, and the building with Spring Apt. Hotel painted along the top is now the Hotel Vintage Park. (My parents lived at the Spring Apt Hotel when they moved to Seattle so it's cool to see it as it was.)

The fourth view looks to be from Columbia at about Eighth or Ninth. The clue here is that rounded red roof of the Methodist church still on Fifth and Marion, with the red brick of the downtown YMCA behind it to the right. 

That first view took me a while, but the clue is the fancy Palomar sign all up the corner of the building on the right. This view is facing down University Street from Fourth about where Purple restaurant is today. The Palomar Theater was at Third and University until 1965. At left you can see the brick of the base of the Seattle Tower building, with a cool sign on top of the low building across the street beyond, where the 1201 Third tower is now. And past that you see the four-story Brooklyn Building, preserved as part of the 1201 Third complex. I work in an office in the Brooklyn.

"I thought his analysis of the problem was pretty accurate, if you discount the growth in housing wealth from overall economic/GDP growth the numbers look a lot less impressive than they do otherwise, and it seems likely that most of that growth was in the hands of people who were already quite well-off, and at the same time more and more of the less well-off population's money goes toward housing costs.

I fully disagree with his 100% supply-side view of what the solution to that problem should be. Although SF is a good example of an area where lack of supply and NIMBYism is having a noticeable impact on housing costs, it's completely disingenuous to ignore the impact the supply-side actors have on both prices and inequality by bidding up property/land values in a largely speculative manner, neglecting to build supply for low-to-middle class buyers/renters and evicting renters with astronomical rent increases in areas where non-housing-related economic growth has allowed them to do so. Better land-use/zoning is one part of the solution, but he really just came off like an industry shill by suggesting that simply removing regulation from the housing market will remedy this problem on its own. I think the blogger played up the pure supply-side argument a lot more than the author of the study itself did, though (it made no mention of NIMBYism or San Francisco, and only seemed to briefly mention regulation as a root cause of the problem, citing another study).",false,false,t1_cpsoqvh,animalchin99,,0,1427476123,t5_2qhad,t3_30hudn,t1_cpsnua6,11,1432047597,0,0,cpsoqvh,Seattle,11,,

"OP here. This is right outside my house. I see people who appear to be on drugs waking up and down Northgate all the time. There has been a big problem with people dumping garbage and using drugs in this area, especially over by disc golf course which is 2 blocks away from this corner.

I stumbled upon this whole walking to the Shell station at 10AM. At first I thought it was just ordinary garbage but upon further inspection it was loaded with hypodermic needles and drug baggies. 

I called 911, who directed me to the non-emergency line for SPD (206)-625-5011, who directed me to the Hazards Information Line (206)-587-3292, who directed me to the King County Household Hazardous Waste Facility (206)-263-3050, who directed me to the City of Seattle Illegal Dumping Hotline (206)-684-7587—all to no avail.

I the tried to phone the north precinct directly and was advised that I should just ""very carefully pick them up and put them in a cardboard box and throw them away."" 

Now I don't have to tell you that this is horrible advice, but just to be clear, this is hazardous medical sharps waste and one must assume that there may be deadly pathogens present. 

I'm at my wits end at this point—it's now 7PM and the cart is still there along with all of the needles—so I take a bunch of pictures and drive over to the North Precinct which is just a couple of blocks away. I'm intending on convincing an officer to come make a report and get the right people notified so that this gets cleaned up.

I get to the precinct, approach the window, and reception instructs me to use the phone to get a hold of 911 dispatch. LOL.

So I call 911...again...from the police station...

They ask me to wait at the police station for the officer. I tell them I only live a few blocks away. They ask me how long it will take me to get back to the location. I say 3 minutes.

Good thing I didn't wait there! The officer didn't show up until 11:30PM!

And guess what they said! ""Since we can't really price there's any narcotics here, there's nothing we can do. Usually if there's garbage dumped somewhere, someone will take responsibility for it and take care of it. Aside from that, I can call someone and try to get the appropriate people notified.""

A little later the officer calls me and tells me that he's asked the communication department to notify the Seattle health department response team to come clean it up. He didn't know if they have a 24 hour response team so if nothing has been done in the morning I should contact them myself.

So what's probably going to happen is I'm going to call them, they're not going to do anything about it, and I'm going to wind up cleaning it myself because I don't want the kids who live around here to get hurt. But this means that I'm putting myself at risk and the waste management crew at risk.

For anyone with a dog reading, please restrain them before you drive.  In addition to being safer during the crash for both the dog and the people the dog will hit (Kona looks to be about 60 pounds, in a 30 mph crash the fast and rough estimate of force is about 1800 pounds.  In a 60 mph crash that's 3600 pounds of force), having a dog restrained will keep them from running off scared when the crash is over.

"Everyone talking about Bill is, in some sense, talking about a red herring.  The point of the article isn't necessarily Bill himself, or the hypothetical solutions that he (as a person seemingly burdened with difficulties of mental illness and addiction) 'should' have been able to bootstrap himself into. The point is that there are few solutions right now. There may be thousands of Bills running around Seattle.
 
The article stipulated that 22,000 applicants sought 2,500 spots of low-income housing. Meanwhile, people are advocating simple density, as though without legislation to back up allotments for low-income housing the sheer number of units will magically solve the problem. Much like the labor problems this country is facing, we can't expect money-driven people or corporations to support our most vulnerable populations without pressure. We need to find a better system to help the Bills of Seattle that doesn't rely on individual charity or being one of the lucky few who can stick out the waiting list.

Because, being involved with a low-income housing organization, I know that one of the problems of a years-long waiting list for affordable housing is that lives change in the meantime. People get jobs. People lose jobs. And that change in salary can bump you off the waiting list entirely, meaning that you start over, even having been on the list for four or five years prior. And some of the requirements--like for many low-income services--can be ruthlessly low. There is a giant pool of individuals who are considered too wealthy for low-income assistance, but too impoverished to really make it in this Seattle. They may have jobs here. Families here. They may be so poor as to not even have money for real relocation.

"&gt; Just leave the forests alone.

People invest millions of dollars into them for resource purposes, research, wilderness, and multiple other objectives. There are also a lot of legal issues about fires from property owners where fires spread into other ownerships that are kind of important. I've worked in this field. The National Park Service doesn't take kindly to fires from other ownerships burning their land no matter how ""natural"" it is. 

&gt; Everyone in forestry is so confident that while all previous generations had terrible ideas about how to manage our forests and in fact did damage, they will be the first to get it right.

This would be like me saying all the environmental science people and ecologists I've worked with want to make sure we never have 1st world living standards again. Or that we should get rid of food farms since they're a permanent conversion of land and aren't natural. 

Sit in a meeting of foresters and then tell me they all believe in the same management goals. Now mix in industry, community groups, environmentalists, fisheries, tribes.... 

&gt; I don't buy it, just leave the forests alone and allow them to self correct.

Think whatever you want. In the mean time, people still need wood fiber and western forests are overstocked from a century of fire supression. I'd rather see it utilized than go up in the atmosphere. 2x4's are still a carbon sink. Unnatural forest fires are not. Better a thinning from below mimic a natural forest than the whole thing being burned to cinders in an unnatural crown fire.

&gt; So, yes, keep your ""beneficial chainsaws"" out of the national forests.

You don't understand why a community wants to have a say in its own future?

The people who came later have no regard or care for the generations of people, families, and communities that live there - the only ""right"" the latecomers have is their higher income. 

Do you really have that little regard and that much disrespect towards the community you've moved into? Are you that tone-deaf that you can't understand why its historic identity matters to people from there? 

You can move into whatever neighborhood you like, but coming in without any respect or regard for its historical communities and what they're facing is incredibly narcissistic and myopic.

"We HAD this until the mid 1990s.  Seattle Metro was a division of Seattle City government, not unlike City Light.

Some sort of fait accompli by King County moved it over to King County management.  Ron Sims and Gary Locke, if I'm remembering correctly, were the prime ones in favor, along with help from Norm Rice.  Crony government at its worst.

Ever since, King County has fucked Seattle hard on transit - we lose core city bus seats regularly, we lose routes that have worked and been used for years, and they overspend on stupid shit like half-empty 1-way buses back and forth from places like Issaquah and Woodinville, that Seattle taxes pay for but see little to no benefit from.  Seattle pays .. King County decides what to do with the money.  Usually this means ... more big spending on county projects, and cut more central city buses.

Seattle City Metro was great, buses often ran more on an 8-10 minute schedule and there were about twice the number of central city buses serving the city than there are now.  

And once these light rail extensions get built we'll have possibly made it all the way back to .... part of where we were all along with buses.  Regular 8-10 minute service (maybe) and a fast trip from central city neighborhoods (just not as many) to downtown.

Then there was  the express 194 from downtown tunnel to airport..  22 minutes, and it dropped you off in front of the airport.   Now using Link Light Rail?  50 minutes on the train, and you're dropped off about two city blocks away.  And the trip costs double.

Let me use myself as an example: I want to take the bus to work. I pay about $1600 a year for parking at work, but my company would pay for 100% of my public transit.  I WANT TO RIDE THE BUS.

In a car, my commute time is 12 minutes.  By bus, it is 52+ minutes with at least one transfer.  That is an unrealistic amount of time to go 4 MILES!!!.  I live 3 minutes from a park and ride. We have an utter failure of public transit that is disincentivizing people from riding the bus or nearly non existent light rail.

Tipping is also kind of an offensive practice if you stop and think about it. You, the customer, pretend to be some sort of wealthy patron. They, the person bringing the food, are cast in the role of servant. ""Keep at it old chum. I rate your performance at a 17% percent. Good, but could use improvement.""

Because so many people actually do *depend* on tips here, I *do* tip. But I walk in expecting to tack on a fixed gratuity at the generous end of customary, regardless of the level of service. Again, the philosophy here is that, if tips are a farce, *but they're needed by the workers*, I just factor it in. If something is horrible, I'll bring it to their attention, but I don't withhold tip as a general rule.

"It's an unusual neighborhood. There are lots of retirees and a significant influx of young people with families. And because of the commute, 520 tolls and its mostly decent access between downtown Seattle and the Eastside it may become a much more sought after place to live. There are clusters of extremely low income housing, apartments mostly, and then stretches of incredibly rich people along Lake Washington. The food scene is not really happening but does have a handful of good restaurants. Toyoda Sushi, Aloha Ramen, Thai One On, Kaffeeklatsch bakery and probably a few others. But aside from those businesses that have realized there is a customer base there willing to spend money (mostly those with views of Lake Washington), it can feel like a wasteland. It can be a pretty nostalgic neighborhood too. There is a guy that fixes watches, a travel agency and a community center out of the 60s. Some of the other businesses never left the 1970s. Occasionally it can feel like a time warp. The Elliott Bay Brewery moved in and seems to be packed almost every night. The Beer Authority is also a popular destination. And if you like weed, well, there is no shortage of medical and recreational pot there. The crime sucks, but it mostly just meth heads stealing mail, heroin addicts shooting up in the porta-potty at 125th and LCW and drunks fighting across from the old fire station. But there really isn't much violent crime. I've only heard of one shooting there, and it was the previously mentioned drunks fighting someone that had a gun. One of them was shot in the butt but was back on the street drinking a few weeks later. And despite the massive housing projects near 145th and LCW, the gang stuff is pretty low key. There is a new skate park going in and the elementary schools that were lost in the 70s are also getting building updates. But by far the loudest complaint from residents is the lack of sidewalks.

"The bigger problem is that Seattle gets some 60% of it's tax revenue back as from state spending. Yet, every homeless person in the state eventually comes to Seattle, because we have some amount of services.

Seattle spends a lot of money dealing with poor, drug-addicted, and homeless people. 

These people are not the enemy. Homelessness, drugs, and poverty are the enemy. The solution is NOT to stop services in the Seattle area (with a typically right-leaning philosophy of ""if you build it they will come""). The solution should be 2-part: 

1. Recognize the fact that the entire state contributes to Seattle's homeless population, and spend money accordingly. We should find some way to track where the homeless came from, and then charge that city.

"I disagree, and here's why:

&gt;That elasticity goes both ways; when an existing user chooses to do something else, like take better transit, another potential user who had switched to something else switches back to fill the space they left.

You are correct, there are indeed people who are ""priced out"" of the market when there is heavy traffic. But there is not a one-to-one replacement effect when someone switches from a traffic-filled road to public transport. If as many people would switch from not driving to driving in traffic as people who switched from driving in traffic to taking public transport, then that would mean that all of the replacements in traffic would all gain the same amount of utility from driving in the initial amount of traffic as the people who left it in the first place. Do you really think that they all gain the same amount of utility? Flat utility curves are extremely rare among diverse populations, and I think that here it is not the case as well.

&gt;If you build a park and ride next to a train station at 405, not only will the same trips still exist on the feeder arterials, but the new user who's taking the space you made on 405 may actually increase congestion for everyone on that feeder!

This is true. However, with proper infrastructure this can be limited. Also, just so we're clear, what you're saying that there would be more traffic around transit centers, as well as the same amount of traffic on 405. Do you see the flaw in that logic? And correct me if I'm wrong, but an increase in traffic near transit centers, as well as an increase in people using light rail while maintaining equal amounts of traffic on 405 would indicate that the **net** amount of ""new users"" would be going to the metro system: That's a good thing. We're satifying demand for a light rail, at minimum. However, if my version is correct instead of yours regarding the one-to-one substitution of drivers on 405, this would mean that there's a decrease in traffic on 405, with demand met for light rail expansion - Isn't that what we want?

&gt;There are also slower effects. If you make space and you run out of potential users, you open up demand for housing expansion, as you've created a subsidy to sprawl. 

I agree.

&gt;Then the builders lobby, build more houses farther away, and bam, you've got more users and your delay is back.

with this part, you're acting like those users appeared out of thin air! Those users would be somewhere in the system, just not in the same place.

When Nunavut became a territory we spent time learning about the Inuit too. It was FUN. I enjoyed it. I remember a good deal of it.

I wear headphones simply because it keeps people from trying to talk to me. A lot of creepy guys will try to talk to a woman who's by herself, and those conversations tend to get really uncomfortable really fast. However, I always either have no music playing or playing very quietly so I am fully aware of my surroundings.  
Even if raining I will not put on a hood. It eliminates your peripheral vision and makes it more difficult to hear what's going on around you.  
I keep my phone in my pocket unless needed. Dinking around on a phone is a quick way to make yourself a target.  
I get everything prepared before I leave whatever building I'm in (if I went to a movie or something) or before I get off the bus (if I'm transferring downtown), that way I don't have to open my purse/wallet while I am at a bus stop. Bus money/transfer in pocket, ready to go.  
I zip my purse closed and keep at least one hand on it at all times.  Always walk and stand with confidence. Walk with purpose and look straight ahead (or around you). Never walk looking at your feet or slouching.

"&gt; I love most of the plan, but it just seems incredibly stubborn of Murray not to include plans to expand roads. The last thing we need in Seattle is less car lanes and less room for parking.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induced_demand

&gt; I know that in an ideal world everyone would be able to bike and ride the bus to work, but realistically not everyone can do so. I know for myself, I couldn't take a bus even if I wanted to because I have to drive from courthouse to courthouse.

Thats a very nice story about you, now I could add a contrary story, using similar (but opposite) binary thinking but instead I will mention that you actually don't need everyone to ride a bike or take the bus to have a measurable effect on easing existing traffic. ""one less car"" isn't just a catchy meme, its literally what happens when you provide options that people use to stop driving.

&gt; Similarly, I don't think that the current bike lanes have come close to being at capacity. I've driven during rush hour on Second Ave and I saw a total of about 5 bike on the fancy new bike lane.

See above. Everytime the city asks, or transportation groups ask people in the city they say they would ride more, but they feel infrastructure is lacking.

According to this survey form a couple days ago, only 31% of commuters drive alone. I doubt cars only consume 31% of funding. ( its more like 99.9% )

&gt; Moreover, I don't really feel like Seattle is a year around bike town. For a good part of the year it is pretty wet and slippery outside.

dude, no one is forcing you to ride a bike.

&gt; Don't even get me started on how awful the parking already is. Why remove needed parking spots?

Because there is too much parking available.
 http://www.seattlebikeblog.com/2015/02/19/yes-seattle-has-a-parking-problem-theres-way-too-much-of-it/

"I've felt it a little interesting that all of the highrises going up were apartments and not condos, but then it does make sense. Another thing to factor in is that an apartment building can easily be converted to a condominium down the road, and a lot of the highrises going up seem to have all of the amenities you'd expect in a condo building if it boiled down to it; so I wouldn't be surprised if this is in store for the future.

Risk seems to be the word of the day in that article, and it's definitely a legitimate factor. Seattle is a boom town, and it's bringing a lot of green card holders to the city. We also have a plethora of college students and younger working professionals who may have good salaries but not good enough to afford a $1/2 million condo, or money aside, aren't yet ready to own real estate and are more comfortable renting. I definitely don't see a market for condos downtown, and I really wonder how much success Insignia is going to have selling all of their units.

It also makes me wonder if companies investing in the real estate market downtown don't have faith in the tech industry. Mark Cuban recently remarked how big the tech bubble is right now, and I'm sure insecurities like that are leading to developers only willing to put up cheap housing for rent rather than expensive housing for sale that might have to be foreclosed on in the next 5-10 years.

"The idea that many people have that tipping is even a half-way decent method of ensuring good service is just silly to me.

In a perfect scenario, I get amazing service, and social etiquette would then have me tip my maximum amount. 

In the worst scenario, I get horrible service, and social etiquette would then have me tip my minimum amount. From what I understand the reasoning would be is at the end of the day I still got served, and should pay an extra sum of money because of this.

So as a server the idea of being tipped is no longer a reward for doing a good job, it is an expected sum of money. Should I feel like phoning it in, I would still expect a small sum of money.

Then there is the idea that the sum of money the patron should tip, is reflective on the amount of money being spent. Again, its simply asinine . Should a server bring me a side salad and a water, or a steak and a whisky, the amount of work outputted by the server is roughly equal.

The only reasoning I can see from the comments in this post, are that some people are going to make less money under a system where the server is paid a higher base rate, and then possibly makes a commission of sales.  Well keeping the broken system, simply because it will mean less money for some, is definitely not a reason to keep it. The fact that a server can make $60,000 a year or more, to me just seems silly. That amount of money seems incredibly high, I would love to see how that amount looks against people in other industries. I mean while serving is stressful, and hard, and fast paced and all that, it is something the average person can do. It is something that someone with no other qualifications can get in to, and be good at just by working harder at. This is no reason to keep a system as it is. 

Treating a server as if they were any other worker in any other industry is the best way to ensure they do their job properly. If someone is not doing their job properly, they get a review from a superior. Then a set of expectations are laid out, and the server tries to meet them. If they can't then they are reprimanded, or fired, or demoted or something similar. The job is no longer dictated by an expectation of some moneys at the end of the table they are helping, the job is dictated by industry standards, customer satisfaction , proper management, etc. 

I know people are going to look at this and tare it apart. I know people are going to say stuff like ""what are people without qualifications going to do then"", ""tipping is a tradition"", or some other horrible way of supporting their stance, but at the end of the day tipping is stupid. Why is it that a couple will go into a restaurant and drop $50 dollars on dinner and then drop another $10 on a tip. Then the same couple will go  to Home Depot and buy $1000 in paving stones, and have some worker hand load them into their vehicle with no tip. Or they will go to a shoe store and have the associate running back and forth for an hour getting new sizes and styles, then spend $150 and not tip. Or they will go to any number of other places where they are being ""served"" but because social etiquette does not dictate, they do not tip.

The fact is that the social norms and general expectation are what keep this terrible system alive. It should be abolished, and banned, and tossed away forever.

That is pretty much unfeasible.

What **does** work, is a priori reasoning. That is to say, our starting point isn't econometric data. Instead, we start by imagining a model of some kind, perhaps a large scale macroeconomic model, or a model of how economic actors behave, and we try to make that model both as robust and as applicable as possible, and then we use that model to make predictions, and we evaluate that model based on the accuracy of those predictions.

When the app is on but there is no passenger, according to Uber, only the driver's personal insurance coverage is in effect.  This has led to personal insurance companies denying claims from UberX drivers who are in accidents while ""on the job"" but not currently carrying passengers.  Uber isn't paying for it, the driver's personal insurance company isn't paying for it (because the UberX drivers are not using their vehicles for personal use), so the UberX drivers are stuck with the expensive medical and auto bills.


The gist of the legislation is making Uber's insurance coverage be in effect during that ""gap"" when an UberX driver is on the job but isn't currently carrying a passenger.

This ""gap"" in coverage has become the center of the insurance debate, especially after an Uber Driver hit and killed a little girl in San Francisco.  The  Uber driver had the driving app ""on"" but wasn't carrying a passenger at the time, so Uber is denying the claim brought forth by the victim's family.

This legislation will force Uber's insurance to cover that gap, and that is why Uber is fighting this.  This legislation is basically a copy of the statewide legislation California passed last year.

*2. This legislation does not address personal insurance.

*3. California's legislation goes into effect on July 1st I believe.  You might see a little higher UberX prices as a result (I have my doubts about that though), but insurance coverage with no gaps will be better for Uber drivers, non-uber drivers, customers, and bicyclists/pedestrians.  

The end result is Uber will pay a little more for their insurance.

”Before the class begins, you must get on your knees and worship Strong and accept that she was the most highly-evolved being the world has ever known, even greater than Bezos!”

At this moment, a brave, fraternity associated, out-of-state Amazon tech bro who had written 15 billion lines of code and understood the necessity of gentrification and fully supported all Tim Eyman initiatives stood up and held a rock.

”When did this rock arrive here, pinhead?”

”Wrong. It got here in two days. If it's 4.6 billion years old and unions, as you say, are real… then it should still be at the warehouse.”

He wished so much that he had a gun to shoot himself from embarrassment, but he himself had petitioned against them in I-591!

"Russian politics has always fascinated me.  They've been a country (in a modern sense) for almost 500 years now, and they've never really had a ruler who was both competent and sane.  They've had effective leaders, and they've had benevolent leaders, but never someone who was both.  

Russia has had a fair number of leaders who truly did try to improve things.  There were people like Alexander II, who freed the serfs and reformed a lot of the relations between the Tsardom and the people, but he was also not a very effective leader.  He had trouble controlling the outlying territories, which led to him being brutally repressive of all political dissent, to the point where he eventually got assassinated by leftists.  Nicholas II was a pretty benevolent leader, but he could never get the people to like or respect him, and eventually ran into the dude with the bloody hands up above.  Yeltsin did seem to try to improve things, but he got fucked economically and really did a poor job with the transition to a capitalist state and trying to control the Russian mafia.  

Then you have the competent leaders, who also happened to be murderous psychopaths.  People who ran the country quite efficiently, but did so through brutality, oppression and violence.  Ivan the Terrible created the idea of Russia, but he built it on the corpses of thousands.  He brought the Moscovites to the table of diplomacy and built a nation around them, but he was also crazy enough that he killed his favored son and left the country to his mildly retarded other son.  Peter the Great reformed the aristocracy and turned Russia into a world power, but he would also force preteen boys to reenact famous battles, killing each other for his amusement.  Catherine the Great made Russia into an actual empire, and presided over what many people consider to be Russia's ""golden age,"" but she did it by invading countries right and left.  Lenin and Stalin forced Russia onto the global stage, and made it arguably the most powerful country in the world, but man did they [like to kill people](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Lenin#Red_Terror).  Like, [a lot of people](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin#Calculating_the_number_of_victims).  

I hate to say it, but Putin is one of the best leaders they've ever had.  He hugely built the Russian economy, until the Saudis started to fuck them last year.  He's built a decent cult of personality around himself, and a lot of Russians absolutely adore him.  Russia is still probably the second-most powerful country in the world (I'd consider them more powerful than China, just because they have so many more nukes).  And he's done this with only invading two sovereign nations and killing/imprisoning a few dozen political dissidents.  It's fucked up, but he has a pretty good track record, compared to the others.

"I learned some very helpful things this morning. I am still attempting to deconstruct the logic behind them but I have them on good authority:

* As a cyclist, it is my problem if someone decides to park in the bike lane
* If I don't like it when drivers park in the bike lane, I need to go to therapy
* Perhaps the reason drivers park in bike lanes is because I run red lights (I can't remember running any red lights, but it must be true)
* I personally am the one sole reason why drivers don't like cyclists (this is *great* news, because it makes solving our public conversation about cars+bikes *much* easier!)
* Parking in bike lanes is actually an act of support for cyclists
* Because the weather is nice, it's OK to ignore parking laws (still trying to find that SMC)
* Ignorance of the law is an excuse

"Macy's is the best. Although the facilities are basic, if you consider all facets of a positive bathroom experience, it is nearly unmatched. I offer the following credentials for your consideration:

* **Conveniently Located:** Macy's is located in the heart of downtown Seattle with access points from 3rd Ave, 4th Ave, and Pine Street. Reachable from dozens of major bus lines, the building is easy to spot by locals and tourists alike.

* **Anonymous:** Unlike hotel concierges and restaurant hostesses who incessantly want to ""help you,"" Macy's bottom-floor personnel is not concerned with your needs. Until you cross the invisible barrier delineating their makeup counter or shoe zone, you may walk to the escalator unmolested.

* **Private:** Tucked away on the third floor past the fitting rooms, its understated signage reads ""Ladies Lounge."" Half the people in the store don't know what that is; all the men assume it's another fitting room. But the discreet nature of this lavatory does not end here. The left row of stalls each have their own mirror and sink! Whatever you need to do, rest assured you can do it uninterrupted. 

* **Spacious:** If you wish to do your hair and makeup for all the other shift-workers and trophy-wives to see, a palatial foyer awaits you. Lighted mirrors, electrical outlets, and ample counter space line the perimeter of this clean but dated dressing room. Want somewhere to just chill and play Candy Crush? Have a seat on one of the tastefully appointed couches.

* **Cost-Effective:** Unlike stopping into a cafe or restaurant, visiting the bathroom at Macy's doesn't have to put a dent in your wallet. You will be free from exposure to offensive remarks, such as ""Paying customers only!"" and ""Not a public restroom!"" and ""Stop clogging our toilet!"" You may choose to shop for home items, handbags, and overpriced chocolate after your trip to the lavatory, but you don't *have* to. That's the Macy's difference.

I hope these talking points will assist you in making smart decisions about public restrooms for you and your family.

"Ugh...I'm so sorry you had to deal with that! I was actually hit at 5th and Pike right before this accident by a driver going the wrong way down Pike. He fled the scene, leaving me with a totaled car. Unfortunately, there was nothing that could be done since no one got a license plate number or anything so I went through my insurance and got a new car and two weeks later the side swipe happened. It was two days before Christmas and this was my brand new car so of course I broke down in tears as soon as it happened. Babbling female = wrong doing, apparently. 

I was incredibly persistent. I got a statement from the officer who witnessed the accident plus his card (he said he would testify on my behalf if it went to court). I then went to work and immediately jumped online to find traffic cam footage of the area so I could print off pictures of the scene (showing the construction, weather, where the officer was standing, etc) and include with my statement. I even drew out the street and lanes so I could remember down the road how everything was set up. On the back of the ticket there are instructions on how to contest a ticket so I followed those channels. Then I just had to wait for my court date. I got a hold of the officer who witnessed and told him the date and he showed up offering testimony that it wasn't my fault. I also submitted the pictures and my crude drawing of the street.

I 100% believe the officer that ended up writing the ticket just saw me as another woman who was in hysterics and doesn't know how to drive so gave me the ticket since the other driver was an older man (who also admitted he MAY have swerved into my lane to avoid the cones). My advice is to anyone is to be persistent. I couldn't afford to fix my car and KNEW it wasn't my fault so I didn't give up even though it took 6 months. Many instances bank on the fact that most people won't pursue justice because it's such a hassle but it was totally worth it in the end.

"Not particularly true, what you try to paint since the data is skewed. It's easy to point at data without any context.

Not to mention the fallacy you present is that if we get a state income tax -- the outcome is that other taxes will go away or be reduced to help alleviate the regressiveness. To boot, there will be no loopholes. As well as we'll heave a more healthy budget.

I have less than 30% confidence in saying that if we get a state income tax that other taxes will be reduced, and have even less in considering if there would be no loop holes.

So let me ask you, would you be in favor of reducing property taxes then? There was projected [$386 million generated in revenue on property taxes, ala 2013](http://www.seattle.gov/parks/legacy/files/taxes_taxrates_levies_101.pdf). With property values increasing, and there is talk to increase property taxes... which in your data scheme would be regressive. We *should* decrease those property taxes. No?

When the fact of the matter is that a majority of those living there are students... who make low-income wages due to their lack of degree, time commitment to school leaves them working PT or not at all, and a lot are on grant/scholarship/loan money. The other people living here are Amazon workers, and some tend to room together skewing the data -- get two or three guys making $70-90k in one house, it's lumped together as $180k income.

There's a lot of context missing is what I've pointed out. It's easy to wave numbers without context.

Non-profits are a great replacement for government run public goods, and services. The people who help out with [Operation Sack Lunch](http://www.oslserves.org/index.php) have the homeless eating far better than the kids eating those public meals in schools, or the elderly with their hot meals through the state. Heck, when I help out with OSL on Tuesdays and Fridays, I can't help but feel jealous sometimes because they eat better than I do. Even when I deliver food to kids through the University District's FB Pack for Kids, I see these kids having really awesome lunches for the weekend.

The best stories are through the non-profits who do help lift people off their feet. Heck, [FareStart](http://www.farestart.org/) does a fantastic job at this. It's not merely giving the homeless cash or food and let them be on their way. The connections made through to genuinely help them get off their feet is astounding compared to the public services which is kind of, ""Here's some pamphlets. Fill this form out, we'll interview you, and we'll send you a card in a few weeks if you qualify.""

It's like you just walk into a food bank in the University District without the need through layers of bureaucracy. A person who genuinely needs food can get a really nice variety of healthy and nutritious groceries without much hassle.

That doesn't mean that there are no excellent Mexican restaurants (I love Chukis and some other places), but it's easy for a mediocre or downright bad Mexican restaurant to stay open and get good word of mouth. However, it might still be more 'authentic' (i.e. closer to what people eat in Mexico) than Austin's Tex-Mex.

However, that 5% of unfriendly motorists are a GODDAMN VOCAL minority, and often act mind-bogglingly aggressively and dangerously.

Add to that the fact that this minority is EXCESSIVELY vocal, often monopolizing city infrastructure planning discussion - our only viable option to counter their effect is to be vocal in opposition, constantly supplying a neverending stream of data, studies, and evidence.

Don't like hearing cyclists talk about infrastructure so much?  Stand with us against those idiots and we won't have the NEED to be so vocal.

Around this time of month (the 15-20th) pre-inspections are done and their is enough time to notify the tenant their unit may be shown before they move out the 30th.  Then the apartment has some turnaround time after the 1st.

Basically a leasing agent does a month cycle of rent roll, rehab, marketing, showing, leasing, rinse and repeat.  That's why you should always look for apartments this time of the month (10th-20th).

The rents will rise for another five or so years, reaching astronomical rates for a city that isn't NYC and doesn't have real separate-grade mass transit. People will be kicked out, and slowly the place will devolve, those left will become even more insular, making a point of not letting anyone know their hangouts so those spots aren't sullied, those places will go out of buisness.

"This comment is ridiculous. 

There are buildings all over this city much older than that with almost no engineering compared to what went into this and those never even had an expected life span. 

I'm a civil engineer that has done some research on this building and the only thing that could become obsolete is the software which runs the temperature regulation systems in this building but that is easy to upgrade.  

Building structural systems don't really become obsolete since they are still doing their job holding up the building just fine, another building with some new innovation might be built somewhere else though, that happens everyday. 
solar panels become obsolete?  Replace them with a newer version. 
The toilets are composting.
 Composting still hasn't been made obsolete in thousands of years. The heat and cooling come from geothermal wells, the earth acts as a both a heat source and heat sink, I don't see the planet becoming obsolete before the building does.

Civil firms such as FDH who designed this building and specified down to the allowable percentage of lead that was in the sprinkler head system to the manufacturers who made custom parts (desks, wall finishes, waterproofing membranes) all of it is custom, engineered and built it out to anyone's highest standard know how to estimate building life spans,  and that is with a conservative life span,  engineers don't usually like to underestimate that kind of thing.

They also created an open to the public materials library from all the research that went into this project so that future projects that want to follow suit will be less expensive to build. A HUGE part of the budget was research and development but the group that is responsible for this project considers it [rightfully so] a trail blazing project and it is part of their mission to reduce the cost of this type of building which is why they were willing to spend the $ to make it a reality.

Please tell me about what it is you see about this project which would lead it's board (who's offices are in the building) to tear down this inspirational project which no one else has been willing to put the kind of money into up until now rather than it becoming building legacy and a proven concept of idea which will pave the way for other similar projects.

It's already outperforming its goals,  it will outperform its life expectancy and if the building systems are upgraded in the future that will really only make it even better.

Believe it or not, there are still police and fire services in unincorporated areas, LOL. They are still part of the United States, and you still have to pay taxes and the Constitution and the rule of law still applies, even though some right-wing fundies like to think otherwise.

It is remarkable how similar far right-wingers are with the way-left liberals. Both want to restrict freedoms to reinforce their holiness structures. 

The fact remains... there are plenty of florists. There are plenty of discriminating people. Should a gay florist have the right to refuse service to an anti-gay fundie? YES. Should the opposite be allowed. YES. That's life. There are people you disagree with, and its best to just live with it and move on. Best to avoid the holiness competition.

I’ve become a better listener. I make time for people and I try to stay playful. But in Seattle, none of this has translated into deeper friendships or meaningful romance.

It's true there are a lot of men here now due to the tech industry, but that's competition for you. You're aging and trying to meet your wife/life partner through Tinder in a city that has a surplus of men. Maybe you should have wrapped up this issue a decade ago.

"Frankly the issue with people doing that (and this is universal, it happens down in Portland too and pretty much every other city) is that the Police will send Parking Enforcement who usually do not arrive in time to ticket the driver. If no one stops to explain it they literally will do it *over and over* until someone tells them or they finally get hit with a ticket.

As someone who used to have to enforce parking regulations for a private entity that paid for spots on street (and off) I would constantly call the city; it's a god damn cluster. I also frequently would try and explain to drivers when I encountered them why I was calling the city and people would most frequently freak the f**k out and use a series of expletives. Rarely did people do the sheepish ""oh I didn't see that"" and move. On the plus side I got to know some of the enforcement guys and they would sometimes come to my aid with tickets in those more aggravating situations. 

I think once did I start an argument as I was on the clock and wearing logo apparel it's a bad idea to be unprofessional even when someone else is being a DB. Calling the cops doesn't do as much as people hope because in theory they are dealing with real issues.

Once I did have a cop show up instead of a Parking Enforcement Officer and he was rude to me for calling him asking if it was ""really a problem"" and why I ""didn't just call the tow truck myself"" (which, legally, for a city owned space I could not do and a truck couldn't pick it up without the city authorization).

A plate of undercooked cod which previously cost $11.50 ($10 including 15% tip to the server who then typically gives a percentage to the kitchen and floor support staff) now costs $12, of which the entire added 20% goes to the corporation to be disbursed as they see fit.

These things are actually more profitable for the company to pay for instead of splitting it all up magically, it's a good little tool to increase retention and attract talent.

"Portland feels your pain. Our downtown has quite similar problems. We have amazing greenspace around the river that has become the turf of bike thieves, heroin addicts, homeless campers, thugs, and meth-heads to openly engage in their behavior. The city does little to stem the problem because of the obsession with consensus and making sure nobody is offended and nobody's fee-fees get hurt.

Like you, we benefit from being a progressive city, but have a small contingent of extreme leftists with their heads in the sand - everyone described above are holy to them, and they must be displayed up front to demonstrate how awful capitalism is, and anyone taking issue with these worsening quality of life issues are literally Hitler. We have a homeless activist as our parks commissioner - permanent vagrant camps in parks are now the norm. While we have a generous plan to end homelessness, the passive attitude toward bad behavior leaves us with more and more homeless and junkies coming here to take advantage of what is essentially a free-love approach to our problems.

Unlike you, we're all income tax, which is just as bad as all sales tax. Any time the economy goes south, revenues plunge harder than any other state, so the increase in people in need get met with fewer resources than in good times.  But we're also saddled with multiple ballot initiatives that hamstring effective government services.

I would never live in downtown Portland for the similar reasons - I don't want to deal with sidewalk-shitters, junkies, and homeless camps that double as stolen bike chop shops - all of this right out in the open and deliberately not addressed.

"Not particularly.

Pertaining to this article, a lot of the early 20s and 30s in Seattle prefer to live in apartments, or rented out condominiums. I remember a thread awhile ago when people were debating owning vs renting, and a lot of people just heavily preferred renting since they want the flexibility to move if they need to. Only those who were on a family commitment wanted to buy.

The regressive tax system, as I've pointed out many times, is skewed a bit due to sin taxes such as alcohol and liquor, tobacco, etc. A good picture isn't painted unless you talk about specific taxes. Liquor for example has 20.5% tax, plus a $3.7708 per liter tax. Nearly a 50% tax for that. Cigarettes and other tobacco products as well, and possibly soon vaporizers. Marijuana is taxed heavily too.

As a person who works on a constant basis with non-profits either volunteering my time for their projects, or interfacing with the needy it's something that isn't written about. We have a really good non-profit support system here in Seattle.

Seattle like any other large city is growing. We're growing into a services type city -- one that requires highly skilled labor, and deep knowledge. We simply don't have the culture of jobs that cater particularly to both sides equally. It's heavily skewed.

A particular thing that skews data as well is due to the universities and colleges we have in Capitol Hill, University District, etc. These students are obviously low income without a degree, and also mostly living off of student loans, grants &amp; scholarships, or work study. So we need to look at this kind of data as well.

Moral of the story... it's really easy to paint pictures, and a story. However, when we dig into the depths of it there is a lot of data to really consider.

This is not to say there are poor people, and that they are suffering. It's incredibly sad when I help the homeless, or feed the needy. There just is a lack of jobs for them because of what kind of culture we've developed here.

The site came about because I was trying to imagine what life was like around here (Seattle) circa 1800, knowing that the first people were about the only ones living in this area at that time. I've always been oriented toward cartography and the question, ""Where?"", and found no maps or resources to easily satisfy my curiosity about where the people lived. I had a background in scholarly research but this was totally on my own dime (in fact, a whole lot of dimes for making a bank box full of copies), and a lot of time. I spent most of it in Special Collections at Suzzallo library at UWash. I met with several local Indian leaders and got their useful advice and grudging acceptance (there was, and still is, a lot of politics involved). I got permission from a mapmaker to adapt his landform map, and learned enough Photoshop to accomplish that goal after scanning the large original, which was expensive back then. WYSIWYG software allowed me to create the website, which I have been supporting to the tune of about $150 a year since the millennium. I'm retired now and would like to find a sponsor to cover the cost and keep ads off the site, so if you or anyone you know, etc. Still, it's been totally worth the time and money for the eye-opening appreciation coastsalishmap.org has sporadically attracted over the years.

"Just putting this out there, but this is essentially just a mandatory tip already included in the price. The restaurant is not going to have items priced 21% higher. So now regardless of service you are going to be paying that additional 21%. Additionally, assuming servers made between 18-20% tips before (standard for a higher end place) they will overall be making less money when all is said and done. 

This is a great move for the restaurant, great PR and increase in sales with higher labor expenses. But don't think for a second they made it because they wanted to pay more money to their employees. 

It's great for lower support staff and having a higher hourly wage will create more of a safety net for servers it's also not going to attract the best caliber people who can make more on the traditional tip system. 

It's also going to at a glance, make this restaurant much more expensive than its competition. 

And lastly, you can't not pay it for bad service.

"Here are some details:

First:
&gt; The new Code changes are intended to improve competition and customer service by eliminating cable franchise districts in favor of a more flexible provision that opens the entire City to competition.

During the birth of cable TV, cable companies were afraid they'd invest a lot of money pulling cable out to every home, only to then have some other company also do it, thus cutting into their revenues. Cities were afraid companies would only choose to serve profitable neighborhoods. As a compromise, cities created cable franchise districts, where the cable company was required to serve every resident, but where one cable company could operate.

Because of this, in some (most) parts of Seattle, you can only get Comcast. In some parts you can only get Wave. 

**Today's code amendment removes the cable franchise districts, allowing a cable company to obtain a franchise to provide service in any portion of the city or in the entire city** 

There aren't any details on how many competitors there will be. Presumably the city could remove the districts, and then only award a single franchise to Comcast. I don't believe that's their intention, but exactly how this will affect the state of cable services in Seattle is not entirely known.

Secondly:
&gt;  The Code also contains new requirements to ensure equity and build-out service to low-income households, enhanced call answering standards and reporting, and more flexibility and protections for residents and owners living in condos and apartments.

Since cable companies will be able to serve as much or as little of the city as they like, this create rules that prevents the cable operators from only choosing to serve rich neighborhoods. A ""significant portion"" of the households a cable company serves will have to be households that fall below the median income level. 

Today's code amendment also sets some limits on how long customers can wait on hold when calling cable companies. Also, cable companies sometimes sign deals with condos and apartment buildings to be an exclusive provider in those building, and the council is adding some rights for the buildings under this new code.

"You mention you're from LA, so let me put this in perspective.

This area (2nd-4th, Pike to Virginia) is just one of those things people in Seattle know exists and either hate or ignore. 

These few blocks have shitheads that hang out at it all day long. Some are addicts. Some are dealers. Some are people hanging out with addicts and dealers. 

The same few blocks are also directly between the Convention Center (conventions), Westlake Center / Pacific Place (retail core, monorail to Space Needle, end of the line for the train from the airport), and Pike Place Market, which means TONS of tourists walk down Pike on a daily basis.

Finally, it's a transit hub - not only is it the start of southbound trains towards the airport (underground), but at street level there are dozens of bus routes that stop along 3rd and take people virtually everywhere. It's a MAJOR bus traffic area (and since this isn't LA, normal people take busses here, so there's a ton of people milling about). 

Combine those three factors, and you have the proverbial shit show:

Tons of people waiting for busses. Tons of tourists wandering through. Tons of homeless addicts begging for money to buy drugs. Tons of dealers selling to homeless and anyone else, using the tons of normal people and convenient transit hubs as cover.

Putting it in the context of LA, it's much more like Downtown LA (think up near 7th/Flower in DTLA w/ a hundred people plucked from 3rd/Wilshire in Santa Monica) than it is East LA or Compton.

Even if lead correlated with a bit of a bump in the rate, there's simply no accounting for the explosive rates produced by Baby Boomers in America relative to many other nations.

American Baby Boomers are simply uniquely malign people.  Simple as that.  I wish it weren't so, and I wish they'd reform their ways... but that's not likely.",false,false,t1_cps876e,welfarecuban,,0,1427430656,t5_2qhad,t3_30gggw,t1_cps7ryx,-10,1432039719,0,0,cps876e,Seattle,-10,,

Kotlikoff's plan (in the PBS link) isn't to simply eliminate corporate taxes, but attribute all corporate profits to shareholders and tax them at the individual level.
