"I've been aware of the earthquake risk here for over 20 years. I grew up in California, was in SF for the '89 Loma Prieta quake, and when I moved here I already knew about the potential for a quake that would make '89 look like fun times in a bouncy house.

Do I worry about it? No; there's really no point. It will happen in my lifetime, or it will not, and either way it's completely out of my control. If I was truly uncomfortable with that, I'd move elsewhere. But I intend to spend the rest of my life here because no other place has felt so much like home. So if I die in a quake or its aftermath, so be it. If I lose my house and all my stuff, I can replace it. I'm staying.

That said, I do keep emergency supplies on hand, have attached tall furniture to the walls, etc. I'm confident I could do okay in a quake the size of Loma Prieta. But to be honest, if the Big One hits, it's going to be hard fucking times. I have too many pets to be able to bug out--assuming there would be anywhere to bug out to--and what if sheltering in place is not an option? What if the entire neighborhood burns down? How to deal with looters and other dangerous folks (as I don't own, and don't want to own, a firearm)?

"New technology is revolutionizing our engagement with police-- body camera footage and citizen cell phone footage is finally waking mainstream America up to the fact that blacks are subject to disproportionate police violence across the board, for example--but there’s another side to technology too. I think police work is going to change considerably with the roll out of stuff like shot-spotter, that can pinpoint gunfire, but it also raises serious privacy concerns and opens us more widely to the possibility of creating a surveillance culture. In general, we need to make clear that our police are not a military force, they are not here to monitor us or control us, and they should not be governed by a culture of secrecy. Seattle needs to be thinking about the larger ramifications of these new technologies, needs to be envisioning the best, AND WORST, case scenarios to ensure that we employ them in accordance with our stated values.

Redditors. You may hear ""Socialist"" with the name Bernie Sanders. I would like to remind you that Bernie Sanders is not an actual socialist. He is an ""Social Democrat."" Social Democracy hopes to reform capitalism and not ultimately destroy it and not replace it with Socialism. Bernie Sanders would like to keep capitalism in place, but add some welfare in place. Example of states with Social Democracy would be like Norway and Sweden. Bernie Sanders has NOT call for the workers take over of the means of production. Bernie Sanders is ok having owners steal our wealth, but our lives been less exploitative due to welfare programs.

"If you mean at the individual level, I'd agree. 

At the federal level, I'm not so sure. Like most young people my default mindset is that ""the federal government doesn't give a shit"", but at something like this, I pause on it for one big factor; the amount of military assets on the PNW are *huge*. Two to three aircraft carriers homeported in the region at any given time, two major Navy bases to accommodate said carriers (Bremerton and Everett), one of which a big shipyard where they do maintenance on naval assets, and all of the nuclear submarines up in Bangor, and no signs of slowing down investment on those assets and bases. With all that being said, I have a hard time believing that the federal government isn't aware and concerned about the risk of natural disasters and investing in preventing as much damage as they could. 

This isn't even counting the multitude of businesses centered here (Microsoft, Amazon, etc), that I'm sure the federal government would have an interest in preserving.

First off: Shiner Bock.  According to their [very own web site](http://www.shiner.com/find) you can find it here.  I hear people like it.

You probably ought to give Northwest microbrews a try though.  At least sample the beers of your maybe adopted home.


There are no Kolachis anywhere.  Those are a Houston area phenomenon.  

We don't build roads like Houston does.  Give up driving fast.  Give up driving anywhere without serious clog.  You know how it is on 59 and 610 around Reliant?  That's every highway here every day during rush hour, which lasts 4 hrs at least.

Give up having a plot of land bigger than your house.  Give up on houses over 2,000 square feet, if that.  We live Japanese style here.  We pack things into tight, steep little plots.


You know how everyone's moving to Katy and now the tollway is clogged full of people driving back for work?  that's every highway here.  

We have a smidgeon more public transport than you have, and it's better, but still not enough to make you really want to use it, at least not at first.

You might not get air conditioning here.  Most of the year you won't need it, but about a month out of the year you will, and wonder why the fuck nobody put any in your building.  On the other hand it's a dry heat, and the insect population here is about 10000000 times less than yours.  Dry ground, dry air, not many mosquitoes living on the steep hills, because there's no place for that many puddles. 

The one thing we do have is big ol spiders, like 2"" large and they bite.  

No BBQ here.  Sorry, we're not the South or the Midwest.  This comes up about once a month, ""Where can I get BBQ?""  The answer is always damn near almost nowhere.  Maybe a few are alright, nothing however will be what you are used to.

Can you handle months of 8 hours or less of light, unending low clouds, drizzle, and no sun?  If not, don't come here.  If you've ever lived in a Pacific / Japanese / Northern European / Western Canadian / Alaskan climate before, you can disregard this.

"Thanks Amazon vet,

I too am a seriously hard core old timer and can't agree enough. 

Of course, things vary depending on where you are, but lately I've seen very, very few new hires make it past the two year mark and all have been unwillingly forced out.  The whole scene has been made worse by the fact that they were all, except for one exception, excellent and hard working engineers. 

And, sure, for the intern taking his first job this is not necessarily the worst thing in the world, but I've been particularly troubled by the older hires who naively relocate families here to take a job at Amazon when I know they will be tossed out before year three.

I've seen no benefit from chucking them out and replacing them with another fresh hire.  The only benefit to the company would be that they don't have to pay out that stock.  Unfortunately for the company, I think any minor gain on this front is probably lost in the hiring and training of new employees.  Amazon can be dumb that way.

Also the stack ranking system and performance management system has little transparency and people rarely talk when they are being forced out, so even among employees who've been around a couple of years the understanding of how the whole system works is very weak.  That's part of the reason you'll see more junior staff pipe up in these sorts of discussions saying they have never seen this kind of thing. I suppose that is part of the system. If everyone knew what was going on, it would be harder to hire and retain staff, not to mention the fact that the gaming of the system would grow even more intense.

It's always hard to tell what's going on across the company, but I have noticed a notable uptick in old timers I know in other departments bailing out because of the stack ranking system -- both from the feeling that their time could come at any moment from the spin of the roulette wheel that is the selection of the low performer in a solid engineering team and from a feeling that the company culture has changed so that they can't do the right thing for the customer and the company if they are always having to cover their ass for the performance management cycle. 

There's a reason why MS gave up this system.  Stack ranking works fine if you genuinely have underperforming staff.  If you have staff with even performance who come from the top of the hiring pool, it doesn't make much sense, and only distorts your culture so that the employees spend more time gaming the system than doing good work.

I'm super sad about it.  There's a lot to like about working for Amazon, but I have a hard time seeing how any of this will be fixed any time soon.

I also wonder what effect this will have on the city.  Amazon was always to a large extent a burn and churn employer, but now that it is several orders of magnitude larger the number of new hires being cycled in and out is rather breath taking.   

I'd love to see an in depth investigation of this with some estimate on the numbers and what happens to the employees that are tossed out.  Do they go home?  Do they stay?  It seems like they mostly stay from my experience, and I continue to be impressed by the fact that they can be absorbed by the local job market.  Will that run out eventually?  Will the tech scene be oversaturated with ex-Amazonians?

The Times did a number of hit pieces on Amazon a few years ago.  Seems like they could put together something if they could muster the will.  It would be an interesting read.

Is using profanity in front of an officer against any laws?

The TLDR of this seems to be -

* Bus driver dissatisfied with police coverage;

* One specific police squad refrains from changing its practices;

* ""Heated discussion"" ensues between deputy &amp; bus driver; 

* Deputy files ""profane &amp; unprofessional"" complaint against bus driver (second deputy submits testimony verifying claim; suspicions of prompting by original deputy to do so)

* Bus driver submits body cam vid as evidence of their falsifications in claim

* Deputies under investigation/considered for termination

I'm all fine with the concept of ""police are falsifying reports, we must fire them""...but how exactly does that situation play out if they *weren't* falsifying?

"I was an Amazon intern for 3 work terms, then joined for 3.5 years of full-time afterward, and I completely disagree... Maybe things have changed in the last 10 years, but the internships were wonderful; it was more like ""here is an isolated, fun project we want to do, but we're all busy with ops... Let the intern have a crack at knocking it out.""...

There are certainly some issues with the promotion paths and compensation later on, and politics that I could have done without near the end, but otherwise it was great, and one of the things I often spoke highly of was the work-life balance.

One thing I do love about the culture was a lot of people were just planning to stick around for 2-3 years to earn enough to quit and start their own thing. It was great being around so many entrepreneurial minds and that when it was time to quit, they were like ""Sad to see you go, you can come back any time, but what you are planning on next sounds awesome.""

- You can have/purchase the same amount legally as far as flower and edibles go.

- The areas in which you can smoke are the same (on your property; out of sight) 

Differences:

- In OR you can grow 4 plants per household, in WA you cannot grow any (for recreational)

- In WA, the person purchasing the marijuana is the ONLY person who can consume it.  In OR, you can give it to your friends as long as no money has exchanged hands (this is a HUGE difference)

It certainly wasn’t perfect, but taken as a whole package, I think it represented a bold and fair direction for the city with everyone giving and taking a little. But, sure enough, it only took a week or two for the standard Seattle political process to realize that [it had accidentally produced something approaching visionary](http://thecisforcrank.com/2015/07/30/murray-gives-in-to-bullying-runs-from-housing-diversity-plan/), and to start weeding out anything remotely controversial for the [group of people most over-represented in contributions and influence](http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/seattles-richest-whitest-sway-campaign-giving-say-reform-backers/). We all need to make sacrifices to accommodate the massive growth we’re experiencing and that’s going to be a little painful. We can’t make real progress if we keep caving to our fears of change. 

Likewise, we can’t talk about Seattle’s severe shortage of affordable housing without talking about how [how much of the city is zoned single-family](http://www.seattletimes.com/opinion/open-up-seattles-single-family-zoning-to-those-who-arent-rich/). This is part of why the HALA report made it clear that it was a package deal -- everyone has to give a little for the city to gain a lot, and it’s disappointing to see even the most basic changes to zoning laws, like allowing more duplexes and mother-in-law apartments, sacrificed on the altar of single-family zones and “neighborhood character.” Look, I’m a preservationist at heart, and I want to save as many cute bungalows as we reasonably can, but Seattle isn’t Boulder, CO.

"&gt; All my friends at Google and Microsoft work long hours

Microsoft person here... just want to say that at MSFT your work experience will vary *a lot* from team to team, org to org. You're right, some teams will work you to death and demand you show up nights and weekends. Other teams are ridiculously lax when it comes to work hours and output. My old roommate used to spend his days reading books and goofing off, only spending approximately one hour a day writing code/checking stuff in. He got the highest possible performance reviews every year simply because he was smart + charismatic. The review system is biased and subjective and Microsoft does not always compensate ""fairly"" based on performance. It's also very difficult to actually get fired (lots of red tape for managers), so if you under perform you're more likely to get shipped off to a crappy team where your output doesnt matter. Management silently hoping you'll just quit out of sheer boredom. 

My lazy roommate left MSFT after 2 years because he was bored and unmotivated. I'm leaving in a month (after five years) for similar reasons plus I've found a very kickass replacement gig.

So listen up interns, Microsoft will treat you like an interchangeable code-monkey but they'll pay you well and if you're lucky you might just get put on a project you find interesting (but probably not). Eventually you'll realize that MSFT's review process gives you very little motivation to excel at your job so you'll either settle into an ""Office Space"" mentality or you'll start searching for greener pastures.

There are pros and cons when it comes to working at a big company like Microsoft or Amazon vs. a startup and you should think pretty hard about it before you make a decision. Lastly, don't be afraid to leave a job you don't like and chase after one that you do. I see a lot of my co-workers living in fear over job security and I'm blown away by how low they value their own skill and ability to work someplace else.

"Having been here for the Nisqually earthquake in 2001, the earthquake is practically over by the time you realize what is happening.

After the earthquake, phone lines and cell lines were overloaded, so you may or may not be able to get ahold of family, SO, whomever.  I drove home right after the earthquake as did my wife and traffic was not to bad.  Later in the day, officials started to shut down roads and it was almost impossible to travel anywhere.

Survival plans are great on paper, but when the old adrenaline hits 110 percent, you forget to go back and review that document.  

One other big difference, in Iraq we got used to being on the receiving end of mortar attacks on a fairly regular basis, so we were somewhat ready for things to go bad quickly.   I don't think the average Joe Seattle is ready for the 10:03 earthquake on a random weekday.

"Ex amazon SDE 1 here(2.5 years and quit). I agree with pretty much everything OP says. I want to add that if your review is messed up in the first year
i.e you don't get an ""Achieves"" and ""solid strength"" in leadership principles, you cannot move teams without getting approvals from your manager/VP. 

For folks on F-1 and H-1b visa, amazon doesn't start Permanent residency processing unless you become SDE-2.  In general, their immigration dept is pretty slow in getting things done. 

Here is some advice for new SDE-1's at amazon:

    1). You have to work on building a relationship with your manager, there is no way around this. Even if he is a prick, your life will be  a lot easier at amazon if you win your manager's support.
 
    2). Pro-activeness is the word. Make your voice heard,  participate in team meetings, sprint planning (even if you might think they are a waste of time). 
          Pay serious attention to those leadership principles, and try to be exhibit them as much as you can. 

    3). Finally, there is no honemoon phase for new joiners at amazon. Be sure to put in a lot of effort in your first year, trust me this would make your     subsequent years a lot easier.

"Strangle is a strong word to say ""limits to some degree"". The question is really about basic housing needs, not rent control. I'd love rent control in my $2k apartment, but I don't need it.

We're trying to get at extremely poor people's right to *stay in housing*, and stay in a region they can reasonably find work.

Does rent control mess with market behavior? Of course. That's the point, to minimize the inequities caused by purely market-driven housing development. It comes with tradeoffs, but they can be minimized and/or considered worth the cost.

"Seattle has only really been our definition of ""liberal"" within the last 40 or so years.  Prior to that, it was (and still is) predominately white, and was also primarily working class families who worked in logging, fishing, and manufacturing.  Seattle also has had bans of the following minorities living in the city: Native Americans (19th century), Chinese workers (expelled in the riots during the 1880s), Japanese (internment camps in WW2), and in 1964 Seattle voters overwhelmingly defeated an ""open residency"" act (2 to 1 margin) that would have allowed minorities to live outside of their segregated neighborhoods.  White residents in Capitol Hill went door to door asking residents to sign a petition to keep the Hill white, specifically to keep black people south of Madison St.

It wasn't until the Central District threatened to riot after Martin Luther King's assassination in 1968 that the city passed the open housing ordinance.  Parts of Alki and Ballard to View Ridge and Wedgwood were restricted to “whites and Caucasians only,” or banned “Jews” and “Hebrews,” “Negroes” or “Ethiopians,” “Asiatics,” Chinese, Japanese, “Hindus” or “Malays” (Filipinos) from owning property or residing there. In wealthier neighborhoods such as Windermere and Broadmoor, domestic servants were conveniently exempt from this.  In the 1930s and 1940s, good old Bill Boeing and his wife made their company housing ""whites only"" - the neighborhoods of Blue Ridge, Richmond Beach, and Innis Arden. 

Seattle has historically been far from being the liberal, accepting haven of all people.  It was just as racist as Atlanta, Charleston, or Birmingham - the South was just much more open about it.

The problem is when it's done wrong (motorcyclists zipping by over 15mph faster than the traffic they're filtering through), and when drivers aren't aware of this.

There is a reason why tech. has to bring so many people from out of state/country to fill their positions. WA and Seattle have done a piss poor job of educating and preparing people for the jobs that are booming in our own economy. There are so many reasons why Microsoft would prefer to pull people directly from our local pools rather than reaching across to the other side of the globe for employees. What does that tell you of the failure of our local government and voters to act? The community feels rather broken imo. It's hard not to take it personally.

"I've lived in Seattle my whole life. I'm a city kid, I love urban areas and the Seattle area offers the perfect blend of natural beauty and urban excitement.

I'm 20 and split my time between LA for university and Seattle for summers. I have mixed feelings about the growth and gentrification of this city. On one hand, currently living in west LA gives me perspective: Seattle has a long way to go before it starts being as absurdly expensive and wealthy as LA and SF. Seattle is still largely low density, and our surrounding areas are vastly more affordable and accessible compared to the city suburbs of California. I love the young, techy vibe of SLU and Belltown, and I think the growth and prosperity is positive for the city culture as a whole.

At the same time, rent prices are definitely not going down. People who aren't competitive in the job market or already settled in the city will be priced out. This really sucks. Unfortunately, this is a reality of living in a desirable urban area on the West Coast. I chose a computer science degree in part because I know it will give me the freedom to live independently in Seattle within my means. I hope you find a career path that will take you where you want to go. If you have any interest in programming, I strongly recommend following that interest.

"I take the bus because I only have 1 car and I leave it at home in case my wife needs it for an emergency or if she has to go somewhere.

I stood there until I had the last standing spot on a bus at 5:15, 1 hour and 15 minutes after I got out there. 

This really fucking sucks. Like, I actually thought about buying a car just so I wouldn't have to stand. The problem is that I would end up just idling in traffic, wasting gas, polluting the air, and being just as pissed off about the long commute time as I am about it now.

My life would become at least 2 to 3 times easier with that. I would show up to work more instead of watching traffic wondering how much its going to suck that day and WFH instead.

Dear Seattle Parents:

Don't bring your young children to the dog park. Seattle has 300 playgrounds for children. There are 5 playgrounds for dogs. We don't want your kids in the dog park. -5 points for each additional kid. -10 points if the parent is texting. -20 points if you let your toddler wander more that 6 feet from your arm. -50 points if you let the kid carry treats (Think about it!!!)

If I see you and your toddler in the dog park, this is what will happen. I will say in a loud voice. ""Please keep your son away from my dog. She attacks children."" In truth, my dog is friendly, but I'm hoping your child will hear me, and discourage you from bringing him to the dog park again.

"&gt; And it's been a huge success! 

This is a ridiculous thing to say. The ""rental price brake"" has only been in effect since June 1st.  

And I think it is also ridiculous to say that a lobby made up of renters is in opposition to ""NIMBY owners.""  

NIMBY is an acronym that has sadly lost it's original and useful definition of ""Not In My Back Yard"", referring to people who want and need a service to exist, like a garbage dump or a sewage treatment plant, but want that service to be housed somewhere other than next their home.  It's useful way to describe a genuine and somewhat natural problem in communities.

There is nothing NIMBY about being against rent control.  People who don't want rent control don't want it anywhere, not just on their own property.

On this subreddit, NIMBY has degraded into meaning looking after your own selfish interests at the expense of others which is a facet of the original definition of NIMBY, but not the original, complete definition.  

I assume that that is what you mean here, but even that use is silly in this context.  It's not like people who want rent control aren't selfish as well.  They want something that benefits themselves at the expense of property owners and other potential renters.  

One could argue it is, in fact, a bit more selfish as it harms more people than a landlord raising rents.  If a landlord turns over an apartment to make way for a higher paying tenant, only the old tenant is unhappy.  If the old tenant manages to force the landlord to continue to rent to him at his original rent, it makes the landlord and the other potential renter unhappy.

Note, I'm not saying that people getting pushed out of their apartments is a good thing, or something I want to see happen.  I just would like people to approach this problem with clear understanding.

On a side note, I would not like Seattle to go the way of Germany and have more people renting than owning.  I would rather see Seattle work to get more people into ownership of their homes. 

In neighborhoods with high ownership, new residents have moved in paying much more for their homes and the old residents who have left have not kicked up a fuss.  They made a choice to leave and take their windfall with them.  Ownership allows the marketplace to work to let new residents in and let old residents make a choice.  Not sure how the city could really help with this, but it certainly would be more effective in increasing overall happiness of residents than rent control.",false,false,t1_cter1y5,world_emmanuel,,0,1437756994,t5_2qhad,t3_3eg2md,t1_ctepv5w,14,1440061153,0,0,cter1y5,Seattle,14,,

In other words, the Blue Angels are a marketing program - propaganda: information that is not impartial and used primarily to influence an audience and further an agenda - to get people fucking pumped about the military.

"&gt; what's your opinion on rent control? more specifically do you support council woman sawant's stance on rent control.

As I responded to u/Cosmo-DNA I do not support rent control as has been implemented elsewhere--e.g. NYC and SF. I am open to hearing proposals for higher linkage fees, but would want to see the nexus. The devil is in the details with all programs. I believe wholeheartedly in mandatory inclusionary up-zoning as a long term strategy. In the short term, I have proposed vouchers to help with displacement issues. 


&gt; Given sound transit's history of completing projects on time and under budget. why don't we shuttle more Mass transit projects to them?

Because Sound Transit has limited authority as a government.This past legislative session, they had to fight incredibly hard to simply get the ability to put a measure on our ballot. Sound Transit is a regional government and at the will of the people throughout the Puget Sound region.


&gt; Community centers are great public spaces, but are too bloated with staff and rarely utilized programs. can we use a model like the one proposed where Rainier beach CC would run programs from the center while parks staff would just be in charge of maintenance of the facility instead of the task of programming for the building? why reinvent the wheel if a successful entity exists without the resources of the city, why not just give them the resources..

I would be interested in learning more about this proposal. This is the first I am hearing about it and I will certainly be looking into.


&gt; Do you uber? do you take taxis? which and why. what model do you wish to see emulated as a chauffer service in Seattle.

I use both Uber and taxis. I prefer uber, because it is far more convenient for me and I have had too many taxi drivers demand that I pay them in cash. I think it is however is important that we issue of privacy and that we regulate companies such as Uber to protect consumers.


&gt; Finally, sonics arena. share your feelings on a SODO NBA/NHL arena and public funding.

As I wrote to u/CougFanDan, yes. The John Oliver segment was very well done and very well taken. We should consider the most appropriate to fund this.

I believe cities support many activities. Should Seattle have a symphony? An Opera? Roller Derby? I think yes. I think regardless of whether or not any of us personally enjoy something, we should appreciate that there are many thousands of people in our city that do enjoy it and we should support them in those activities.

* A cabinet maker is running a gas fire inside his wooden building to heat some glue. Glue boils over, catches fire, and ignites the pile of turpentine-soaked woodchips immediately adjacent. Also note that the building is still made of wood.
* Cabinet maker attempts to extinguish a grease fire with water, and gets the result you should expect
* Fire spreads to a neighboring liquor store, *which explodes*, as well as a pair of pubs.
* According to the Seattle Underground Tour guide last time I went, Seattle's armory was also across the street, full of explosives and such
* The Fire Chief is in San Francisco attending a firefighters convention. Firefighters still go to work.
* Water system is shit. All the hoses share pressure, so each hose makes every other hose less effective.
* Seattlites heckle the firefighters for being terrible at their jobs
* Firefighters declare ""screw you guys, I'm going home"". Seattle is already obviously fucked.
* 120 acres destroyed
* estimated $8-$20 million dollars in damages
* 5000 jobs lost

&gt;What's your position closing the viaduct for safety reasons? Will you fight the state to get it closed immediately if elected, before an earthquake gets it?

The whole rationale for that project was that the viaduct was a safety issue and needed to come down. Then the political class got excited by the money involved in a huge tunnel and here we are, almost fifteen years later, the viaduct still there, slowly crumbling. So much for public safety. Tearing down the viaduct should have been the first thing we did, and we would’ve adapted to the change easily. That’s why they won’t tear it down now: by leaving it up they make it appear that the tunnel is a desperate need. If we tore it down tomorrow the people would quickly realize we never needed the tunnel in the first place.
The earthquake question is real and valid, but it’s also still a question of transportation priorities and the environment too. Are we building a city infrastructure that’s predicated on single occupancy, internal combustion engined cars? If so, we are making poor choices. We should tear the viaduct down and start acknowledging that the waterfront is the true face of the city.

&gt;What's your position on getting more police down into each part of the city?

I wrote about this more extensively in my [public safety paper](http://www.voteroderick.com/public_safety), but we need to do a few separate things. First, we need to hold the Mayor to the [hiring goals he set for himself](http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/how-many-police-officers-is-enough/Content?oid=20712411) in 2014 and make sure we’re adding officers *relative to the growth of the city.* We perpetually need to get cops out of their cars in crime hot spots, vigorously recommit to the bike cop model we invented, and always focus our resources on curbing violent crime. Shots fired in Seattle have gone up 20% each of the past two years, and this has already been a terrible summer for gun violence. We need action, more than anything else, and this council has been basically silent on any real reform, preferring to focus on public relations.

&gt;What's your position on police reform and oversight?

Again, check out [my position paper](http://www.voteroderick.com/police_reform) for more details, but as the Community Police Commission continues to travel through the bureaucratic web of the Department of Justice, the Seattle Police Department, and the Officers Guild, I’m paying close attention. We need a stakeholders group like that to offer recommendations on police reform, ESPECIALLY in light of the continued national disgrace of biased and violent policing. This is an area where we should lead the country. Our police should be a model force, and we need local leaders to hasten that change. 

&gt;Would you rather fight a horse sized Tim Burgess or one hundred duck sized Tim Burgesses?

You are stipulating that I would be fighting “horse-sized” or “duck sized” Burgesses, rather than a horse, or army of ducks, with the faces and intelligence of Burgess. If it was a choice between fighting a horse or a hundred ducks, I would choose the horse. But a choice between a 1200 pound Burgess and one hundred 10 pound Burgesses, I would choose the small Burgesses.

"Lived in Castle Rock from 1975-1999.  Most of the town was flooded as the river overfilled with silt.  Anyone who was in town moved their belongs and themselves to higher ground and lots of people had friends and family live with them for extended periods of time.  Movement around/in/out of town was nearly impossible as roads were washed away and/or buried under water and silt.  For months people walked around town with medical-style face masks to protect their lungs from the ash which would be stirred up from the ground.

Even now, you can still drive on I-5 and see the remnants of the dredging that took place as 40-50 foot tall piles of sand pulled from the Cowlitz river still sit beside the freeway (now blocked mostly by alder trees).  It does make for some fun ATV activities though.  All around Castle Rock, all the playfields are all made of this sand with a layer of dirt on top.  If you walk up and down the Cowlitz River in town, there is a 20-30 foot dike between the river and the town to prevent the river from spilling into the town... in fact for 10 years or so after the eruption, areas in and around town would be continually flooded with only marginally more than normal rainfall.

The town and surrounding areas lost about 10% - 20% of its population.  The school district went from about 1,500 students to about 1,000 (Source:  parents taught in the school district).  This was great for class sizes but bad for funding as the per capita allotment didn't meet the requirements for the district.  As such, special levies were required to make up the difference.  This directly impacted future levies for other things that were needed by the district not related to the eruption because people were ""taxed enough already"".  You would often see the high school sports teams having to do fund raisers to pay for basic items like uniforms and equipment and busdriver pay.

It did bring in a ton of tourism to town though.  There are three visitors centers in the area and there were really interesting tours you could take of the effects of the pyroclastic floe.

You can still bicycle to continue on in society.

Take the lane if you feel like there's not enough room for a car to pass you safely - don't feel bad about the cars behind you, its your right to be on the road and the maybe 1-2 minutes you inconvenience them is well worth your safety.

A protected bike lane doesn't mean you can bomb down it without paying attention, the Roosevelt bike lane is a good example of this - there are many crosswalks and right turns that bring pedestrians and cars into and across the bike lane, and you don't want to collide with either. 

LIGHTS! Get some good lights. A back light is great for letting others know you're there when you can't see them, and front lights are for your safety...it gets fucking dark fucking early in Seattle once Fall/Winter get here, and being able to see the giant pothole gaping in front of you helps you avoid smashysmashface. 

Gloves - necessity for winter for obvious reasons, but fingerless for summer are recommended by yours truly since when you do fall (everyone takes a few dives starting out, and even people who've been riding for years make mistakes) you don't want skinned palms. 

Don't use cable locks, get a U-Lock and you might want to lock [like this](https://www.sfbike.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Locking-Techniques-Rear-Triangle-Thumb.jpg)

Bike thieves are active in Seattle, and no lock will discourage them entirely...so keep your bike inside your apartment instead of locked outside at night, and if you're on the Ave don't park it next to groups of ave rats for very long. 

Sometimes confused people from the suburbs drive into Seattle and can't wrap their heads around bikes as transport - they see you as engaging in a recreational activity that inconveniences them, sometimes they'll honk or yell at you when you're doing completely legal and safe things. The following responses are acceptable and encouraged: flipping the bird, brandishing U-locks, angrily yelling ""BIKE RIGHTS,"" kicking their car at the next stoplight. 

I think overall I'm not concerned for my own safety, collisions happen and cyclists die - but that's true of cars and drivers too, there's no way of utilizing roads that's 100% safe from drunks and morons, but overall if you're assertive about your space (take the lane, take the lane, take the lane) and relatively attentive to your surroundings I don't think its a very dangerous way to get around.

"i've just started bicycle commuting part-time (capitol hill to fremont, so i get to be separated from traffic for most of it) so others will be way more qualified to talk about bicycle-specific stuff, but i want to say this: you must learn how to control your vehicle. 

you haven't ridden since you were a kid, and the bike you're on now will be wildly different from what you rode then. the disc brakes will be crazy powerful in comparison, the handling will be different, the riding position will be different, the controls will be different. you need to get 100% comfortable with these changes as fast as you can. get into a big parking lot or just on a quiet street and practice swerving, panic stops, do them standing, sitting, ride up and down curbs, do everything you can. lock up your back wheel and control it. wheelie. stoppie. then do it all on dirt, gravel, sand, grass, and wet and dry asphalt. do shit you never think you'll do daily because it'll expand your comfort envelope.

if controlling your vehicle isn't instinct, you're gonna have a bad time. when a pedestrian steps into the bike lane, you need to know how to swerve around. when a car pulls out in front of you, you need to know how to stop fast without going over the bars or locking up your front wheel. when you hit a pothole (and oh god you will hit potholes) you need to know how to let the bike settle back down. there are great books on bike skills if you learn that way. 

other than that, general advice for operating any vehicle applies: never go faster than you can stop or see, keep your head on a fucking swivel, be visible, signal your intentions (hand signals work!), stay the fuck out of blind spots, read ahead, and - advice i received early on in motorbike riding that has saved me on motorbikes and bicycles and in cars - think about the worst thing that car can do and assume they're going to do it (are they gonna turn left in front of me? yes. what would i do? what are my outs? etc. and recalculate as you get closer). never believe that they see you.

the above is mostly what i've learned from 10+ years of motorscooter commuting, and in my experience (limited, so far) in bicycle commuting it all applies.

"Our Puritanical culture always balks at the idea of real solutions to homelessness because so many people instinctively resist the idea of giving people something for “free.” Seriously, we would rather have thousands of people suffering, living and dying in the shadows, than suffer the blow to our righteous conviction that people don’t deserve help unless they prove their worthiness.

The fact is that, even if you factor out all the questions of humanity and ethics, it’s just CHEAPER to house the homeless and care for them and give them medical attention and treatment in a safe environment, than it is to constantly cycle them through emergency rooms and hospitals and jails. Right now we see those various expenses spread out over different silos, police and hospital budgets, non-profits, churches, etc., so we can’t properly measure the expense and redirect those resources. We depend on state funding that seems to never come, and squander money elsewhere that just prolongs suffering. 

The city has the capacity to expand things like tent encampments and the safe parking program, both of which are relatively low cost and provide a noticeable safety and security improvement over living on the street, but that’s falling well short of what’s needed.

-The nearest bus stop is an exit down the highway from me.  So I'm going into my car, anyways

-My car runs on my schedule, not someone else's

-Perhaps most importantly:  It's the only time I'm alone.  Think about the average person for a second.  They are with at least 1 other person (usually at least 2 once kids are factored in) all morning till they leave the house.  Then you're surrounded by people for 9 hours as you're at the office.

4. And finally, the extension is on existing NJ Transit tracks - no new train right of way needs to be made. The extension we're talking about is also a little less than 2.0 miles

"No, you are wrong because the only reason kids aren't at risk of getting polio in this country is because we vaccinate so many. Polio, unlike smallpox, is still present in areas of the world, namely the Middle East and parts of Africa. That puts polio about a 12 hour plane ride away from the US. It could literally arrive here any minute, so the threat is still very real. The minute the number of vaccinated kids starts to drop is the same minute the risk of infections starts to go up. We also no longer give the live attenuated polio vaccine in this country. The vaccine given now is completely inactivated virus meaning there is NO CHANCE you can ""get"" polio from the vaccine. Vaccination remains the safest option as actually infection could happen in this country. Your current risk-benefit analysis only holds true because polio hasn't come surging back in the US.... yet.

"Dude, chill out.

You say you have worked at Amazon ""a little while"" which I could have guessed from your level of understanding of how the company works.

OP is offering solid advice.  The fact that OP would work at Amazon and still try to warn away young intern hires is in no way hypocritical.  It's a reflection of some basic facts about how Amazon works.
The seasoned staff have an advantage over these new hires in the stack ranking system, particularly naive ones who have yet to be clued in.  

I suspect you could stand to get some solid inside advice as well.  The fact that you think an individual manager could just be a better manager to the SDE I's and then OP's concerns go away is telling.  

There is a system at work here.  The performance management system at Amazon requires a certain percentage of employees get tossed out every year.  This is not up to the manager no matter how competent or decent.  

Trust me, your manager can be keeping the morale up and everyone can seem like they are all part of an awesome team and then they run out of incompetent people to fire and have to just start finding warm bodies to push off the train.  It can be hard to notice as a new hire as no one getting PIP'ed out of the company is going to tell you about it, they are just going to disappear one day.

I'd seriously recommend getting under the wing of someone with some seniority who you can trust and who will be seriously frank with you about how the system works, someone with at least five years experience.

"Municipal broadband is a necessity for Seattle to be the “technology mecca” we claim to be, and the only thing preventing us from having municipal broadband is political will. When the mayor released that broadband study a few weeks ago, [I wrote a position paper](http://www.voteroderick.com/don_t_give_up_on_municipal_broadband) arguing for a public utility model for citywide broadband to bring the city up to 1 Gbps. This is a perfect example of what I mean when I say that there is a severe shortage of imagination at city hall: most of our elected officials seem to think the internet is a luxury or a toy, and the current council isn’t even interested in discussing a $5 million pilot project -- chump change for a project of this tremendous significance. I say devote the capital and, as a city, we will reap the rewards for decades.

I’ll also note that I think the ignorance on this issue is cultural: a lot of tech workers who get the incredible importance of municipal broadband are marginalized from conversations about the future of our city. Tech companies are more than their CEOs, and when we either demonize or ignore the thousands of tech-savvy people in our city, we end up with a city government that sees the internet as just a Facebook delivery system.

"I think a lot of people are failing to realize that a lot of tech workers are in fact contractors who make about 50k a year, if that... and that is if they work an entire year. Many contracts will last only a matter of months and then they have deal with being unemployed. For anyone wanting to scream ""go on unemployment,"" clearly does not understand that is not always an option. So in the end many tech workers are in fact making less than waitresses. 

Not everyone who works for a tech company is fucking rich. It also seems that people fail to realize the amount of training, education and experience gets someone above the $60k mark. I distinctly remember close to 50% of the people dropping out of CS classes because it was too much work for them. Many of whom decided to go some other route such as a Lib Arts degree. Frankly, life is full of choices and for anyone looking at tech workers who make closer to $100k with envy has no one to blame but themselves.

"It was a great debate, and illuminating for several reasons. The best 'friendly' moments came when Sawant and Valdez talked about alternative solutions as well - increasing supply. 

Kshama even said during the debate: Rent control, by itself, will not fix all housing affordability issues. It has to be part of a comprehensive overhaul.

I am a huge fan what Vienna was able to accomplish to solve affordability issues. It is one the largest municipal-owned housing systems in Europe, and takes care of both what Valdez and Manwell explained as 'an issue of supply' and also taking care of the problem with what Sawant and Licata would caution as: ""speculative developers and landlords exploiting that supply by raising rents""

There is room for other ideas beyond rent control. I like to think about combining it with a mass municipal-owned housing, like in Vienna. [Vienna Offers Affordable and Luxurious Housing](http://www.governing.com/topics/economic-dev/gov-affordable-luxurious-housing-in-vienna.html):

The people of Seattle want affordability, and the growing economy requires more supply. To do both, look to the plan in Vienna:

* Rent Control - Rents typically not rising above inflation.

* Mass Municipal Housing - Vienna owns and manages 220,000 units.

* Tenants Rights

"Be careful.  Team culture does vary, but the stack ranking system is applied across the company (unless you are in a job category in an org with too few employees, there is a bound, but if you are a dev you are probably subject to it).

I've had several employees come to me in the last year to cry about their low review or PIP that came out of the blue after two years without any complaints from their managers.  I totally understand their surprise, they were doing solid work and weren't clued in.  Someone has to get cut, and it will be you if you are not careful.

Here are a few tips from a veteran:

Your manager is almost certainly not looking out for your interests.  You need to be aggressive about talking about building your promotion path and your review at every one on one.  

Be sure to grab as much high profile work as possible.  It won't help you to do excellent work if it doesn't look good on paper.  Be careful about screwing over your teammates though.  You are going to need some allies to do well in the performance management system.  I've seen people fail out because they always scrambled for high profile work and never carried their load on ops and just pissed everyone else off.  You need to at least look like a team player, but maximize your own advantage.  Of course, it's best to be genuinely helpful, but if it is at a serious cost to yourself, you have to reconsider or get bounced.

Don't work for a manager who can't hold his own in an argument and if you find yourself without a manager get to a group with a strong one who likes you.  The stack ranking is done with each manager defending his staff.  If you don't have a strong manager, or worse don't have a manager, you are at risk.

Don't accept promises for change in the future.  If your manager isn't giving you the right sort of work, don't accept crap work today for a promise of good projects in the future.  There are no promises at Amazon.  It's not that your manager will renege, it's just that given the rate of manager turn over, it's not unlikely that your manager will be gone next year.

I don't mean to be a downer, but hope you consider taking this advice.

 * Track Time - If you arent working on a specific work task, stop your clock.  This comment right here? non billable. Fuck me.
 * Start as soon as you can -- The longer I wait to start working in the morning, the longer it takes to get me started.
 * Have a Routine -- Goes with the top one for me.  I wake up, make coffee, grab some fruit and yogurt, and go to my desk ASAP.
 * Have a dedicated workspace -- This helps you stay in a ""working"" state of mind.  I don't have my guitars in my office, or anything else
 * Try Standing -- I use a standing desk. This keeps me uncomfortable and motivated to work, not to chill out in a comfortable chair.   I look forward to finishing up and taking a sit on my sofa. Also good for back/spine/health/activity in general.
 * Have a work buddy -- Every tuesday me and a buddy meet up at a coffee shop at 7:30 AM. We work Till 11:30 AM. We take lunch till 1PM. We work till 5PM.  Helps with sanity, monotony, and accountability.

"I took the bus for high school also, and started riding it by myself when i was about 12. My mom doesn't drive(i grew up in fremont, granola hippy of sorts) so i also rode it since before i could walk with her. 

* My mom was at the stop and [witnessed this](http://www.kirotv.com/news/news/pedestrian-killed-by-bus/nKrsk/). She called me crying and screaming, and i couldn't understand what she was even trying to say for several minutes. Depressingly, She has shit luck for this sort of thing because she looked over years later to see [this](http://www.oregonlive.com/pacific-northwest-news/index.ssf/2014/08/driver_of_seattle_garbage_truc.html) happen. She also knows someone who was fucking ON [this bus](http://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/29/us/seattle-shooting-and-bus-crash-investigated-as-murder-suicide.html) that crashed off aurora in to that apartment building in the 90s. 

* Hopped on the 16 to downtown from northgate. Me and my friend were maybe... 13 and had gone on a mission to gamestop to pick up some game, taken for goddamn ever, and were now on a like 11:30pm bus on a tuesday or some off night. We were the only ones on the bus, and we were both tired and being really quiet. A normal looking ballard dad type guy gets on the bus with a *really* beautiful woman and they go all the way to the back. Well, once we're to about stone way we realize that they're on the long back seat above the engine *fucking like crazy*. Like, full on legs up on shoulders loud grunting screaming porno sex. And we were in that seat across from the back door, pretty close. You could hear the slapping sounds LOUD. Needless to say, we were in *complete shock and awe*. The driver was a younger woman who just didn't know what the fuck to do, too . We'd look up towards the front and just see her glancing in the mirror, talking on the radio/drivers phone, and looking really nervous. When they got to the stop in front of the 7-11 *he pulled out a huge wad of cash*, gave her a bunch of it... and she winked and him and hopped off just before the back door closed. This remains, despite my travels all over, one of the most brazen and fucking ridiculous things i've ever seen. 

* There used to be a guy who rode the 43 and a few other buses(it always seemed like it was the trolley routes) fairly regularly who wore cut up army fatigues with a huge frame pack. In the pack, with it's bottom cut out and random straps sewn and taped on was a full sized(like a [q or an s on here](https://www.praxairdirect.com/Industrial-Gas-and-Welding-Information-Center/Cylinder-Cryo-and-Gas-System-Information/Cylinder-Size-Information.html)) pressurized cylinder running to a mask hanging around his neck. It was NOT an oxygen tank, nor an oxygen tank sized mask. It was some kind of weird black gas mask. He'd rock back and forth and chant stuff like ""symptomatic nerve gas"" and ""the air is moving, IT MUST BE ALIVE"".

* A friend of mine got kicked out of his dads house in high school. Another friend had a place he could crash at for a while... but he needed to move all his stuff... and none of us had cars. So we hauled it all to the 66 stop, waited for the first bus of the morning... and the driver was game. We had several pieces of decent sized furniture *and he let us use the wheelchair lift to load it*. We ended up filling basically the entire area behind the back door with stuff. He took several pictures with a pocket cam, and was cracking up the whole time. It was the earliest bus on a sunday so it was empty the entire run pretty much, and he had several layovers to not run early. He said something like ""oh man, none of the other guys are gonna believe this one, i can't believe you kids tried this. thanks for making my day"" as we finished unloading it.

* Got punched in the throat for, and i quote, ""being a little bitch"" on the 48... by a dwarf. Seriously. He waited til the back doors opened, then he ran up and jumped like fucking mario complete with the upturned fist and just nailed me. I had just been standing there and idly talking to my friends and hadn't even noticed him. He glided right out the door and was gone before me or my friends could even react. It took a looooong time to live that one down and was an endlessly repeated story that i had to tell about 300 times over the next couple months, and still heard about for years. I think i was in to my 20s before i stopped occasionally getting asked if it was true. 

* I was riding the last 44 eastbound from the 7-11 stop closest to golden gardens right after high school. We get on, and the only other people on the bus are a bunch of serious bros. Like, sports jerseys/polo shirts/backwards caps. The exact stereotype 6-7 years ago. A few stops in to the ride, they all stand up and start making louder and louder chimp sounds and *swinging from the fucking bars*. Not the types to miss a cue, *we all jump up and join them*. The bus stops at ballard ave &amp; market and half to a dozen people get on, turn the corner, and notice a bunch of mid 20s shitfaced frat boys and me and my friends screaming monkey noises as loud as we could and swinging around ramming in to eachother. There was probably 10 or 12 of us total. The instant the doors close, we all sit down and act completely normal like it never happened. The driver never reacted *at all*. In a way, i guess i was part of someone else's ridiculous story. 

* A scary as fuck looking scarred and scabbed up hobo threatened to assault the driver in various ways if he didn't let him ride for free. The driver parked and called the cops and said i'm sitting here until you get arrested. The bus was full, and everyone chanted ""FUCK YOU - GET OFF - FUCK YOU - GET OFF"" REAAAALLLY loud until he well, did. And i mean *everybody*. Little old ladies, kids, amazon nerd looking guys, punks, drunks. Anyone you can imagine riding the bus at 11pm.

* In the 90s, the buses were some serious mad max shit. The 6(which was similar to, but not exactly like the 358) basically connected the ID to aurora. It was basically amazon fresh for drugs. I saw people openly shooting up and pissing on that bus. The worst though, was a guy who wedged his ass between the | _ of the back seats with his pants down and sprayed out about 5 gallons of liquid shit. It came out like a broken windex bottle, and he was a big enough guy(probably &gt;400lbs) that his ass was literally wedged between the seats and he was just slipping in his own shit trying to stand up. My mom had a *completely* iron constitution and just sprayed some perfume on her neck, sighed, and slid her scarf up. The shit ran all the way to the back door of the bus, eventually. 

* Saw a guy puke behind the back seat on the 48. It was one of the old articulated buses that had a rear window and a little ""shelf"" area back there(complete with the ""DO NOT SIT IN HERE"" signs). This caused a chain reaction of several other people who were unlucky enough to be sitting right there puking over the back seat onto that shelf. It filled it a pretty meaningful amount. When the bus hit some craters going down the hill on 24th it cascaded over the back of the seat. I rode behind the driver for the rest of the trip. 

* One time on the 41 it got deadlocked on the southbound express lane because of a wreck or something. A guy sidled up the back door, went ""AWW HELL NAH"", pulled out his dick and just pissed on the door. It actually ran right out the door, and out of the bus. This was a standing room only PACKED bus, so he peed like inches away from several peoples legs and feet. He was a HUGE, like 6'5+ and pretty buff guy so no one said shit. 

* Enough puke and shit though. A guy once ranted at length about how great of a pimp he was, and how much better of a pimp he was than... me? He was talking to his friend in the seat next to him, and described my friend who was with me(who was really tall, and a modern and ballet dancer) as ""my only hoe"". We thought it was funny to the point that we started up a fake conversation in that vein. Eventually the guy came over and sat down to give me *pimping advice*, which i really wish i had recorded, because it was amazing.

* Similarly, i lived on aurora near the motels for a while up past 85th. I saw *some shit*. HUGE fights between tons of women at the bus stop ripping eachothers hair out and smashing faces in the benches and shit. Pimps dressed up like, well, *fucking movie pimps*, with the canes and 3 piece suits and everything, getting in to screaming arguments about pimping. 

* One time on the 44, long enough ago that they were still running the terrible [70s trolleys](http://mehva.org/bus1008.html), the bus i was on crashed in to a volvo going down the hill towards dicks on 45th. Seeing as how volvos are indestructible, and old buses are indestructible... it just drove OVER it, GTA style, and kind of just landed on top of it. I was the only person not knocked out of my seat because i was sitting with my legs against the seat ahead of me. The bus was basically highcentered on the engine block of the car. It looked pretty crazy and unreal, and i wish i had a picture. This was back before anyone had phonecams though.

"The law of unintended consequences hits progressive causes rather harshly quite often. Partly because sometimes those causes are based on pie in the sky fantasies that aren't backed up by reality and there is a resistance to bringing those fantasies down to Earth, but also partly because often they represent making a big change to an existing system, which typically has a higher chance of exposing unexpected behavior than simply leaving something alone (the classic ""the devil you know"" problem).

The same is true of labor laws as well. One may imagine that laws which mandate that full-time employees be given benefits and various protections are a boon to employees, but the reality is that for the people on the ""lowest rungs"" of the economy who need the most protections such laws tend to be detrimental.

"I'm a six year vet which puts me in the 95% category. I'm also leaving pretty soon. I don't feel the need to be behind a throwaway. My experience is as a developer, so I will exclusively talk about the SDE experience.

&gt;Now, the average employee stays at Amazon for LESS than two years

Is this actually true for devs? Yes, the average employee has a short tenure, but what's the average tenure for a dev?

&gt;Two years is also the amount of time you have to get promoted from Software Development Engineer 1 to Software Development Engineer 2

No. You have 4 years.

&gt;Amazon's work life balance is awful

When you are making the decision about whether or not to go full time for your team, talk to your peers and ask them what their work-life balance is like. So much of it varies team-to-team. On my current team, I work between 35 and 45 hours a week. I've been paged after-hours only twice in the last year. So no, not every team has it bad and this is something in your control.

&gt;You'll be stack ranked against your peers

Yeah, that's somewhat accurate.

&gt;I'm sure you will kick ass on your projects this year. Work hard but don't spend all night working

Good advice for anyone working anywhere.

And then to answer the anticipated question - if its so great, why am I leaving? IMHO, one of the worst things that can happen to you in your career as a dev is to get overly specialized, and I've grown concerned that was happening at Amazon.

One of the comments mentions that the Duwamish were spread among other tribes. Part of the reason for that and other related problems stems from the city pushing native people out of the city in the latter part of the 1800s, including an ordinance that ""prevented"" people from making permanent settlements in the city once the longhouses were torched. This, among other things, forced people to relocate with their families in other villages.

"That may be the ambient air temperature outside, but the inside of a house or apartment can remain much, much hotter. 

Depending on window exposure and airflow, someone's home might get significantly hotter inside during the day, and stay that way. The upstairs of my house used to get at least 20F hotter than outside temps, and not even come close to cooling down to a comfortable temp until just before dawn. And even after only 4-5 days of 85F+ heat, it failed to cool down completely--heat gradually built up over many days, and even after a heat wave broke it would take an extra day for the house to fully cool down again.

So if the daily high is 85F, it could easily reach 100F in an apartment with no AC, and even if the nighttime low is 62F an apartment might only cool down to 75F overnight before heating up again the next day. And we haven't had high temps below 85F for over a week now. 

Living in that kind of heat is miserable for 3-4 days, and increasingly stressful the longer it stays hot. It's hard to sleep well when it's hot, and prolonged sleep deprivation is definitely a health hazard (both physically and mentally). 

While there may be people in the South who are acclimated to high heat and humidity and can work all day in it, Seattleites generally are not. We're more likely to be people who consider 55F to be t-shirt weather, while Southerners are shivering.

"&gt; The main request is light rail from Ballard to West Seattle.

Actually, I think the request is to serve Ballard *and* West Seattle. Most folks are going to use it to go from their home to work, which is likely downtown. Personally, I'd rather the Ballard line continue to the Airport, but I'll take whatever I can get. 

The 99th/Harrison stop doesn't make much sense to me. I'd rather see one in LQA/Seattle Center, ideally next to Key Arena, especially since the line would pass directly under it. The 99th/Harrison area isn't pedestrian friendly, and it's only 3 blocks from the Denny stop. 

Also, extending the line to 65th is awesome. This will make it significantly more useful to people in Ballard. I've seen so many proposals where the Ballard line stops at 15th and Market, ignoring the fact that most people in Ballard live way north of there. It would be even more awesome to extend the line up 15th even more to 85th(or further), essentially replacing the RapidRide D Line, but that would be a future project.

I say ""was"" a skilled biker not because he died, but because he suffered such extensive damage he'll never ride again. Was in a coma for a few days even. Luckily the cab didn't flee the scene in his case.

It's amazing to me just how oblivious some people are though.

"In a doomsday scenario, of course there will be destruction, and people will die, and it will be a tragedy. But we are not helpless; there is a lot we can do right now to minimize loss of life and property if such an event occurs. And to clarify, I'm not an expert in this area, but there are a number of things I can think of off the top of my head which seem reasonable. 

The first and most important are public education. People who live or develop the west cost of the Olympic Penninsula and other highly vulnerable areas should know that they are doing so at their own peril. People living in other areas should know what will happen and what to do if there is a disaster. 

There should be well known evacuation routes, shelters, and public meeting points in less vulnerable areas. There should be early warning systems in place, such as sirens, text messages, television alerts, email, etc. 

Building codes should be updated to withstand seismic activity. Older structures can be retrofitted. 

People should create emergency plans with their families so they know what to do if there is an emergency. People should have a reasonable amount of supplies in case there is a disaster, such as a weeks worth of food, water, and gas. 

Not everybody has a car. There should be public transit contingencies for various disaster scenarios. How will King County Metro operate if there is a significant disaster? 

Utility companies can retrofit their infrastructure to make it more robust. Redundancy should be built in and existing infrastructure can be hardened. Plans can be made in advance for emergency scenarios. For example, if disaster strikes Seattle, can we draw repair crews from Portland, Spokane, and Vancouver? That can be coordinated now. 

Emergency response teams can be trained and prepared for such events. Disaster simulations and drills can be coordinated between agencies. We can ensure they have the tools and infrastructure to operate and communicate if there is a disaster. 

At a state and federal we can make sure critical infrastructure such as bridges and highways are robust enough to withstand a disaster event, so that people and supplies can get into and out of the affected areas. 

All of these sound reasonable to me, and I'm sure more can be done.

"There are a lot of reasons. Some are political problems, some are perception issues. Not all of them are reasonable, but most are.

* First, we aren't really building 'light rail' the same way most cities do. We're building a system with more than double the capacity of and vastly more reliability than traditional light rail; we just happen to be using light rail vehicles. Building tunnels and elevated sections where we need them really means we're building more of a subway.

* The cost isn't that high anyway. The local media doesn't have the time or energy to make sure their cost comparisons are correct. They'll compare different years' dollars, for instance, or use year of expenditure dollars (including a lot of inflation) and interest payments when talking about the cost of our system, but use numbers from other agencies that don't have those built in.

* The time it takes is similar to other systems of similar complexity in the US through corridors of similar density in similar political situations. The fundamental ways government is laid out in Washington cause loooong political timelines and very limited availability of public dollars. We are Dillon rule rather than home rule, so counties and cities and regional transportation districts have to play games with state government to share benefit with rural and suburban areas across the state in order to get anything at all. 

* Most systems don't have to get local money entirely from a public vote. Voters almost always trade a lower tax rate for a longer implementation timeline - hyperbolic discounting at its best - so we add years from that alone. Because we've been getting sales tax, which is unpredictable, and these projects are long enough to be impacted by real estate and economic cycles, we see even more delay from downturns.

* Sound Transit doesn't have any inherent incentive to build quickly or operate cheaply. They aren't building systems to be profitable, they're building them to meet the demands of their board, who in turn represent constituencies with all sorts of their own desires. A lot of those constituents don't even want transit - that doesn't disappear just because of a vote. East Link, for instance, was delayed further by lawsuits. It's not in Sound Transit's best interest to even point this out publicly, as it risks them looking like they're at odds with constituents.

When people get angry at Sound Transit, they also tend to damage to efforts to improve these situations. It's tough to fix.",false,false,t1_cst2a45,Bensch,Downtown,0,1436124523,t5_2qhad,t3_3c7m0o,t1_cst07ra,28,1437609666,0,0,cst2a45,Seattle,28,,flair

"Wow, get over yourself.  As someone who works next to a busy duck route, I can understand a little mild annoyance.  They have a pretty set routine, so if you're in the same place and within earshot, chances are you'll hear the same song blasting over the speakers and the same corny jokes delivered on cue every time.  One day a sat outside for lunch and counted 11 in the time it took me to finish my sandwich.  

But I want to tell a different perspective of the ducks, and that is of the rider.  My work raffled off free rides on the ducks once, and I was the lucky winner.  I waited for some friends or family from out of town I could give them to, but with the expiration looming, I decided to play tourist and take the ride myself.  What stood out for me wasn't the sights (I've lived here nearly all my life) or the commentary (""Want to know a great place for coffee?  Try Starbucks!""), it was the people.  Everywhere we went people would wave at the ducks.  One guy memorably shouted ""Woo!  Ducks!!!  You guys ROCK!""  I realized that the ducks weren't just showing off the sights of Seattle, they were showing what kind of people we are too.

"I support the city’s right to choose rent control for itself -- it’s patronizing that a decades-old state law would take away the power of Seattle to make housing policy for ourselves. That said, I think the details of whatever we’re calling “Rent Control” are far more important than the generic concept, and I’ve seen a lot of vague proposals tossed around this campaign without many details. I do think that we have an awful lot of examples of rent control policies failing to prevent rent hikes except for a lucky few who get cheap rent (NYC and SF for instance). Ultimately, it seems unlikely that a rent control policy would come together especially quickly anyway, which suggests to me that we should look at every other mechanism at our disposal to increase supply and bring down rent.

On lake washington boulevard, if I completely hug the edge of the pavement, it is STILL not ""safe space to pass"".  The roadway there is narrow enough that no matter where I go or what I do, my position on the lane doesn't change the fact that you must move into the opposite lane to make a safe pass there.

You basically just proved my point - it clearly matters to you that I move over to the right - and the only way this matters is if you want to make unsafe, close passes.  Otherwise, where I am in the lane makes no difference whatsoever.

So, OP, there you have it - one of the people I'm talking about proving my point.  Move to the right and people like this will pass you with inches to spare so they can stay in the lane.

""Courtesy,"" as he calls it, to people like this - people willing to risk your life so they can pass you 15 seconds earlier than if they just waited for the other lane to clear - is NOT worth giving up your safety for.

Since the mid-1970s, an average of three or four fatalities has occurred each summer in Seattle. During excessively warm summers, such as the summer of 1992, up to 50 to 60 deaths have occurred.

Seattle's typical cool summers result in a population that is less acclimatized to extreme heat compared with that of many other cities in the United States. Health effects associated with heat begin in Seattle at lower temperatures than many other places; the relative temperature compared to seasonal normals is often more important than the actual temperature. Seattle is among the cities with the highest heat sensitivity in the country.

Heat cramps, heat exhaustion and heat stroke are examples of negative health effects associated with both average warmer summer temperatures and temperature extremes.

In Seattle, most fatalities are indirectly caused by heat, e.g., heart attacks, strokes and respiratory illness.

Climate research shows that extreme heat events have become more frequent and severe in the Pacific Northwest in recent decades, and climate models project that this trend will continue in the future.",false,false,t1_csrz808,jordanlund,,0,1436021777,t5_2qhad,t3_3c2s3z,t1_csryndc,12,1440500963,0,0,csrz808,Seattle,12,,

"It's an awkward but very important issue for us. The area has grown a ton over the last 20 years. This is really another aspect of city planning that Seattle skipped until it was 10 years past due. Workers who rent in the city are likely working in the city. They likely work in places that serve the higher paid workers and tenants. If we start to push those people out of the city by raising rents, people in the city will either have to pay more for services so that those same people can afford to continue to live in the city or risk that those workers will simply move away and work in the suburbs instead. If we push that work out of the city then we risk having the higher paid workers also move out of the city center to follow the service they no longer have access to. 

It's nebulous for sure but we see examples of hollow city centers with no sense of culture around the US. Seattle has time to fix this if they are careful about it.

"A little perspective...

Okay, the article claims there are ""4,300 foreclosed homes from Everett to Tacoma that are now owned by banks"" that are ""just sitting around.""

First, I'm not sure where they are getting that number because they do not cite a source. [If the data comes from RealtyTrac, I find it highly suspect](http://seattlebubble.com/blog/2013/10/04/realtytrac-vampire-reo-nonsense/).

Second, some other data is necessary to get proper perspective on that number, assuming it is legitimate. Keep in mind that they appear to be talking about the entire King/Snohomish/Pierce County area, so 4,300 homes really isn't all that many.

Just last month 6,472 homes sold in the three counties, and there were 9,710 homes on the market at the end of the month (source: NWMLS). That means ""months of supply"" was 9710/6472= 1.5. Six months of supply is considered a ""balanced market"" (favors neither home buyers nor home sellers). If we added 4,300 homes to the market months of supply would increase all the way to... **2.2**. Still firmly in seller's market territory.

Also, even if we assume that 4,300 homes are currently owned by the banks in King/Snohomish/Pierce, it doesn't mean that they are ""just sitting around."" The [foreclosure process in Washington state](http://seattlebubble.com/blog/2013/10/03/foreclosure-timeline-washington-state/) takes a *minimum* of 281 days. [Last month](http://seattlebubble.com/blog/2015/07/03/june-stats-preview-sales-spike-up-sharply/) 132 homes were repossessed by banks in King County. Assuming Snohomish and Pierce saw similar volume, that means around 390 homes a month being foreclosed. Even if the foreclosure process were 100% efficient (which we know it is not), a minimum of 1,170 homes would be bank-owned in the area at any given time, just progressing normally through the process.

Now a comment: Burj Dubai would never be built in the US because it's more showmanship than actual return on investment.

The Sears Tower in Chicago has 418,064 m² of leasable floor space -- while the Burj only has 517,240 m², despite being much taller.  So, you're adding all this elevator and HVAC complexity and expense with the height, when it only gets you 25% more leasable space.  The top 200m (about 25% of the height) is an unoccupied spire - the last floor is under 600m - so there's no return on investment there at all.  It certainly is pretty though, but boxes make money, so we get boxes in the US.

There's also the fact that we don't have (effectively) slave labor like Dubai does.  The Burj cost $1.5 billion vs $4 billion for the new 1WTC.

"&gt; housing does not follow presumed economic law.

I believe the phrase you seek is that housing is not fungible.  Gasoline, for instance, is.  The (regulated) supply of gasoline means that it is irrelevant whether I buy from am/pm or Chevron.  I can choose solely on price and no other consideration.  Food, by and large, is also fungible, though the market has created some other optional things I can consider (organic, free range, prepackaged, and so on) but a tomato is still a tomato.

On the other hand, residences may have different properties (jetted tub, backyard, fitness center, close to a well-served bus stop, view) but they are ultimately non-optional and non-interchangable.  If I work for an employer in King County, that's all well and good that there is a house that has the exact features I want in Portland; I can't buy it.

"I was at Amazon for about a year and a half, just missing out on that sweet 2nd year stock vesting :( I was a systems engineer in a really good group that had a lot of ex-Microsoft people, so the culture in my group wasn't very Amazonian with the long hours and everything. Like everywhere else, there's a mix of brilliant and awesome people and then there are some awesomely bad people too, for example a coworker that seemed really smart but would work long hours and skip lunch to do repetitive, tedious tasks (come on dude, automate that shit). The management changes over the years weren't great and I had a really bad manager for way longer than I should have, which is most of the reason I left. 

The positives for working at Amazon are that it looks good on a resume and they pay really well (at least up to $125k or so I hear, and then they just give more stock rather than more salary). If you can get into a good group that doesn't go crazy with the weekend work expectations, then its just like any other company. 

The downsides are that we had no path for promotion. It was expected that you singlehandedly recruit people from other teams to help you with your projects and that is how you advance yourself, everyone scrambling to get people under them like a big pyramid scheme. If you couldn't do that, then you could just take a job a Microsoft and get a promotion that way (I hear they don't enforce the 18 month non-compete contracts unless you are director level or higher if at all). Most people chose this, and one guy went from middle manager to Partner level at Microsoft in a few years just by bouncing back and forth. 

What I miss about Amazon is the honest drive for excellence across the board, whether from pride in your service or fear of getting ripped a new one. I liked the weekly ops meetings where a VP would drill down into every issue and ask big questions to find out what stupid things were done and how we were never going to repeat these mistakes. Everywhere else I see VPs insulate themselves from the details, so there is no ""oh shit"" pressure on getting something fixed or done right the first time. Its not micromanaging though, it was all about putting ownership on the service teams and pressuring them to develop plans and answer questions. The leadership principles, as bullshit as they can be sometimes (frugality lol), would be a big improvement for my current company. The hiring loops and bar raisers seem like they would be a good idea everywhere, but in reality we don't draw the kind of applicants that Amazon does and can't offer salaries to match so we take what we can get.

I guess all in all, I'm glad I got to work there and not get burned by a terrible group, but I'm happy since it was getting slightly worse for me over time. ",false,false,t1_cszxreg,examznthrawy,,0,1436642439,t5_2qhad,t3_3cxmdm,t3_3cxmdm,19,1437776825,0,0,cszxreg,Seattle,19,,

"&gt; But climate change isn't happening /s

Whether or not climate change is happening, these local extremes are not indicators of human-caused climate change.  Climate change is long, slow change over time - fractions of a degree over many years.

From our very own Cliff Mass:

&gt; the warmth is predominantly the result of natural variability.  That is, not being caused by human emissions of greenhouse gases.

&gt; the more extreme the weather anomaly, the less likely it is to be caused by human-induced (anthropogenic) global warming

"So, the Freakonomics guys are really fun. They're smart, entertaining, and write good work explaining to most people economic theories. The major foundation in their statement that tipping should be banned, is that it hides the real cost of the labor from he employer, passing it off to the consumer.

The thing is, the cost would be passed to the consumer anyways once a new equilibrium for the price of labor is established. So that's one thing.

The bigger thing is, and this is not covered in remedial economics, there are systems in play in the world that are the accepted rules by society, we call it institutional framework. An example of this is the speed limit on the freeway. The legal limit is 60MPH and you're not supposed to go over it, legally. But everyone drives about 5MPH over, and even the legal enforcement allows for this. So on a narrow highway, who is in the right? Someone driving 59MPH, because it's the legal limit? Or are the people stuck behind him, furious about his slow speed right for demanding he go faster? The answer is actually the people stuck behind the guy are right.

And thus, with tipping, it's understood you should tip, it's a social convention that's understood as part of what you pay for your meal. If it's understood no one will tip, pay would align appropriately. To be the only one who doesn't tip, makes you an asshole who's breaking societal rules and harming the waiter.",false,false,t1_cszxlwy,Cataclyst,Capitol Hill,0,1436642139,t5_2qhad,t3_3cwt9g,t1_csztgvl,37,1440485932,0,0,cszxlwy,Seattle,37,,flair

edit: I think its far far more likely that you will see the capacity of the roads reduced so much by inattentive people using their cell phones and driving in Seattle that you will no longer be able to get anywhere, because most of the time, people not going on green, etc. is people on their phones.

"This is about economics, not philosophy. It has nothing to do with altruism or rich people ""wanting"" to help poor people. Housing policies change incentives for developers and landlords, and those changes impact what they build and what they charge. 

Rent control effectively makes some portion of housing stock cheaper than it ""should be"" (""should be"" relative to a free market), and as a result of constraining the rent-controlled portion of the market, it makes everything that's not rent-controlled a little more expensive than it ""should be"" (because supply is more constrained but demand hasn't changed at all). So people lucky enough to live in rent control units are feeling good, but everyone else (rich or poor) is a little more screwed. There is no way around this in a capitalist system.

"Tim is a good man and has done a good job of living up to the current expectations of a Seattle City Councilperson. While his constant advocacy for the tunnel is a black mark on his record, he is otherwise a devoted incrementalist in the Seattle style, and he’s running on that record. At no point in his term has he shown the urgency that real people feel on the streets with regard to transportation funding, housing, or public safety. He has been on council for 8 years, served as council president and budget chair, is the top fundraiser out of all 47 candidates, and yet in a poll last month 46% of respondents either [didn’t know who he was or didn’t have an opinion on him](http://www.seattlemet.com/articles/2015/7/15/poll-sawant-has-high-unfavorable-rating-citywide-murray-remains-very-popular-burgess-below-50). I think public representatives should be more willing to engage the public and voice their opinions, more willing to take a stand for things. Last week Tim backed away from a very important discussion on the exclusionary roots of single family housing because his donors were upset. I understand the political rationale, and it’s a good sign that he’s listening to people, but he obviously didn’t have conviction about that plan and now we’re back to where we started.

Consider your egress and heavy things stacked up high. Bookcases and free standing cabinets should be bolted to the wall so that if they do fall, they don't fall in such a way as to prevent entrance or exit from a building. Not to mention having one fall on you.

One of my neighbors had a 1900s era craftsman foundation retrofit to the tune of around 6-8k. I'm more DIY.

In addition to the bolts, you should have 5-ply plywood ""Structural Grade 1"" plywood on the pony wall in the basement that should be nailed with real nails or with construction staples. Not screws. Not finish nails. Not bargain basement deal whatever nails. The details matter a ton. Dunn lumber sells structural grade 1. Home depot does not (but they do sell 5 ply).

The bike lanes *are* there for your protection, as well as the protection of drivers. Unfortunately, from what I have seen since they were opened, they are not well designed. The setup is confusing, the signage is not great, and their are far too many ""non daily"" drivers (tourists, people going to appointments, games,etc) who are not familiar with the new setup to be as safe as intended.

"I ride the bus every day, and I still agree with every comment you made except for low level of service (depends where you live, of course) and infrequent pickup times.


That said, I believe the solution to the ""slower than driving"" problem is to reduce the stop frequency (express buses, Light Rail, for instance) and also create grade separated or transit-only lanes. Everyone (including car-only people) benefit from the choices that bus riders make, since those choices effectively reduce pollution in our city air and traffic on our streets and parking problems for cars. A strong public transit system also lets apartments use less parking, which in turn lowers the cost of housing for everyone. (apartment underground parking spaces cost ~$30,000 per parking space).


There are exciting and radical proposals for how we can move Seattle from a suburban bus route schedule to an urban bus route schedule. Thanks to increasing density and a multipolar city, it's possible for us to increase service (hours, frequency, and make buses faster) and simplify routes. Check out [this example](http://seattletransitblog.com/2014/03/10/why-we-restructure-a-bit-more-about-bus-2/) of how restructuring is hard and the benefits it can offer.

"I'd politely disagree. 

In a perfect world we would be able to say ""no more than this much can be charged!"". But we don't live in a perfect world at all. In my opinion there is hardly a ""good"" form of rent control because in the end, due to the failures in the past with rent control programs, it discourages builders from building new apartments. Which is the exact issue we're in right now.

I think my favourite article articulating the economic issues (without even mentioning SFO or Cali once!) would be [this one](http://fee.org/freeman/detail/the-case-against-rent-control)

What the city instead needs to focus on is reform for density and building codes. Got more people coming to your city? Stack em on top of each other where you can. Make housing readily available and plentiful, and you'll see prices drop. Immediately? Absolutely not. Supply and demand is a cruel beast.

"Actually the evidence for that specific kind of quake 'contagion' is minimal.  A San Andreas quake would be lower on the Richter scale, and LA is far better prepared, so damage would be an order of magnitude less catastrophic even if it happened.

Secondly, it seems you have quite a naive view of business. The millions of people who use windows or drink Starbucks everyday around the world couldn't care less about Seattle.  And companies won't wait (as the article suggests) six months to get electricity, which is pretty required to run a business.  The rest of the world keeps moving.  The CEO, executive team, marketing staff, finance guys, lawyers, etc... will need to keep doing their jobs.  In the 21st century, these companies can move to any office block in the western hemisphere and be ready to work within a week- there is no 'heavy equipment'.   Their data centres and warehouses are already spread across the globe. 

Seattle is a tech hub because tech workers like to live there.  New hubs can spring up overnight, and will, if Seattle collapses.  Tech is one of the fastest industries there is- people wont wait around.  They'll move, quickly and robustly, wherever they want.  And Seattle will be worse off for it.  

Sure, you may have a naive 'day after tomorrow' fantasy of staying to rebuild, but after seeing the city destroyed, no power, no food, no jobs, your kids getting educated in some shitty temporary school housed in a shipping container exposed to the cold and rain, crime rates gone up massively due to increased poverty, and all your favourite places closed up or destroyed, and you might think again.  Christchurch is the second biggest city in New Zealand, and yet three years after their modest quake (in which less than 100 people died) their city centre is still destroyed and they estimate it'll be another three years before it even approaches normality again.

"Do it, for yourself and for the sake of all others run down on their bicycles. This happened to me in 2004 in California.

Of course, they didn't want to hand over a penny as I was not technically in a car. But my lawyer fought that tooth and nail and got me $10,000.

I said fuck it to the 15k I still owed to the main hospital I was brought to (they tried to downplay my injury and claimed I didn't need a lawyer) And so I bought a laptop, DSLR and went to Europe twice once I could walk somewhat better a year later. 11 years later, sitting is still a literal pain in the ass.

"13,000 if it strikes in the morning in February.   If it strikes in the middle of the day in Summer it basically implies that hundreds of thousands of people could die.  

And even if 'only' 20,000 people or whatever die in the earthquake, and the tsunami, and the fires that will almost definitely destroy the city, the entire economy will be destroyed for decades.   The big employers like Microsoft, Starbucks, Amazon, Costco, the banks/service companies etc will leave right away, moving to temporary office space in other parts of the country as their shareholders demand they get operations back in line.  Sure, maybe they'll say that one day they return, but ten years later when their staff are settled in Austin or Phoenix or Columbus or Charlotte or wherever else, they won't want to move 'home'.   

And when those companies leave, so do all the secondary businesses that service them.  The cleaners and janitors and caterers and coffee-shop employees, the hotels and restaurants and malls and movie theatres those companies and their employees rely on.  As tax revenue plummets when anyone wealthy enough to afford to be able to leave goes, and property tax revenue collapses as home values fall into the ground, the government can't afford to hire street cleaners or highway maintenance staff or teachers or local government employees anymore.  And very quickly the whole region spirals into economic recession and mass joblessness that could last an entire generation, even with large amounts of federal government assistance.

"I am a programmer who used to work for Microsoft in Seattle and who now lives in NYC.  

I can confirm that your cost of living will decrease significantly moving to Seattle.  Almost everything is cheaper.  Food, drinks, clothing, rent, etc.  

Your current rent in NYC being $1525 is really low for NYC as I'm sure you know; I doubt you'll be able to pay significantly less than that in Seattle.  Plus you'll probably want to get a car as Seattle's public transportation is nothing compared to NYC's.

My advice is you and your SO should THINK REALLY HARD about whether to do this move.  

Here are my reasons:

* Your opportunities in the arts will be _severely_ limited in Seattle as compared to NYC, whereas your SO's opportunities as a programmer are great in NYC.  There is a tech hiring boom all over the city.  Getting a job should be like falling off a log for him.  Why doesn't your SO apply to companies in NYC like Google, Twitter, Facebook, and Dropbox, which all have NYC offices?  There are a ton more beyond those big names too.

* There is a greater diversity of people in NYC.  Every male in Seattle is a computer programmer.  I exaggerate, but not by much.  In NYC, you have the douchey hedge fund guys for sure, but you also have the artists, and the lawyers, and the rabbis, etc.

* For your SO, there is a much larger startup tech community out in NYC than in Seattle.  So there's greater potential for him if he wants to go that route someday.  The tech community in NYC is also younger.

* Your NYC rent is way cheap.  As a result, your Seattle cost of living won't be as significant a decrease for you as it might be for others.  If you have some sort of rent control or something, that is a huge advantage that you are enjoying in NYC.

* Microsoft is one of the only big tech companies that routinely does layoffs.  There is a stench at the company; it is dying.  If you're at the beginning of a promising career I would caution you to choose Microsoft as a last resort, only when the other avenues fail.

"Did you read the rest of the article? It addresses many more issues than the random quote OP chose for the headline, such as:

The city refusing to collect basic rental unit data so as to not ""burden"" landowners:

&gt; “Because it represents a comprehensive survey of all rental property owners in the city,” they wrote, “the RRIO could offer ‘gold-standard’ data about housing affordability, rental dynamics, and policy initiatives.”

[...]

&gt; When I asked DPD spokesperson Bryan Stevens why, he explained that the change “was out of scope, would generate stakeholder opposition, would be difficult to implement, and would generate data of questionable quality.” Remember, we’re talking about asking landlords to do some basic math.

How landlords use predatory rental hikes to avoid having to pay city-mandated displacement fees when rehabbing:

&gt; Since 1990, the city’s Tenant Relocation Assistance Ordinance has mandated that building owners who plan to demolish or significantly rehab an existing property pay $3,255 in relocation costs to displaced tenants who make less than 50 percent of the city’s median income. (The city foots half of the bill.) Yet Licata’s office has found—at least anecdotally—that many landlords circumvent the process by raising rents so high that low-income tenants have no choice but to move out. And once they’re gone, then the renovations start. Licata’s ordinance would strengthen TRAO by assessing a $1,000 fine, per day, if a landlord begins rehabbing the building within 90 days of a rent hike. 

And finally, how there *is* much more to the public policy of housing and land ownership than just ""supply and demand"":

&gt;“The free market, property rights, and a need to create a socially diverse community—I would suggest that all of those are social constructs. They’re really just abstractions. They’re not actually truths in and of themselves.” That’s Dr. Branden Born, an associate professor of urban design and planning at the UW. Put another way, he’s saying that property rights aren’t inalienable—we’ve just come to believe that they are, after decades of living in a society that values capital above all else.

&gt; And freed from that thinking, he says, it’s possible to start imagining a scenario in which housing vouchers are available for more than just the poorest of the poor, or in which the owner of an apartment building that sells for tens of millions of dollars has to share a portion of the proceeds with the taxpayers who funded the roads and parks and other amenities that made it so valuable in the first place.

"An anti-""philosophical tantrum"" tantrum by /u/somenewuser, 2015:

I almost wrote ""it's not that I don't care, it's..."" but then I realized I couldn't complete the sentence after that last word.  Because I've been turned into someone who, as it turns out, actually doesn't care.  I'm tired of being shit on because I bought a run down house in the Central Area that nobody wanted for almost eight years and fixed it up but because I'm white and work for a technology company none of that matters, I'm an evil gentrifier.

I'm tired of ""oh we have to save this amazing rundown hellhole of a bar"" or ""we can't build that dense, urban thing because two people who lived here just before you did object"" being the cause celebre.  Fuck that, build the light rails and the streetcars and the trolleybuses and the six-story modern-style buildings with retail at the bottom that are places to shop beyond a tiny Post Office or places to eat besides a talk-show-host-adored fried chicken place or a sandwich shop that couldn't pass a health code inspection if it wasn't warned in advance.

I'm annoyed at ""community groups"" sending me flyers telling me how they're ""looking out"" for my interests and dunning me for money, all while trying to spook a huge local employer into not expanding because ""they should be good neighbors.""  And the companion of folks who race to the local news to talk about being ""pushed out of the area"" by *evil* developers when a simple search of property records shows that all of the people being interviewed sold their houses for hundreds of thousands of dollars and bought different ones in different locations (that cost more in property taxes than the one they sold), so they had the voluntary choice to stay or go and they left.

And, last, I'm done with the prevailing view of ""this place was so awesome starting five minutes after I got here and it's been going downhill ever since.""  Like /u/p_nathan said, people have been ""displacing"" people for thousands of years.  Yes, we need to do a better job of building dense urban places--but we **can't** because the NIMBYs who object to anything taller than a mailbox post combine forces with the *it must always be the same now and forever* and this is what you get when those two mix in the same pot of boiling jealousy.

"Unfortunately this is going to get downvoted to all hell (hence the throw away), but in the midst of all this Amazon bashing I need to chime in with my personal experience.

I've been at Amazon for a little while now, and you know what I see? The same damn shit I see at other tech companies. All my friends at Google and Microsoft work long hours just like all the Amazon horror stories go. Good friend of mine at Microsoft works most weekends. He may duck out early here and there, but there are many evenings when he's headed back into the office to get some work done. The long hours exist fucking everywhere... just no one in Seattle is bashing other companies because they haven't ""gentrified"" Cap Hill like Amazon has.

Oh, and that signing bonus... worried about the liability? DON'T FUCKING TAKE IT! Everyone's able to renegotiate their compensation plan to adjust more base pay, stock, or bonus before they accept their offer. Don't care about stock and bonus? Tell your recruiter and you'll have your base pay adjusted. It's not going to be a 1 to 1 exchange, but you're trading one time payments for a bump in annual salary.

While I'd like to say that making it through an Amazon loop would get you through every tech company's interview process, I seriously doubt that's true. Due to the nature of my work, I interface with people from all over the company, and there are definitely people that should not have been hired, and managers still have jobs that definitely shouldn't be around. If you have other offers at other companies, great! You have some choices to make. If I had to choose between Amazon, Google, or Facebook, no fucking way would I choose to move to the Bay Area and their outrageous rent and cost of living, not to mention the complete lack of non-desert nature in the immediate vicinity.

Personally, I work a mostly 9-5 schedule. Everyone up to my VP is awesome. I don't know my VP that well, but he's friendly enough to come by every so often and see how the troops are doing. My manager is constantly making sure team morale is in check (which it always is because I work with a fantastic group of people). I don't see myself leaving Amazon any time soon.

And to OP, if you hate Amazon so much to make a post like this, fucking leave the company you damn hypocrite. If you're good enough to pass the bar at other tech companies, then interview there, and move your ass out of Seattle. If you've been with the company ""way too long,"" that would also mean you've been earning way too much stock with your yearly stock grants on 2 year vestment schedules. Or hey, how about this... why don't you actually be a decent manager (if you've been here so long, I certainly hope you'd have become one by now) and actually give a damn about your employees. At the end of the day, that's what the manager is SUPPOSED to do. Don't want your employee's burning out? DON'T OVERWORK THEM! It's your job to throttle incoming work to an appropriate level, and to ensure that your staffing needs are met in yearly budget meetings.

"Contrary to what you might assume from this sub (particularly this thread), Seattle is not entirely populated by assholes.  A lot of the suggestions you're getting here, in case you haven't figured it out, are meant to be funny to people who know the area.

If he wants to stay in a neighborhood where people his age like to play, try Capitol Hill, or maybe Belltown--lots of nightlife there.  Fremont, Ballard, Queen Anne, or the University District would also work.  He won't need a car to get around from any of those locations (and probably won't want one, since parking it will be a pain, and expensive).  If he has other interests he wants to explore...we could make better suggestions if we knew what those were.

And I'll add my warning to the others:  he shouldn't move here without a job, unless he--or you--are prepared to dig deep into savings while he finds one.  The local economy is in pretty good shape, and some fields (tech, tech, and tech) are doing a lot of hiring, but even if that's what he does, I would have something lined up first.  If he's in most other fields, double that warning.  Seattle has become a wildly popular place for young people to move, so there's a LOT of competition for entry-level jobs.  Plus, the cost of housing here has gone through the roof, especially in the neighborhoods above, because they're popular with young, affluent transplants.

"Saturday, August 29, 8:30 p.m. - The H.P. Pubcraft Lovecrawl

Three years ago, I had the crazy idea to create a pubcrawl and megagame in my favorite Seattle neighborhood - Ballard. Honestly, I can't believe we're already in the third year of the H.P. Pubcraft Lovecrawl.

This year, crawlers will assume a specific role in the setting of Lovecraftian Carcosa, and will become locked in an cosmic battle between cultists and investigators. The night is designed to encourage interaction, so it's a great place to meet new people and make new friends.

You could be a hero. You could be a double-agent. You could go insane. Your choices will have a real impact on the outcome of the night. Will the cultists assume power? Or will good unleash its light on the barren landscape of lost Carcosa?

The fully-baked adventure starts at Hilliard's Brewery on Saturday, August 29 at 8:30. There, you'll assume your identity, organize your team, and start your adventure. The night will take you on a harrowing journey of epic importance (and epic ichor consumption). Save Seattle! Save the multiverse! There will be prizes!

We are selling tickets this year to cover costs and make the event as awesome as possible. All ticket proceeds will go directly into the event. I have a detailed budget for anyone who'd like to see it, but the basic breakdown is this: 70% of the budget goes to prizes and giveaways, 20% goes to pubcrawl and megagame supplies, and 10% will be reserved for incidentals. Any money left over after the event will be donated to Child's Play. General admission tickets are six bucks.

Tickets are available [here](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/3rd-annual-hp-pubcraft-lovecrawl-tickets-17571956194).

* After 20 years, who wants to be taken down by an illegal arrest? This implies the officers he represent would much rather be taken down by going on a rampage in a minority area and ending up on international news first.

* Illegal arrest above: Smith has GOT to know that the burden of evidence here is not on the city. She has to prove that she had cause to arrest/detain/harrass this guy, because by not doing so she potentially broke constitutional law on illegal search and seizure, and every video I've seen shows no evidence or proof of any of this. 

* Even if the evidence didn't clearly show that she acted unprofessionally, the fact she's been a cop for 20 years is even scarier.

"My mother is a nurse at a Swedish hospital. Swedish does not treat their employees well. They recently took away a benefit that was in their contract, but did not tell the hospital employees, until they start to notice that they are not accruing PTO as they previously were. 

There was also a fire at one of the hospitals recently, on one of the basement levels where the operating suites are. The electrical fire was caused when old hospital beds caught fire that were improperly stored in the electrical room when hospital management did not want to dispose of them properly. The OR began to fill with smoke, and patients had to be evacuated. 

This organization has issues and the employees are not happy, thus they are picketing. 

Hospitals have the ultimate leverage over employees though, as they are under an oath to take care of sick people. They can not legally or morally walk away from their job, or they would break the oath. The hospital management knows this and takes advantage of its employees. 

Edit: I forgot to mention how big a problem staffing is in the hospital where my mother works as well. Positions have been gotten rid of, and the work load has been put onto the remaining workers.

"This. 

My family owns/operates a small apartment building in East Lake Union. We are super reasonable landlords AND animal lovers, but it's not about you, per se. Your dogs sound great, but it's more that about those who have come before you. Even if your dogs are perfectly trained, accidents/illness happen and they tend to leave nasty stains/marks. And that's closer to the best case scenario, realistically speaking.

Those stains make it hard to rent out the building in the future so we will pay hundreds (or more) to fix these issues as they pop up. When we look at a group of applicants, there's virtually no reason we'd rent to a potential tenant with animals when compared to a reasonably similar applicant with no animals. (And let's face it, you're seeing probably dozens of applicants for a single unit in the current climate). It's also a disservice to the tenants we have in the building, many of whom we've developed close relationships with over the years. We're not going to risk alienating current tenants who we like by letting in 3 dogs we simply don't know or trust. 

Sorry, but it's just not worth it. 

My recommendation would be to look further away from the center of the city. I'm talking serious suburb action here, since there are effectively no vacancies in the city limits for someone with 3 dogs. It sucks this issue didn't crop up until you set foot in the city, but this isn't really unique to Seattle.

"Here's a brief primer as to why transit sucks so hard here.

In 1912 the Bogue Plan was voted down with 63% voting against. It was a comprehensive city plan that, among other things, would have built a rail rapid transit system throughout the city. Apparently it was voted down primarily because downtown business interests were afraid that the plan's new train terminal on the south shore of Lake Union would drive development from Downtown to the south side of Lake Union. This shift ended up happening anyway a century later but without high-capacity rail rapid transit. Hence the shitfest of traffic that chokes SLU every day.

In 1968 and 1970 the mass transit portion of Forward Thrust was voted down with 49% and 54% voting against, respectively. Even though the 1968 measure received 51% for, the bonds would have required 60% to be in favor, so it failed. The system would have largely been funded with federal money and would have created a citywide rail high capacity rapid transit system, but with the failure of the vote that money went to the transit mecca of Atlanta instead.

It was only in 1996 that we passed Sound Move to form Sound Transit. ST got off to a pretty rocky start (lots of overpromise, underdeliver), but they started to find their footing in the early 2000s and started to really get stuff done. Since then they've been rockin' and a rollin' (switched to underpromise, overdeliver).

Between the late 90s and last year there have also been six or so initiatives to extend the monorail. The Seattle Monorail Authority started up around the same time as ST, but after a few years and around $125 million dollars wasted they dissolved.

And that leaves us at today, where ST has left their initial dark days behind and are now kicking ass at actually building stuff. The problem is that in the interim of rejecting those previous proposals the Highway and Sprawl Era kicked into overdrive, so now there's a much bigger focus on building rail to the 'burbs instead of a comprehensive intracity system as compared to previous attempts.",false,false,t1_ct3gyko,shoeson,,0,1436912451,t5_2qhad,t3_3d9kal,t1_ct3dadg,40,1437856614,0,0,ct3gyko,Seattle,40,,

"I'm an Amazonian going on two years. I haven't felt this way **at all** about working for Amazon. I'd always worked in smaller companies and nonprofits in the past, and was extremely hesitant to take a position with them given the horror stories I've heard.

Instead, I've found it to be rewarding and the *best* work-life balance I've ever had. It's not just me, either: our entire team does a good job of working their eight hours and calling it a day. The tenure of my team skews longer; I'm probably one of the newer ones still. In fact, I have one coworker who I think we all *wish* would seek excellence elsewhere, who always seems miserable, and who nobody can seem to get rid of. I did nearly switch teams a while back due to some shuffling that was happening and the project I was on being unfulfilling, but was convinced to stay much to the chagrin of two other teams who were trying to get me to come work for them. 

I usually get to work between 7 and 8, and leave between 4 and 5. I employ a strict ""no nights or weekends"" rule (unless I'm on call, or am personally responsible for my project falling behind). 

I'm in AWS, not retail, and most of the teams I interact with have this feel to them. There are, of course, exceptions, and I've learned which teams I want to stay far away from. 

But no, this isn't a blanket company conspiracy; some managers are bad, and they can make a shitty experience for their team members. Other managers are good at what they do, and can allow you to build a fulfilling life at Amazon. 

&gt; I'm sure you will kick ass on your projects this year. Work hard but don't spend all night working. Leave at 5 or 6PM and go enjoy the city while you are here. While you are in the office pay close attention to the happiness and job satisfaction of your team mates.

"That afternoon I was watching the thunderstorms erupt over the Cascades from Gas Works Park while it was 97 degrees out. 

I've been in DC during the summer, where the heat index hit 122 in 2011 (104 air temp/77 dew point), and then after the derecho the year alter there were 11 days with temperatures over 95 and the dew point almost dipping below 70 (The year after *that*, DC set the record for earliest 90 degree day, when the high was 91 on April 10th). Still, 100 degrees with a 57 dew point, and 64-65 degree overnight lows, felt 18,000 times worse than anything the east coast threw at me. Probably because it had been 75 and sunny since late May, god damn acclimatization.

I think Seattle's climate swings are the best indicator that anthropogenic climate change is happening. 20 years ago, five consecutive 60 degree nights were extremely rare. 20 years ago, you'd be lucky to hear thunder five days a year in Seattle, and get a substantial storm (i.e. without much cloud to ground lightning) every 5 to 6 years. I think 1997 (a La Nina year) was when things started changing. Before then, the last major thunderstorm outbreak I could think of in the Puget Sound was way back in August of '93. Then they started happening every 3 or 4 years, and now, the Puget Sound is getting significant thunderstorm activity annually along with hot temperatures.

What is curious to me is that thunderstorms are starting to become more common no matter if it's El Nino, La Nina or a neutral year. See these examples:

1997-El Nino. Tornado outbreak on May 31st (one tornado hit Carnation), thunderstorms up in BC on July 6-8 and August 6

1999-La Nina. Thunderstorms in August in both Washington and BC

2008-La Nina. Thunderstorms on July 2-3 in Washington and Oregon

2009-El Nino. Thunderstorms up in BC, heat wave across the Northwest.

2012-La Nina. Thunderstorms all over the Northwest, including the July 20 heavy storms fuelled by Hurricane Fabio in the Pacific (Cliff Mass has a blog post on that)

2013-Neutral year. 10-11 days with thunder in Seattle.

2014-El Nino. Big storms on July 23rd, August 1-2, and 11-12. Seattle hit 96 degrees on August 11.

Not to mention the mountain pine beetles and nonexistant snowpacks that have contributed to cataclysmic fire seasons, such as in 1994, 2003 and 2014.

This is why I get wary when Cliff Mass tries to explain that extreme weather events aren't predicted by climate change models. Maybe not, but such events will increase in frequency and intensity because of climate change (although I think he admits that point). I don't want Dr. Mass to turn into a full on climate change denialer like Reddit's favorite TV meterologist, James Spann.

One thing I have always wanted to know: I understand why thunderstorms are rare west of the Cascades. However, I'd like to know the typical upper-air dynamic scenarios and preferred patterns of thunderstorms in the interior lowlands, both with respect to warm-core events (like August 11, 2014) and cold-core events (November 24, 2003), and why Portland gets more storms than Seattle, which gets more storms than Bellingham/Vancouver. I've emailed Dr. Mass and Scott Sistek over at KOMO, but didn't get a reply. You know how storm chasers use upper air analyses and other observational data (CAPE, helicity, etc.) out in the Plains?

"Seems backwards, doesn't it? To socialize secondary issues like medical care and standing armies, while ignoring the fundamental human needs of food, clothing and shelter and just leave it to ""business.""

In fact though, housing is partially socialized. Housing assistance, affordable housing and rent control programs are that. Subsidies, handouts, discounts and special legal protection given to housing developers and housing owners and managers are also that. The entire ""business"" of housing development and management is a government concern and is socialized at its root because most developers and management companies are some form of corporation or LLC, which is a grant of special legal protection by the state, against the people those companies defraud and mistreat, in exchange for a say in how the business is run, making it no longer a purely private enterprise but partially an interest of the state on paper and in law. As long as they want that special protection from liability (accountability) for their actions, the state has every right and obligation to enforce strict standards of operation on them and is negligent if it doesn't since that is meant to be the balance to limited liability - partial government management of industry. If legislation wasn't in the pockets of industry, this would in theory give the people control over these businesses, but that dream is negated by corruption.

If the relevant government clearly isn't going to enforce fair standards of practice on developers and property managers, the people should demand that their limit of liability be revoked so they can regulate these industries directly once again as in the past, instead of prayerfully hoping their corrupt ""representatives"" will do that job for them.",false,false,t1_cswelg9,MacThule,,0,1436377034,t5_2qhad,t3_3cjyef,t1_cswars6,-10,1437689617,0,0,cswelg9,Seattle,-10,,

&gt;A vital element in keeping the peace is our military establishment. Our arms must be mighty, ready for instant action, so that no potential aggressor may be tempted to risk his own destruction...

&gt;This conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms industry is new in the American experience. The total influence — economic, political, even spiritual — is felt in every city, every statehouse, every office of the federal government. We recognize the imperative need for this development. Yet we must not fail to comprehend its grave implications. Our toil, resources and livelihood are all involved; so is the very structure of our society. In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military–industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists, and will persist. We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes. We should take nothing for granted. Only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals so that security and liberty may prosper together.

"After spending a number of years at HP and being told, literally, 'we don't give a fuck about the customer all that matters is the profit margins' I was excited to be contacted by Amazon. I loved the idea of the tenants and the focus on creating new technologies to solve customer problems. I got a job on one of the core technical teams in AWS and moved across the country. My gf had to stay back to finish school and a job she had.

For the first year and a half everything was great. I learned lots of new things met lots of smart people. However this entire time my work was very limited to bug fixes and implementing minor customer requests. I really wanted to focus on customer facing issues and passed on a number of internal projects(mainly creating monitoring tools). This ended up hurting me when I thought I was doing what was best for 'the world's most customer centric company.' I saw some weird things like people abruptly leaving(this is an almost weekly occurrence at Amazon), people getting chewed out over really small things, and seeing teams filled with incompetent people who couldn't even solve the most basic issues. I always thought my team was safe but I was very wrong.

One of the first weird experiences was when a colleague was chewed out by multiple principle engineers for not being near his pager on the weekend when he wasn't on call. When I joined I was told about being on call and accepted it but was told there is a rotation and when your not on-call your not glued to your laptop. The team was told by the principle engineers and a few higher level managers that you are expected to always carry your pager and be available, even when your not on call. Another off putting thing is that many people at Amazon have an extreamly scewed sense of importance. This is mostly due to Amazon drumming down everyones throats they only higher the best. This leads to people in Amazon being very protective of their projects and not wanting to share anything about it.

So after being there for a year and a half and getting a great review for being the most customer centric person on the team I was given the go ahead to start implementing some new features for customers. Initially the team was on board and I was able to implement and test everything for release. This is where things started to go down hill. My feature was punted from release because 'the team needed more time to review' what they couldn't say. I had my second review where things went well but was told by my manager for me to be promoted I had to get the feature through. I started pushing hard but kept getting road blocks at every turn.

One thing you learn at Amazon is that your team is rated on your ticket queue and how fast you solve issues. So in order to make your team look good you need to minimize your ticket queue, and whats the best way to do that? Kill features. The group started rejecting every feature and did everything they could to stop customer facing features. Instead of working on things customers wanted the focus was turned to monitoring tools and testing. Management told this was to help improve quality but it really wasn't about that, its about creating busy work so we don't have to work on customer facing things that are ticketable. Some examples of things that the team spent their time on instead of customer facing features, rewriting the internal team only test tool 4 times, spending 8 months writing a tool that monitors that the files the team stored in S3 didn't dissapear(the team said S3 wasn't reliable for storing data but we still used it).

Simple customer requests are always met with opposition. A request came in for a feature that took me 15 minutes to implement, I sent it to my boss and instead of releasing it he spent two days with multiple team members(I was excluded) telling them why its too hard and couldn't be done. Even orders from Jeff were ignored because ""we're too busy right now."" While I still got to work on my feature I couldn't get it past any review. Every excuse was made, it got blocked at one point because I didn't have a test for echo.

I saw how many of our customers, including internal ones, were getting more and more frustrated with my team and started to show instances of how we were failing customers and could do better. Soon after I started raising these issues my PIP came in. There was nothing I could do because everything on my PIP was customer facing features and no one would review them.

On the bright side after I got fired I got a new job with a competitor with a 40% increase in salary.

"&gt;&gt;Our police should conduct themselves in a manner that establishes trust within the community and brings national attention to the department as a MODEL rather than a disgrace.

&gt;What would you say to the White House decision makers who recently recognized SPD as a model for nationwide police reform? Are they wrong?

We’re a model of how to respond to a Federal investigation, but we still have a long way to go before we are truly able to say: the future of urban policing is being pioneered in Seattle and the culture of the department has truly changed, not just in response to criticism, but because the police recognize that they are stewards of the community.

&gt;You have previously statements about police culture in Seattle. For example:

&gt;&gt;But despite the department’s diversity, “there’s still that sort of jock-y, vicious culture there,” Roderick said.

&gt;Have you ever done any ride alongs with SPD or spoken to any police officers? Do you personally know any police officers?

Oh my god, yes. I’ve lived in Seattle 25 years and when I was a younger man I suffered from substance abuse and lived for a couple of different periods on the streets of Seattle. I’ve been arrested and jailed, and have interacted with Seattle police in every conceivable way: as a perpetrator, as a crime victim, as an employee on Broadway, as a protester, as a driver and as a homeowner and father. I was tear-gassed twice during the WTO riots, but I have also known beat cops by name and have had friendly personal relationships with cops of all kinds. But I’m also a white male, and even when I was being arrested for vagrancy and property destruction I was never racially profiled. You can’t deny that it happens, and that cops here can have sharp elbows.

&gt;How have you gone about learning about police issues and police policy? Have you talked to any CPC members? The OPA auditor? Chief O'Toole? Det. Ron Smith?

I’ve had good meetings with Liz Campbell and Lisa Daugaard, and I’ve been to meetings of Career Bridge and met with community leaders. The police department has given me the cold shoulder so far, but I look very much forward to interacting more with the department. I am critical of the SPD but, probably more than most people, recognize the importance of the police and the difficulty of the job. It’s ok to criticize the police, and I understand that cops are defensive about it, but two of my best playmates from childhood are King County deputies and I get how hard it is. The brunt of the criticism often lands on beat cops, whereas it’s the whole system that needs reform, but criticism is healthy.

&gt;You have said SPD needs to do more about mental illness and drug addiction. As a police officer, why is it my job to deal with the mentally ill and the drug addicted? I wish these problems were handled before I got called to deal with them, because I view my job as dealing with criminals, not sick people. Wouldn't you like to see the city government care for the homeless, mentally ill

I agree with you completely. I DON’T think it’s SPD’s job to deal with the mentally ill and drug-addicted, and the fact that we rely on cops and fire to deal with these populations is a terrible disservice to everyone. Part of the reform I’m calling for is a radical change in the way we approach homelessness and drug addiction, to get cops and medics OUT of the job of caring for these vulnerable populations and back to their actual jobs of busting criminals and putting out fires. That requires that we fund services for those vulnerable people, and to do that we need buy-in from everyone, INCLUDING police and fire unions.

"This thread is jammin' so I don't expect this to not get buried, but it's hit a couple chords with me, too.

My wife and I were both lucky enough to have parents who supported our dreams to the point they would encourage educations in, well, pretty much whatever we wanted. Here we are on the other side with conceptual art degrees (at least mine was media, her's was visual...oy) that would be nearly useless without her comm minor and internship her last year of school. She's debt free, but I fucked around with school and ended up squandering some good scholarships and with about 15k in debt. I know that's not as bad as a lot of folks, but I think it have the same exact debt today as I did when I graduated in 07 with very little in the way of job prospects thanks to the abstract nature of my program.

We started our own business and it was pretty successful. I also bartended 2-10 shifts a week over the past 4 years to supplement the slow seasons. Now she has a job she hates in a field that at least resembles something she's interested in, and I bailed from the bar and am in the middle of a bunch of interviews.

So what? Well, I love Seattle. I moved here  from Phoenix because Phoenix sucks and this place is great. I love living in Seattle proper (even if barely) but I don't feel (and here's the key, ya'll) ENTITLED enough to believe someone owes it to me to live here. As we watch rents and mortgages around us go up up up we realize we're on borrowed time, and the burbs (if we stay in W. Wa) aren't too far off in the future. Does that suck? Sure. But boo-fucking-hoo. No one owes us anything to the point that we DESERVE to live here. If we made more money we absolutely would. But we don't. So we adjust and move on. This whole ""seattle is our town fuck everyone"" mentality that some on this sub (and more IRL) seem to have is shitty. Could you imagine that mentality in other big(ger) cities? Move to Manhattan and tell someone they owe it to you to let you live there working a $15/hr job. I'm sure that'll fly. Wanna live somewhere on that salary? Phoenix is pretty cheap.

For the second year I believe the bonus is payed out pro-rated so you don't have to pay anything back if you work at least 1 year.

"What I find appealing about 100% is :

* no one can complain about fairness or that they were shafted by some arbitrary cutoff line. They won't kick themselves for not buying a house 1 block over. 
* It allows growth to happen where the demand exists (Hello Montlake, Tangletown)
* The more space available for development, the less it will be felt in any given area. For your Ballard Example, one could absolutely make an argument saying the problem is the urban village plan (90% of the growth in 10% of the land) and not with a broader upzone. 
* The city won't spend 5 years trying to draw the line. Citizens won't tell the city they support an upzone, just not in the neighborhood they live in. 

I think its fair to leave a few neighborhoods intact for historical reasons. Like the old mansions south of volunteer park for example. But that should be like 2-5% of the land.

&gt; One reason why they may have made it through is because Germany is a country where more people rent than own. This doesn’t just help foster consensus on renter-friendly legislation.

State of Washington: ""Total impact ranges from a net gain of $31,925,500 to a net cost of $57,324,500.""

City of Tacoma: ""Total impact ranges from a net gain of $301,100 to a net cost of $2,320,900.""

This is the kernel of consistency in all of the responses to this post that hasn't been mentioned. In enterprises as big as Microsoft, Google, Amazon, etc., there can be massive differences in work/life balance depending on the team you're working with. I'd attribute a lot of the complaints here to not communicating expectations about the role during the interview process.

As one example, Amazon has a company culture that places heavy emphasis on individuals owning their projects, from development to release. That means testing them, providing break/fix support (in the form of an on-call rotation), and maybe other stuff that's not ""development"". I've heard lots of phone screens, and very few people ask about work/life balance, even from a personal perspective. (""What's *your* work/life balance like?"" will sometimes get a more accurate answer than ""What's the work/life balance like at *COMPANY*?)

"Having worked at both Microsoft and Amazon, for seven and four years respectively, I can say that the work/life balance at both is *highly* variable depending on which team you land.

"I was at Amazon for ~8.5 years - 2004-2013 - and I had a wonderful experience there.  I learned a ton, got to work with really great people, built products and services that I'm very proud of, and I had a lot of fun.  I found Amazon's work/life balance to be far more manageable after having been at a startup for the 5 years prior to Amazon.  In fact, after 5 years at a startup Amazon was a nice breather.  But that is all a matter of perspective.  

Working at Amazon isn't for everyone.  But no company is.  

In terms of the OP's comments here are my thoughts. 

&gt; You are going to vest around 20% of that in your first two years there.

Accurate.  The terms for the vesting cycle are not near the bar in terms of the industry standard.  I never liked this approach.

&gt; entire system is designed to bring you in, burn you out, and send you on your way with as little equity lost as possible

This is not the intent.  Amazon benefits from engineers the most after they have had a few years of experience working at Amazon.  Once they understand all the tools, technologies, how to work at scale, how to get real substantive work done and how to make true improvements, that is when Amazon benefits the most from those engineers.  Withholding stock is, I think, supposed to incentivize engineers to stay through their first four years and dissuade them from leaving after 2 years.  

Yes, some managers can, and will, work new hires as much as possible.  Stay away from those teams and managers if this isn't what you are looking for and the pros outweigh the cons!  

&gt; Two years is also the amount of time you have to get promoted

You don't have two years to get promoted however most engineers get promoted within that time period.   SDE1 is not an acceptable perma-level so you *do* have to show progress at some point beyond SDE1.  If you haven't gotten promoted and you pass your 4th year then things will likely go poorly.  Note though that this same thing is true at other big tech companies such as Google and Facebook.  

&gt; Leave at 5 or 6PM and go enjoy the city while you are here. 

Definitely!  No matter what company you work for you should do the things that will make you happy.  If that means working all night on a gnarly problem then go for it.   If it means going out on a bender then have at it.  Or perhaps you want to grab Witcher 3 and play it for 12 hours straight (highly recommended).  Whatever you like!

"I love museums, and I've done a lot of them in Seattle.  Here's the ones I like in order of most to least, and I'll tell you why:

*1. Seattle Art Museum (SAM)*

Our biggest and best museum, the SAM is a world-class art museum.  With an extensive and varied permanent collection, as well as interesting rotating exhibits, the SAM is both fun and personally enriching.  And, it's big enough to keep you busy all day.

*2. Seattle Asian Art Museum*

Although not as big as the SAM, the SAAM is still fairly large, and it's something a little more uniquely Seattle.  With large (and very cool) rotating exhibits and a permanent collection of Asian cultural and religious artifacts, it's definitely worth your time.  It's also right near the Volunteer Park Conservatory, so you can hit both in the same trip.

*3. Museum of History and Industry*

Although it has a weird title, this is basically the Seattle History Museum.  MOHAI is actually a pretty fun stop, where a highly-stylized and interactive experience takes you from Seattle's early days as a trading post and a logging town all the way up to its modern history as a tech giant.  Also, it's right next door to the free Center for Wooden Boats, so you can do both in one stop.

*4. Frye Art Museum*

Up on First Hill, the Frye is relatively small.  However, they primarily deal in rotating exhibits, so they always have something new and interesting on display, and they have a small but lively permanent collection of paintings.  Furthermore, they are always free, and they have free parking, which is a huge bonus.

*5. Henry Art Gallery*

Also not a huge museum, but the Henry specialized in very edgy, contemporary art.  If you want to see some stuff that will get you scratching your head, this is the place for it.

*6. Museum of Flight*

This one might skew a little young, but it's still very neat.  Lots of historical planes, space shuttles, and you can even walk through the original Air Force One!

*7. Olympic Sculpture Park*

Always free (although not the parking), this is a decent stop.  About 20 or so large outdoor modern/post-modern sculptures in a park with a great view of the sound and the Olympic Mountains.  It's not a hugely-long stop, and some of the sculptures are cooler than others, but it's free and you'll get some sunshine.

*8. Experience Music Project/Sci-Fi Museum*

Hugely expensive and largely underwhelming, the EMP/SFM is a lot more style than substance.  Despite all the fancy architecture, the crazy interior styling, and the massive hype, these are mostly pretty tame museums full of artifacts.  At the EMP, you get to see old instruments, including all of Jimi Hendrix's broken guitars.  There's a section where you get to play with some instruments, which I guess is fascinating if you've never picked up an instrument in your life.  The SFM is a dark room full of old sci-fi props and costumes.  It's sort of fun, but it's also a little bit of a let down.

*9. Burke Museum*

This is probably the only one I recommend you *don't* go to.  Way overpriced at $10 a ticket, this is a museum that's not really meant for anyone.  It's small, and it's a combination of simplistic natural history exhibits geared towards young children and a dry collection of random Native American artifacts.  If you desperately want to drop some cash so you can learn what a volcano is and then look at 20 woven baskets, this is the place for you.",false,false,t1_csp19ou,theultrayik,Magnolia,0,1435779091,t5_2qhad,t3_3bs1hh,t3_3bs1hh,11,1437499582,0,1,csp19ou,Seattle,11,,flair

"Anecdotally - I've met a number of people who *aspire* to a degree from Bastyr.  For years, they don't make any move to go (or finish), but frequently say that they want to.  And to a person, they are awful.  Horrible ignorance.  Every awful stereotype.
And then, I've met people who have *graduated* from Bastyr.  People who spent four years or more in serious study, and who are allowed to prescribe real drugs.  And THEY have been reasonable, thoughtful, helpful, deliberate, intentional, and effective people.

A few years back, I would gasp and sit down trying to carry a laundry basket up a flight of stairs. I couldn't do it. My regular docs had no answers (must be seeking attention or premenstrual or something, stop lying) and my asthma doc insisted the only cure was a permanent course of prednisone.  F that. I finally went to a naturopath - I had nothing left to lose.

He suggested HEPA filters in my bedroom, and did standard lab work. I was severely anemic and had nearly no vitamin D. Those things were fixed in about two weeks, and then I was FINE.

He'll prescribe antibiotics for bacterial infections, says he encourages antidepressants for people he thinks are depressed and need 'em, and refers you to a medical specialist where appropriate.  But he won't spend ten minutes looking at young-woman and insist that she can't breathe because she wants attention or because she's depressed or because she's lying or because it's out of control asthma despite no other symptoms of otherwise-controlled asthma.  He'll problem-solve for the human. I went through SO many doctors that would not even try, who wouldn't even do lab work. Fuck. that.

Fuck you. You can't put in the hustle when the entire generation ahead of us pulled the latter out from our grasp.

You pushed all the affordable housing to the burbs, so now we have to use cars or buses to get to our work, but you won't pay the taxes to support them, or the increase the wage to let us afford to buy cars. You've done everything in your power to insure that you stay in your comfortable little world, while continually fucking over everyone else behind you in regards to the environment, the economy, and the country. So no, fuck you and your ""pull yourselves up by the bootstraps"" self. You had every benefit that we haven't, and want to insist it's just as easy? No thanks bro.

"&gt;What is your take on the potential for NBA/NHL in Seattle?

A long time ago I realized that sports in Seattle were a part of the entertainment world, and that people love sports and use sports the same way they do music and art: as comfort and solace, as emotional outlet and repository of passionate love. I support the MOU that the city has with Chris Hansen’s group, and I hope as much as anyone else to see the Sonics back in Seattle, just because I understand how much it means to people. That said, a request for significant public financing would change the deal we signed -- which I think was a very good deal for Seattle -- and Seattle should get a chance to debate any changes. I’m not a sports maniac myself, and I understand the reluctance that non-sports-fans have to these big arena projects, but I remind myself that this particular arena will also be a great place for big rock concerts and Death Cab for Cutie is starting to outgrow the Key Arena!

&gt;What is your response to the sceptics and critics of your light rail proposal? Follow on: Are funiculars a real possibility for this city?

There are a lot of transit experts in this town--and a lot of them are smarter than I am and their many criticisms all have merit--but the fact is that we need a comprehensive transportation plan that includes rail and no one else is proposing one. Most critics object to our rosy estimates of how much it will cost to build rail, and I admit we chose optimistic numbers, but even if we only managed to build HALF the rail we proposed it would still be an incredible system of local transit that would revolutionize the city. As for funiculars and gondolas, they are actually a perfectly valid and forward-thinking method of moving people around a hilly city and I firmly believe that they have a place in our transportation infrastructure.

"This is the worst of all possible worst-case scenarios, and not really very likely. The port would be heavily damaged by a quake, but could very quickly be rebuilt since the tsunami would have relatively little impact on the Elliot Bay area, the port's largest vulnerability is that the shore infrastructure sits on a liquefaction zone, but given that any resultant tsunami would completely devastate the Port of Tacoma it would a top priority to get it operational - there is just no other choice. I would imagine you'd be looking at it being operational at some capacity in days, and becoming the center of local relief efforts. As for the tech companies. They stay, of course they stay, there is no other choice. They can redistribute operations to other locals in the short term as needed, but the sheer investment in the area companies like Microsoft have make it almost impossible to leave. Plus Redmond is positioned well to survive a quake and once the infrastructure begins to rebuild operations can resume. Seattle based companies are going to be hit much harder. Amazon might leave, it's a possibility, although most of their buildings are constructed to the right code so other than infrastructure issues they might not suffer as hard as others. Companies are insured against these things so they can weather such storms, abandoning the PNW just isn't an option, especially in the I-5 corridor.

But the biggest reason why I think this is way too pessimistic is the Navy.

First- [Proof!]  (http://imgur.com/wwNXxxx)

Second - It was absolutely my pleasure to assist Saturday! Backstory:

I was in the area dropping off a friend after we played 2 games in the brutal heat for a corporate charity soccer tournament; Apologies for the mess in my car. We saw you as I turned onto her street and I chuckled (one look at the bus and you'd laugh too).  I dropped my friend off and as it happened, I needed to come back the way I came and as I approached the bus again, I came to the conclusion that this was not something any couple should couple should have to endure. The rest is just an awesome wedding story you can tell your friends and family about later!

I did this not for recognition, but because people needed help on a very special day that shouldn't be marred by bad luck (and newbie bus drivers who should know better than to take anything other than QA Ave up the hill). Plus, sometimes, something compels you to do something great for a complete stranger.  When you get back from your honeymoon message me!  I'd be more than happy to meet up with you at a local bar and share a beer with you!

/u/poppycorn, I was about to tell you that we're not on The Knot, but turns out my fiance first registered there before forgetting and creating a website somewhere else! The Knot requires you to input at least two characters for the last name, so I was about to get really creeped out as to how you could have possibly found our registry. Took me a second to realize you can get by the two character last name requirements on The Knot by typing **. I applaud your sleuthing skills!

"Honestly, almost every time I've really felt unsafe, I can trace it back to a mistake on my part.  Not breaking a law, not doing something that is generally thought of as risky - but instead doing something that society in general seems to think is the right thing!  - but a mistake, regardless.

Nearly every case has been a situation where I let my innate desire to be ""friendly"" drive me too far to the right, allowing for crazy-unsafe passes.  The blame is 100% on the human waste piles that decided passing a bike at speed with 3"" space was a reasonable idea - but these cases could have been prevented if I had not allowed misguided politeness to negatively impact my safety.

If the lane is not wide enough for a bike, riding a safe distance from all car doors, 3 feet of separation, and a car to ALL exist INSIDE the lane, take the lane.  Period.  And that's completely consistent with the law - You're required to be as far to the right as safe, but one of the limitations explicitly called out in that law is a lane of insufficient width.

Not taking the lane, you will get close passes.  Take the lane, and you might VERY infrequently get some jerkface doing it to make a point, but those are extremely rare.  For some reason, though, being far right seems to make some small-but-significant subset of drivers think passing a cyclist with inches space, sandwiching them between parked cars that could open doors with no warning, and leaving ZERO space for dodging potholes/obstructions/etc, ensuring that a slight bump has the potential to end your life - oh, yeah, that's a great idea!  It's bizarre to me, but it seems like there's some psychological oddity makes some drivers willing to un-repentantly dismiss the value of your existence if it saves them crossing the yellow line to make a pass like they do for everyone else on the road.

The sad thing here is, being to the right is *perceived* as nice, but really it isn't.  If you're all the way to the right and someone passes you safely, they still have to move into the other lane.  Meaning they still have to wait for traffic to clear and allow time to get around --- EXACTLY as they would if you were assertively taking the lane.  The only people you're actually making things easier for are those who are willing to put your life at risk. 

Anyway, I'm always working to improve on my own behavior, but the one critical thing to remember is NEVER compromise your safety for ""politeness"" - especially when doing so only helps those putting you at risk in the first place.  

Now, having said that, do what you can to mitigate delays and impacts.  Choose routes that allow you to ride safely but allow traffic to flow around you.  Downtown and in most of central Seattle this is usually pretty easy, since just about everything is multi-lane.  But the nature of our still-not-quite-really-connected network of bike infrastructure is that sometimes to get from point A to B you will need to be on a 2-lane (one in each direction), often with parking on either side.  This is when the temptation is the worst - and the danger created by giving in is the greatest.  The rare annoyed motorist that rages out because he is delayed 30 seconds waiting for a pass opportunity is still MUCH better for your health than the relatively common motorist that risks your life in a socially-acceptable unsafe pass.  Almost 40% of cyclist fatalities are hit-from-behind while attempting to overtake.  The number intentionally hit by road-ragers, despite all the hateful rhetoric you see on the internet, is actually extremely small.

"&gt; In my opinion the ACA is an unconstitutional tax.

Ah, now we're getting somewhere.  The Court disagreed, on the basis that the Congress has the power to tax and that power is relatively unlimited, insofar as whether or not a court can find it unconstitutional.  What do you think is unconstitutional about it?  Quoth the opinion (slip opinion, syllabus page 4):

&gt; The payment is not so high that there is really no choice but to buy health insurance...  None of this is to say that payment is not intended to induce the purchase of health insurance.  But the mandate need not be read to declare that failing to do so is unlawful.

Further, Chief Justice Roberts wrote that the court has (slip opinion, C.J. Roberts for the majority, page 44):

&gt; ...a duty to construe a statute to save it, if fairly possible, [so section] 5000A can be interpreted as a tax.

That's the opposite of judicial activism.  Congress passed a law, the President signed it, and the Court's role is to determine if it fits within our Constitutional framework.  Whether people *like* the law or thought it a good fit is not relevant.

In regards to your assertion here:

&gt; Instead of doing something to address actual healthcare cost we just added more levels of expensive bureaucracy. 

That's not a failing of the Court, that's a failing--in your eyes--of our political process.

"WSDOT [would appear to disagree](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hos_uIKwC-c). Most of the seawall area and the area comprised of SoDo and Harbor Island are sitting on fill, which will *liquefy* during earthquakes. The only relatively ""safe"" structure down there is the CLink because they anchored it so deep. Additionally, huge chunks of downtown sit on the rubble of pre-fire Seattle. *On top of all of that*, Seattle sits largely on 1,000 feet of glacial till before there's bedrock, making shaking worse here than you would generally find in areas such as SF or LA. **If that wasn't bad enough**, Seattle sits *directly over* a fault, whereas the major epicenter for other faultlines is typically 50-60 miles outside the city. The 1906 SF quake was actually centers an hour's drive north, outside Santa Rosa. Historically, the Seattle area has sustained larger quakes than SF. Usually, there is a large ~9.5M earthquake in Seattle, followed by a ~9.2 earthquake in SF a few days to years later. The 1906 quake is a rare exception, and this exception has given us a sense of relative complacency in terms of earthquake standards in our building codes. Yes, we got a wakeup with Nisqually, but I don't think most people realize that we should expect the worst earthquakes in the world here.

And to really drive the point home, at one point centuries ago, there was a super shallow earthquake **in Elliott Bay itself** where the south side of the plate lifted 21 feet in 5 seconds: all of the land south of the fault running between Alki and Restoration point. Alki and Restoration Point exist as they do now solely because of this quake. This uplift caused a localized tsunami in Puget Sound that sent waves up into a relatively uninhabited Seattle and up the Sound all the way to Everett.

Ah ha! My time to shine!

So, in Woodinville if you go to the Hollywood Schoolhouse area, you'll mainly get the eastern WA wineries that do production over there. Where you'll want to go is the Warehouse Districts. Most of the wineries in the Warehouse District are producing the wines in the warehouse, right there. Some of my favorites:

North (Main) Warehouse district:

* Patterson Cellars
* Davenport Cellars
* Baer Winery
* Flying Dreams
* Barrage Cellars
* Armstrong Family Winery

Then there's the southern warehouse district, which is just across North Woodinville Way on 142nd Ave NE. Eventually it'll be named ""Artisan Hill"" but I don't think they're there yet. Anywho, over there you'll find some gems like:

* Convergence Zone Cellars
* Two Vintners
* Stevens Winery
* Pomum Cellars
* Pacific Distillery (Go get some Gin and Absinthe... seriously good stuff)

If you're in Seattle, go down to the Seattle Urban Wineries, where many of them produce onsite or at least close by. Some of my favorites from this area (although I've never visited their tasting rooms, I've had their wines and loved them):

* Bartholomew Winery
* Cloudlift Cellars
* Nota Bene Cellars

Many of the above wineries will often have the winemakers there onsite, pouring the wines for you. Just be friendly, and tell them you're from out of town and would love to see where the wine is made, and if they're available, they may even give you a tour of the back and you'll be able to see where the wines are made. Most people are SUPER friendly there, so just be your happy normal self and you'll be treated right. 

Make a plan for Woodinville, pick at most 5 wineries to hit in a three hour period and you may even get to them all. Also, check the hours of the wineries in the Warehouse Districts because many of them are only open on Saturdays.

"So this Saturday we sent a crab pot down with a GoPro attached to it. We'd been having spotty luck, wanted to see what was going on down there... Left if down for an hour and a half and went jigging.  (Jiggety jiggety...) Turns out there's a lot more flatfish hanging out down there than I'd though, though this does explain why it's really easy to catch them around there... 

We'd already caught three limits that day so all the crabs in the video were released unharmed.  (Their friends and relatives were delicious, however.)

Pedantic details:
- Location: Off the east of Bainbridge Island

- Time: about 3:00-4:30

- Depth ~80 feet

- Speed: Video sped up 10x

- Bait: chicken drumsticks and a turkey drumstick. Note: we had to bend the bait lid to get that turkey in there, and the next pull after this a line got snagged on it and the crabs were able to pull it open and run off with the bait. So no more of that nonsense.

- Species: Red Rock and Dungeness crab. Fish include various sorts of tasty flatfish like Sand Soles. There's like two dozen species in the Sound and they're hard to identify. Also some cute little Surf Perch or something.

&gt;While we're on brunch, how about hollandaise sauce? Not for me. Bacteria love hollandaise. And hollandaise, that delicate emulsion of egg yolks and clarified butter, must be held at a temperature not too hot nor too cold, lest it break when spooned over your poached eggs. Unfortunately, this lukewarm holding temperature is also the favorite environment for bacteria to copulate and reproduce in. Nobody I know has ever made hollandaise to order. Most likely, the stuff on your eggs was made hours ago and held on station. Equally disturbing is the likelihood that the butter used in the hollandaise is melted table butter, heated, clarified, and strained to get out all the bread crumbs and cigarette butts. Butter is expensive, you know. Hollandaise is a veritable petri dish of biohazards. And how long has that Canadian bacon been aging in the walk-in anyway? Remember, brunch is served only once a week -- on the weekends. Buzzword here, ""Brunch Menu."" Translation? ""Old, nasty odds and ends, and twelve dollars for two eggs with a free bloody Mary!""

Good overall. Hours were actually fine, pay was good, good teammates, interesting work. Company was too frugal though, tried to stiff me on raises as much as possible, and some of the internal tooling could use a lot of work.

Better in a lot of ways. Google has much better internal tooling, better equipment, free food and gym, better 401k, better pay...pretty much everything is better. Only thing I miss is that Googlers seem to be more positive than Amazonians, and I miss the snark.

"&gt; People who are disabled/low-income/welfare/etc. have the ability to move to cheaper areas.

No, this isn't true.

People who are disabled or on fixed incomes are the least mobile people of any given city. They face huge financial challenges coming up with moving costs of a new lease, not to mention the costs or issues of moving house.

These people don't have unused savings sitting around. SSI/SSDI income is about 700-800 a month for most recipients, which usually disqualifies them for food stamps. So all housing, food, transportation, hygiene and personal upkeep comes out of that tiny budget.

Savings? What savings? SSI/SSDI recipients are usually penniless by the middle of the month, if not the first few days when rent/bills need to get paid.

There's also the issues of trying to find section 8, HUD, or housing that accepts housing vouchers. Many of these people have had to wait for *years* to get into housing in the first place.

They don't just get to move somewhere more affordable. It isn't a valid choice for most of this segment of the population.

There's also the issue of access to health care services, which are - surprise! - mainly clustered around downtown. So someone with MS or a paraplegic moves to Kent. They now face huge transportation issues trying to make it to medical appointments, which is a huge hardship if they're stuck in a wheel chair, carless and reliant on multiple-hour, multiple-transfer bus rides to their appointments.

And if they miss those appointments? They could lose their benefits entirely.

&gt; They are people who can't or won't accept government help and get proper placement in subsidized housing.

This is a huge myth. Yes, untreated mental illness is a huge issue, as is untreated drug abuse - these two issues are really the same issue - but the notion that most homeless people are criminals isn't true in my experience.

Most felonious criminals have the street smarts to make money, be it through theft, drug dealing or other crime.

And it's a total myth government help and subsidized housing is readily and easily available. Last time I checked the wait time for Seattle Housing Authority is 8+ years. It's often even longer for HUD/Section 8.

I struggled with trying to find stable housing for multiple years. The wait times and paperwork are insane. I'm extremely high functioning for someone who was struggling with a disability, and I fell in and out of the program due to long wait times and missing paperwork or appointments (directly related to said disability) and ultimately I ""failed out"" of the system.

I even had a DESC advocate. Who could give me maybe thirty minutes of their time *per month* to try and engage the social safety net.

There aren't really other advocates out there helping people navigate the intensely bureaucratic public health care system.

There is no map or guideline. There's no one in the DSHS offices ""Ok, so you need help. Here's some free housing, a doctor's appointment in a week or two like you had real insurance, and here's how the program works to de-fuck your situation.""

There's practically no help available unless you have the ability and intelligence to fight for it.

So all of those untreated, severely mentally ill people on the street? It's not that they're refusing government assistance. It's more likely that they already tried it and were failed by the system you're talking about.

Because that system doesn't really exist. It's been gutted and torn to pieces.

I seriously hope you never have to discover this first hand like I did, because it's fucking terrifying. Everyone out there who has jobs and the ability to achieve assumes that this safety net still exists.

"Texas cities are fractionally as dense as Seattle, they take up inordinate amounts of land which we do not have. Austin (270 sqmi) for comparison is about 1.5 times as populous as Seattle (82 sqmi) and almost 4 times as big! (3300/sqmi versus 8000/sqmi)

Houston and Dallas are the same. Houston is 600 square miles! Seattle/s urban area is only 1200 IIRC.  - Seattle's urban area is as dense as houston City, and houston city is only half of the Houston area. 

Texas cities are cheap because they don't care about taking more and more land for houses. Not because they're some low-rise dense places.  They are in fact Seattle amplified, because they do not have the core densities Seattle does for as much area, and they also have skyscrapers for offices, so their traffic problems are worse despite 24 fucking lane freeways into and out of some of their cities! 

At least Seattle is catching up on the high-rise housing near the high-rise offices. In fact, I think we have like the 4th or 5th highest core (Downtown resident) population, and are usually the fastest growing. Most cities don't have tons of housing downtown, so we're uniquely positioned to not deal with the problems of high rise offices nearly as much as places like Houston, Dallas, Austin, etc. 


So If we compare Seattle To Houston, yes Houston has cheap housing in the city, but that's because the city limits would extend all the way to Auburn or Sumner!!!

"ELI5:

A car costs everyone else in the city far more than buses or bikes do.

More grown-up version:

A car is the textbook example of a negative external cost. A negative external cost is a cost that is born by people outside of yourself. For example, by choosing to drive instead of busing or biking, you cause extra pollution, cause more wear and tear on the roads, and contribute massively to congestion.

A car takes up roughly the same amount of space on the road as a bus, causes only a little less damage to the road as a bus (actually it causes far more if you think in a per rider metric), pollutes far more on a per-rider basis than a bus, and causes far more congestion problems than a bus. Additionally, a bus is available to anyone willing to pay (public vehicle on a public road while a car is a private vehicle on a public road).

That same arguments hold true for bikes except that bikes essentially don't pollute, don't cause wear-and-tear (when compared to walking), and they relieve congestion.

A car tab is way of making you pay that external cost, and the car tab does not come even close to covering the cost. Based purely on making you pay the external costs, the car tab should cost *thousands* of dollars.

If you don't want to help pay for buses and bike lanes, imagine all of those people using buses and bikes (aka more than half the people who commute) doing it in a car. If you think your commute is bad now, imagine it when everyone is in a car because you didn't want to pay for buses or bikes.",false,false,t1_ct4p23v,Cadoc7,East Queen Anne,0,1436999795,t5_2qhad,t3_3dfnwa,t3_3dfnwa,16,1437884183,0,0,ct4p23v,Seattle,16,,flair

"Working now:  Chef Software, Inc.

Come from:  Before Amazon?  Dot bomb startup in the late 90s

Living Now:  Seattle

Worked At Amazon:  2001-2006

Position:  System Engineer III

Experience:  Technically very good, but culture is the worst possible.  Good place to spend a few years in order to get exposure to the industry, then its time to leave and find someplace better.  I stayed too long.  It was particularly bad as a non-SDE since Amazon has all the problems with ""developer driven meritocracies"" that you read about with a penny pinching HR and corporate culture on top of it.  If you're on one of the higher profile software dev teams life might be different.

New Job:  1000% better culture.  Instead of Bezos' top-down 'meriotocratic' penny-pinching libertarian b.s., latest job culture is based more on trying to do the right thing, be transparent and the No Asshole Rule.

The whole ""ruined the city"" thing is waaaaay after my time.  The jobs pay well and attract tech talent, and other companies can scoop up people who leave, so its great that Amazon is successful.  People that have experienced Amazon and don't like the culture also make excellent employees at firms that don't share Amazon's cultural principles.  If you're a sociopath who wants to climb to the top of the biggest game in town and like having power over people who are less aggressive than you are, then by all means please go work for Amazon, you'll fit right in...

EDIT:  just read the ""advice to interns"" thread and it sounds like not much has changed.  I'd suggest working at Amazon in order to get it on your resume, and don't stay for more than 2 years.  It won't make you rich, nor happy, but it will give you experience and good resume material.  I'd also suggest getting hired on when you're at least intermediate-level in your skillset and have some bargaining leverage.  If you get hired on as an intern or have no bargaining leverage then you can be assured you're getting payed well under market -- in that case you really need to be looking at the job as a resume stuffer and move on and hop jobs as soon as you can find one that'll give you a $20-$30k/yr or more bump in salary (and generally if you want to climb the salary ladder you need to be switching jobs fairly frequently after a year or two -- HR departments are *all* really stupid about raises and retention, so you just need to switch jobs to get raises).",false,false,t1_ct00tyt,scubadger,,0,1436648611,t5_2qhad,t3_3cxmdm,t3_3cxmdm,14,1437778902,0,0,ct00tyt,Seattle,14,,

Following thee Monorail on foot, they make their way to the Pike Place Market, where they form a new mass of tourists, taking pictures of each other taking pictures of each other. Robotic fishmongers play catch with fish that have washed up from Elliot Bay.

To be slightly snarky: I think that's called ""being an adult without rich parents"". I don't know anyone who supports themselves who would say otherwise about their situation.

Less snarkily - I encourage you to take a very nasty look at your job market post-graduation. Don't assume flowers and roses. Go out to network with people making a living in that market and ask them pushy and uncomfortable questions about job turnover rate, what they look for.  You should be aware that in many fields, this is impossible to do realistically without being in a city like Seattle. You're blessed to be in the middle of a boom-town.  If you don't like the answers that the locals are giving about your major's job market, consider switching majors. Definitely get an internship - PAID. If your field has no paid internship, *this is your value on the cash market without a degree (and probably with a fresh degree too)... not worth giving money to*. Think about these things very hard before graduating. It gets harder afterwards. 

I share your frustration about ""Like every other millenial in America, I was told that if I work hard and go to college then I'll be able to make a decent living"". It's just not true.  I encourage a very harsh look at your ROI on college degrees and career prospects: only people quite lucky and/or wealthy get to go to university to do pure intellectual stimulation without paying very hard for it later in life.

- It's really stupidly fast. The problem is there are very few servers that can handle it. The only time I really max out my download speed is downloading from Valve, Microsoft, or Google. My fastest download was about 85mbp/s.

- Netflix just loads instantly.

- Gaming ping times are extremely low

Bad:

- It took them awhile to get the billing working. I was being overcharged for months for some reason. They DID fix this pretty quickly once I pointed it out to them. I'm paying around $110/mo for the 1gb up/down.

- The stock modem they give you is horrible. Just horrible. If you actually tried using it for WIFI you'd top out at 20mbps.

- A good modem is expensive. I finally buckled down and bought an AC1900 and I'm finally seeing good WIFI speeds - around 800mbps in the same room, 500mbps upstairs.

Regardless, as a bicyclist and motorcyclist, the duck boats have always seemed like a major road hazard to me.

They have poor visibility; if I can't see the driver, he probably can't see me.

"&gt;100 hours a week? So you're talking about those 14 hour days? Where you start at 8am and work until 10pm.. 7 days a week? Or perhaps a 5 day week, 8am-4am the next day.. every day? I just don't buy it.

Happens (or happened) quite a bit -I did it myself for about half a year before I changed career tracks. Start at 10 or 11, work until 2 or 3. Seven days a week, including holidays. Though I personally made more than enough in salary, stock awards, and bonuses for it to be worth it, that wasn't true for everybody else. It's less common in the corporate world, more common in the video game industry.

&gt;That's 5200 hours, or $37,700 at minimum wage.

Work it out at 80-100 hours a week -account for missing ""time and a half"" and ""double time"" at the appropriate intervals. Minimum wage in states with most software engineering jobs is also typically over $9/hour.

&gt;If you're a software engineer, and you're making less than $37,700, I can't believe you're in the US. Most companies hire software engineers out of college for at least double that (if not triple).

Your estimate is severely lowball -but yeah most companies hire SEs at around $100k/year. The game industry will frequently hire new grads for less than that, many large tech companies hire for more.

&gt;The collusion stuff is silly.

Not sure what you mean by silly. Laws were amended so that software engineers specifically are exempt from overtime. That's not an exaggeration. And then companies did what they do best -toe the line on labor law to maximize profit.

I was a brick mason for 5 years before going to college, becoming an engineer, rising through the ranks of tech etc... my quality of life is not fundamentally different now than it was then, though on paper I make several times what I earned before. I live in a much, much more expensive city, I guess, is the major difference. I certainly have less free time than I did when I could leave work at work.

"Source:  Live in Seattle, had a job which involved commuting to Vancouver by car.  In the course of 2 years I crossed the border approximately 100 times.

First thing to know.  Going to Vancouver you have 3 1/2 border crossings to take advantage of.  Peace Arch is the path of least resistance and most traffic.  The ""truck crossing"" (exit 275) can be used by anyone, not just trucks.  There is a 3rd crossing at Lynden which can be reached by taking 539 out of Bellingham.  Aldergrove/Lynden will add about 30 minutes to your trip because it's pretty far East and involves two-lane highways.  Check the border crossing times and decide if it's worth it.  The half is a fourth crossing at Sumas/Abbotsford.  This will add another 20+ minutes to your drive.

First and a half.  If you're bored or indecisive about which border crossing to use going back, take 0 Avenue East from the truck crossing to Aldergrove.  This is a road which literally runs on the border.  Be amused about driving in Canada while looking at driveways which are in Washington State.

Second:  Tune your radio to AM 730 as you approach Bellingham.  This station is all traffic, all the time.  They broadcast border crossing times both ways every 10 minutes.

Third:  If traffic is good (and that's a BIG if) you should allocate 2 hours from Downtown Seattle to the border and another hour from the border to downtown Vancouver.  Traffic can add another hour to the travel time from Seattle to the border.  Expect traffic.

Third:  The border just sucks on holiday weekends.  It sucks sucks sucks.  If your constitution allows for it, travel in the middle of the night.  You may still be waiting for quite some time.

Fourth:  Hitting duty free will reduce your crossing time quite a bit.

Fifth:  NB:  THIS IS KINDA A DICK MOVE.  YOUR ETHICS MAY ALLOW IT.  OR NOT.

Take Exit 275 to the truck crossing.  Take a right on D street.  Take a left on 14th St.  Take a left on B street.
You will now be in the duty free parking lot approximately 100 feet from the border.  They have to let you in to traffic no matter how badly backed up the border is.  If you buy something from duty free, I'd say you're in the clear.  If you don't, well, you're kind of a dick.

"Seattle is, like many dense liberal cities, becoming much more of a superstar city, as Edward Glaeser defines it in [The Triumph of the City](http://www.amazon.com/Triumph-City-Greatest-Invention-Healthier/dp/0143120549). That means that it has a densely urbanized core, strong education facilities, and intense research / development / intellectual industries. Innovation, in the sense Peter Thiel describes in [Zero to One](http://jakeseliger.com/2014/09/24/zero-to-one-peter-thiel-and-blake-masters/), plus the ability to sell to global markets leads to extremely high earning potential for some people. 

For reasons still somewhat opaque to me and rooted in psychology, politics, and law, (but that are somewhat discussed by Glaeser and by Tyler Cowen in [Average is Over](http://jakeseliger.com/2013/09/13/thoughts-on-tyler-cowens-average-is-over/)), liberal and superficially progressive cities like Seattle also tend to generate intense land-use controls and opposition to development. This tends to strangle housing supply. The combination of high incomes generated by innovation and selling to global markets, along with limited housing supply, tends to price non-superstars out of the market. Various subsidy schemes generate much more noise than practical assistance for people, and markets are at best exceedingly hard to alter through government fiat. Sun Belt cities are growing so fast and so consistently [because of real affordable housing](http://www.nber.org/papers/w13071). People move to them because housing is cheap. Issues with superstar cities and housing affordability are well-known in the research community but those issues haven't translated much into voters voting for greater housing supply. 

Ignore the many bogeymen being discussed in this thread and focus on market fundamentals. Seattle is increasingly great for economic superstars. Most of them probably aren't wasting time posting to or reading Reddit. If you are not a superstar Seattle, like L.A., Boston, New York, and many other cities is going to be very difficult to build a future in. Many voters don't understand basic economics (as this sub-reddit demonstrates routinely), and existing property owners prefer to exclude rivalrous uses. 

See also [this discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/3cgu1i/more_seattlearea_buyers_compete_for_fewer_houses/) and [my discussion of Jane Jacobs and urban land politics](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/2ej9uc/this_current_rseattle_discussion_about_nicest/ck029f8). Ignore any comments that lack citations to actual research. 

**EDIT**: Note too that, as Matt Yglesias points out in [The Rent Is Too Damn High: What To Do About It, And Why It Matters More Than You Think](http://www.amazon.com/Rent-Too-Damn-High-Matters-ebook/dp/B0078XGJXO), nominally free-market conservatives also tend to oppose development and support extensive land-use controls. But urban cities like Seattle [almost always tilt leftward relative to suburbs and rural areas](http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2012/10/rodden_on_the_g.html). Why this happens isn't well understood. 

Still, it's telling that Seattlites generate a lot of rhetoric around affordable housing and being progressive while simultaneously attacking policies that would actually provide affordable housing and be actually progressive. Some of you may have heard the hot air around Piketty.

See the happy homosexuals frolicking in their native habitat!  Oooh, aren't they exotic?""  We kept threatening to take one of their tours, just to find out.

I also lived a block from the beach for a while in southern California.  Almost all the places around us were summer rentals, crammed with tourists who were paying the same rent we paid for a month just to stay there for one week.  Parking was a pain, it was noisy and crowded...but I never let myself forget that other people were saving up all their money and their vacation time and cramming ten or fifteen people into a tiny cottage, just to hang out here for a week...and I got to live here, year-round.",false,false,t1_ctik3jv,casagordita,SeaTac,0,1438051744,t5_2qhad,t3_3eu11y,t3_3eu11y,28,1440126910,0,0,ctik3jv,Seattle,28,,flair

"You're ignoring a lot of the complexities of economics in order to paint an apocalyptic picture.

First, Seattle is a very important city in the national and global economy. It's one of the three major tech hotbeds in the US. There would be a massive federal and international recovery effort to get the region back on its feet. The companies won't leave, primarily because at first they won't be able to. Infrastructure will be severely damaged and mostly unusable, meaning the volume of resources they'd need to transport simply couldn't get where they would need to go. Also, for a company to flee instead of stick around and help would taint that company's reputation permanently. People would see it as selfish and inhumane, and the short-term loss of business would be disastrous. It would be in their best interests to help the city recover, and by the time things got back to functional, it would no longer make any sense to leave. The complexity and expense, especially for those that are deeply embedded in this region, like Microsoft, would be greater than if they just worked to get back up and running where they are. And shareholders aren't going to look at a company in a city that's just gone through an enormous earthquake and say ""well you're not working to capacity, we're bailing"". Companies have insurance for this sort of thing.

On top of all that, a major quake will cause a tsunami that will cause extensive damage along coastal Japan, and possibly some of Tokyo. A Cascadia quake will affect the entire world.

As an aside, it isn't unreasonable to think that a Cascadia quake could trigger a large San Andreas quake, or vice-versa. What if that happens? Will we just abandon the west coast? No. That's not how people respond to this sort of thing. I would stay. I'd want to see my city rebuild.

What's causing the issues is the inability of drivers to query for and pay a toll easily. The way it is now, you cannot pay a toll without the mailed notice. So if you use the bridge today, instead of paying it off when you come back home you have to remember to check your mail until you receive a notice and then promptly pay it off before the deadline expires. If you are one of those people who doesn't use mail for anything important or if you moved recently then you are setting yourself up for trouble.

Many women were going to be over 150 miles from the nearest abortion clinic, which handily screws over anyone poor -- the trip would be costly and time-consuming.

I seem to recall that similar ""for your own safety"" BS laws have been passed in other Southern states in recent years, causing clinics to close and making abortion access at an all-time low.  Maybe the protest was to raise awareness of the plight of women with increasingly restricted access in other states, to encourage a push on the federal level against this sort of BS state-level legislation?",false,false,t1_csplogc,Wingman4l7,Wallingford,0,1435816963,t5_2qhad,t3_3bto99,t1_cspj0ju,13,1437516166,0,0,csplogc,Seattle,13,,flair

"There’s a common misconception that politics is something that we should leave to the experts. That’s it’s too complicated for regular citizens to really grasp. It sounds reasonable, but it’s a really anti-democratic mentality. When Tim Burgess first ran for office he was the owner of a public relations company, and Jean Godden was a gossip columnist. Now they are the incumbents and can claim to be experts in public policy. We should never allow that attitude--that elected government should be the exclusive province of experts--to take root in our minds. Elected government should always be open to the broadest group of citizens possible.

Am I an idealist? Hell yes I am! My campaign is elevating the discussion on city-wide issues I don’t hear discussed anywhere-- transportation plans that would give us control of the system, worrisome trends downtown as we return to mass arrests and civility laws in public parks, and constructing municipal internet to be the first major city to strive for data equity. Idealism isn’t always impractical. We should strive to keep our ideals in view, and never succumb to cynicism and realpolitik just because we feel hopeless. 

I wasn’t endorsed by the Seattle Times OR the Stranger. I don’t have the support of the Chamber of Commerce OR the Sawant Army.

"This has turned into a bit of a joke thread but I grew up in an LA suburb and our house was destroyed (condemned, needed to be demolished) by the 1987 Whittier Narrows quake and our new house needed extensive repairs after the Northridge quake about 6 years later.

Northridge was a stronger and longer quake, but for whatever reason (location, construction, age of house) the whittier one did far more damage to our house. The slab foundation of our house cracked in half (even ripped the carpet in the hallway) and when it was over, half of the house was about 4-5"" higher than the other half of the house, but perfectly solid because the ground had moved up with it.

I have a vivid memory of looking UP (head tilted) at my crying dad holding my baby sister at the end of the hallway and then looking DOWN (again, head tilted) at them a few seconds later, and then the ground I was on (it was kind-of a rolling sensation quake) just ""fell"" suddenly and it knocked me and my mom and brothers off our feet and then it stopped. It was insanely loud and then eerily quiet instantly. I don't remember a lot of the aftermath other than living with my grandparents for a few weeks while we found somewhere else to live and I know I was upset that my fish died when they splashed out of their bowl (I stepped on one and it slid between my toes and got stuck - I still remember that icky feeling) but I don't remember much else.

I remember the Northridge quake and the aftermath vividly though. When the northridge quake (6.7) happened my friends and I went to the red cross station set up at our high school to volunteer.  I'm not an expert but I have a little insight to big quakes if anyone cares...

1) Get away from glass when the shaking starts - I don't have any pictures and my parents haven't digitized the ones I know they have, but a shard of glass from a large framed picture I had hanging over my bed pierced all the way through my mattress and into the ""trampoline material"" it rested on (it was a trundle-bed type thingy with trampoline material and small springs all around type bed frame). It fell right where my chest would have been if I didn't instantly wake up, jump out of bed, and run for the doorway when the shaking started, so glass is a lot more dangerous than you realize- it can kill, not just cut. Also, obviously, get away from heavy solid shit that can fall on you too.

2) Even if you think ""prepping"" is silly, you should have several gallons of clean drinking water stored somewhere in your house and car for emergencies. (water gets contaminated all the time and the stores run out before most people that need water can get there to buy any, but water is even MORE important in emergencies like earthquakes when even contaminated water might not run through your pipes)The red cross assigned all the well-meaning teenagers (me included) that came to volunteer the task of going back to our neighborhoods and telling everyone to fill up their bathtubs and boil any water they drink or cook with because of broken water mains. Our neighborhood ended up not having any trouble, but I think my grandparents (in Reseda, right next door to Northridge) went a couple weeks without clean running water due to all the broken water lines. 

3) Don't let your cupboards run bare. Grocery stores will close, and the ones that open can only let a few people in at a time, and only into a limited section of the store. You know how everything falls off of your shelves in a quake? Yeah, that happens at the stores too... It's a huge mess and they can't let terrified people run wild among broken glass and piles of dented canned food in a panic.

4) Depending on how seriously you take ""prepping"" keeping your car full of gas isn't a bad idea. We lived in Simi Valley for the northridge quake, and my Dad and brother had to drive all the way to Ventura to find a gas station that was open. Normally a half-hour drive, it was almost 5 hours before they returned home because of the terrified masses trying to gather supplies wherever they could. 

5) Learn first aid. It is good advice whether or not you live in a seismically active zone, but especially when a big disaster strikes. Nobody has time to stitch your cuts, they are too busy trying to save people who are on the brink of death. Even your regular family practice physician is probably cancelling their regular appointments to go help at the hospital so if you have a non-life-threatening emergency you better know how to cope with it on your own  

6) Life was almost back to normal within three weeks (aside from needing to take new longer routes to get places because of destroyed freeways and the reconstruction activities) and I think that has been the case in almost every disaster the US has had, even Katrina.

7) I'm honestly more worried about the effects of Mount Ranier blowing than the Cascadia fault running right under our feet. ",false,false,t1_ct1i08f,sometimesineedhelp,,0,1436772145,t5_2qhad,t3_3d2tej,t3_3d2tej,15,1437813995,0,0,ct1i08f,Seattle,15,,

Obamacare did next to nothing to address this, and instead focused on universal coverage, which even when we achieve that we are still paying vastly too much for it.  


Why do those on the left really applaud this?  It's the centerpiece of legislation passed during the Obama years, and for better or worse, will be the bill he's most remembered for.  

But Obamacare doesn't fix the real problems of pricing transparency, monopolistic pricing, lack of consumer price sensitivity, and an abhorrent lack of competition by providers up and down the supply chain.  Those are the real issues that would lead to cheaper healthcare.  


Why did we blow our load on just achieving more coverage at the same cost?  This seems so far down the chain of shit we should care about when it comes to public health.

"Former Amazon engineer here. Interned and then full time for a while. Had a great time, worked on interesting things, and made some amazing friends.

Problem with many of the FTE horror stories is that they were stuck in a team or org that was just bad and they did nothing about it. Or maybe I just got lucky and ended up in a nice team. The rule for intern projects in my org was that they must be interesting, self-contained, and doable in 3 months. It wasn't schlep work that nobody else wanted to do as OP suggests. It could be things that were nice-to-have but couldn't be done right away because priorities. ""X would be a cool feature but we need Y working in time for launch"" doesn't make X boring.

Regarding exploitation of engineers: Everyone does it. Google, Microsoft, whatever. Amazon is no exception.

So if you leave in the first year you pay what you got back (pro-rated, I believe). Second year, you can leave whenever and keep what you've gotten so far.

Couple tips:

* Don't overwork yourself. Don't work weekends (unless you're on-call in which case only work if you get paged) and don't stay until 7-8 because someone else is staying. Nobody will judge you if you leave at normal times. Just get things done at a reasonable rate. I usually worked 9-5. Stuck around till 6 if we had plans to go get drinks afterwards. Which brings me to my second point.
* Know your team. Socialize with them. Eat and drink with them. This will make your experience infinitely more enjoyable. If you're going back to the team you interned for, you probably already know some of them. If not, get to know them. Try to eat lunch with them most days. Set up a thing to go to a bar together after work once in a while. I cannot stress enough how much this will improve your experience. You'll make some great friends and working around them will very pleasant. Some of the best stories I have from my time in Seattle involve my former coworkers.
* If your team does task estimates (it most likely does), don't be overly optimistic about how long it'll take you to finish the task, and don't overwork yourself in doing it Take what you think it'll take you, assume you're working at 60-75% efficiency, and round it up a bit. That's the estimate you communicate. Under-promise and over-deliver. And if you still find you're behind, don't overwork to catch up. Estimates can be revised. As long as you're not incompetent, you should be fine.
* Don't *ever* feel trapped. Don't ever feel like you have to stay because of X. It'll make you miserable if you think you can't leave. If you don't like it, leave.

"Stations are too far apart.

People only use transit if they can walk to a stop from their home.

Davis to Market is a mile and a half with no stops.  Busses stop 2 or 3 times a mile -- and so do good subways systems like NYC.

"Your wsdot video is from 2009 and was part of the sales pitch for why we needed to tear down the viaduct and replace the seawall, both projects which are now in process (one going faster than the other obviously.)  Both the new seawall and the tunnel are being built to withstand earthquakes.  

Not sure where you're getting your numbers on historic earthquakes here and San Fran, but 9.2 is the largest they think the big offshore fault is capable of producing, and the best the Seattle fault can do is about a 7.5.  They think up to a 10 is theoretically possible other places so I don't also don't know where you're getting ""we should expect the worst earthquakes in the world here""

Not to say that it looks like it will be fun but experts are saying that worst case scenario here still won't be as bad as what Japan went through a few years ago.
