"This area is predominately students who live here. The minority is working professionals, single families or retired folks.

It's going to be tough for students as the rent prices are high due to the luxury models of apartments they're building. Seriously, look at one of those *new* buildings - AVA in U District.

"Not that much older than you, but i grew up homeschooled and spent a lot of time just riding buses around the city with my mom. Pretty much every day i was just out walking the streets, once i was old enough to walk. She had a lot of friends on capitol hill, and i was up there a lot throughout the 90s. 

Everything was way, way grimier. I was weirded out when i was down in LA recently, because some of the scummier parts *really* reminded me of early 90s seattle. 

* Looking out my window, almost every car is newer than my car. Or my parents car. I don't think there's more than a single one in view made in the 90s. Every time i go *anywhere* in town, even lake city at this point, almost every car is at most *maybe* 7 years old max. Even in the early 2000s there were tons of beaters around, and in the 90s i'd say *most* cars looked like shit. Total duct tape shut doored hooptys, unless you were in laurelhurst or something. Lots of people drove volvos back then, but they were *cheapish basic cars*. Volvos gentrified right along with the city itself.

* Similarly, it felt like there were *no* new buildings. Like all construction stopped around maybe... 1975? Like the other post in the thread, everything felt like it had been there forever. The store that gives me this vibe the most, even though it oddly hasn't been there that long, is Al's Games on the ave. It's only a few years old, but it feels like it's been there in that location since the 70s. Shitty door whistling when it's closed, the grimy dimly lit atmosphere, and the building itself is probably 100 years old. Anyone remember any of the old capitol hill video stores like video vertigo? exact same feel.

* Everyone here just had way less money than what seems to be the average now. Having a cell phone stayed some bougie thing here(and by extension ""i don't have a *phone*, stated the same way as ""i don't have a tv"") a few years longer than it seemed to some other bigger places. I had a phone when i was a teenager right after 9/11, and i was one of my *only* friends who did. Everyone always wanted to use it, and everones parents would call me trying to get ahold of them. Whenever i talk to people from other cities they go ""what, *everyone* had cell phones at that point!"". Nowadays every 1st grader on a field trip is waving an iphone or even an ipad around. 

* The buses were terrible. The trolleys were all falling apart stinky 70s hunks of shit that broke down all the time, and so were some of the diesel buses. When was the last time you saw a bus break down? it used to happen like, 1/10 times you'd ride the bus. Especially on the trolleys. The ones that *weren't*(as) old and terrible were 80's M.A.N. buses from germany that were loud, perpetually filthy inside, and had shitty seats. The buses we have now are freaking bentleys compared to the buses then. Going to portland in the mid-late 90s felt like going to the freaking star trek future with the MAX and the nice buses. 

* The actual experiencing of riding the bus was way sketchier. Like, NYC subway in the 80s sketchier. I remember seeing lots of people just openly shooting up, guys shitting on the floor, pissing in the back corner, beating the fuck out of eachother. Mentally ill guys with oxygen tanks screaming about government nerve gas and the man, etc. Syringes in the seats and shit all the time. I saw a guy fuck a prostitute on the 16. Not saying that kind of stuff doesn't still happen, but it felt like every other time i rode the bus until maybe... 2002? a little earlier?

* **EDIT**: A big thing i missed on this, the actual mix of people riding the bus was a *lot* different. If you ride the 8 at 5:30 or 6pm now it's almost entirely people dressed business casual typing on iphones and nexuses. It was unusual to see someone dressed up riding the bus back then. Very, very few ""professional"" looking people would be on most bus routes. It was a much more eclectic mix, even on relatively low-key buses like the 44. Everyone with a ""real job"" drove, or at least it felt that way. 

* There used to be bodegas/mini marts everywhere on capitol hill, and a lot of other neighborhoods. If you go look at google maps street view [from 2007](https://www.google.com/maps/@47.615225,-122.324891,3a,75y,333.86h,86.18t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1spDPMM1ZxpdeN4DVjKSxw5Q!2e0)(heh, did anyone else know it let you view previous years?) even you can see some of the old ones. There's what... one of these left in all of capitol hill now, down on pike? all my high school memories of trying to not get carded buying cigs or beer come from these kinds of places. Ditto to the fast food places that are all gone now, and shout out to the *scary as fuck* old downtown mcdonalds that came before the 3rd and pine one. 

* West seattle and ballard were mentioned, but greenwood and fremont were sketchy and kind of run down too. Lots of older hippies, and just working class people. My parents moved from capitol hill to fremont because it was *cheap*. All the apartment buildings were kind of shitty, and we watched the first townhouses and modern condos get built(there were a FEW 80s/early 90s condo and apartment developments, but seriously maybe... 4 or 5 in the whole neigborhood?). Fremont also wasn't a row of bars and 36th had a completely different character. Ditto for downtown ballard, which was mostly businesses like the little scandanavian deli and other small neighborhood-ish stuff even on market st. Ballard ave was not a wall of restaurants/bars, most of those spaces weren't even customer-facing storefronts but just offices/random commercial spaces or ???

* The burk gilman connection was being fought over even then, hahahaha. Lots of dumb outrage when they built the fred meyers and finished that much of the trail then just did... nothing. It started then.

* Everything was cheap as fuck. Food, entertainment, all of it. Two kids could go to the funplex arcade in ballard/interbay(RIP, it's the staples now) and have fun all afternoon/evening for like $20 and probably even get shitty pizza, sodas, and some candy from the claw machine. Every time i go somewhere else and i get good tacos for $2 or less i remember back to that being the norm. Gorditos felt vaguely expensive, but it was ok because it was a *lot of food*. Now it feels like a lot of food for the normal ass price you pay for a burrito anywhere else... or less, even. On this note i definitely agree on the lack of good food though.

* The rise and fall of pioneer square. Last place to fall was 619/the real artwalk, and a bit before that the OK hotel. Still don't entirely understand exactly what happened, but that was the ""cool"" neighborhood in the sense that capitol hill was for a while/still sort of is. There and well, capitol hill, is where everyone wanted to move. North of the lake might as well have been another city unless you were going to UW. 

* The entire scene of the Ave, ""ave rats"", getting ""kicked off the ave"", etc. It was incredibly territorial and mad max and bizarre, and got worse and worse until they finally cracked down on it in the mid 2000s. Now it's coming back though, with the sidewalk tent camps and shit. It was *weird* in the 90s though, and was one of the only areas of town i was kind of ""banned"" from as a young teen by my mom because it was *so goddamn sketch*. Similar comments about broadway, how the hobos/street kids would all stick to one side of the street and certain territorial spots. Now they all just hang out in very limited spots and in the park and stuff. Broadway used to be a solid wall of oogles, same with the ave. Busking, harassing people, trying to sell you drugs. Whatever you see now, imagine it just copy pasted over itself 3-4 times. It was like the shittiest corners of folklife every day. There's an AMAZING comment somewhere in /r/seattle by someone who was a street kid in that scene in the late 90s that's pages long, and it's a super great read. Wish i remembered how to find it. 

* Also as mentioned, there was always whinging about tech companies and the rent. Microsoft was the old amazon, and it was cool to hate. I remember wearing a microsoft shirt i got at goodwill as a joke, and all my friends giving me sarcastic shit for it. It would be like wearing a monsanto shirt now. Similarly, the complaint was stuff like our giant two bedroom apartment in fremont going from $500 to $1000 in the space of a couple years. Now that same apartment is condos... 

* Human scale architecture. Outside of downtown, it was extremely unusual to find a building taller than 3 stories. Almost all of broadway was single story, or maybe two floors. Same with the ave(although that's almost still the same). And *especially* in ballard/fremont/etc. Was it efficient? No, not really... but it just feels VERY different now walking around a neighborhood. Lots more light made it in. A lot of broadway and other areas feels cavernous and shadowy now even on a sunny day.

"This was my first job as a bricklayer apprentice and it amazing to watch this building go up. Most of our work was in the parking garage, stairwells, electrical rooms, ventilation shafts...Everything was grey. We worked this job thru the winter, 10 hour shifts and would enter the garage with the sun still down and leave for the day in a grey dark mist of sundown. Driving home with my arms in my lap from exhaustion. I didn't see the sunlight for months. 



One late February day, I grabbed my lunch and walked onto the man lift just as the lift operator was starting up. He knew I had no reason to be going up but whatever. I was 17 and looked 12. He just laughed and said this is gonna take awhile. I think it was around 60 stories at this point. A few iron workers jump on and up we go. They gave me shit the whole way up. In a good way though. The last 10-15 floors of the ride up were pretty much just open iron structure and some random areas of decking. No one working on any of these floors. Of course my knees start to give. The man lift is basically bolted on to a 900' tall Tinkertoy. 



I step out with these guys a few floors from the top and realize for the first time how frickin high I am. The view was incredible. The sun had cleared a bit, it looked like I was taller than Mt. Rainier. The only safety here is some steel angles welded to the edge with two horizontal cables running the perimeter. I nibble on my PB&amp;J and hit the call button for the lift. 



He came back up to get me and the other guys 2 1/2 hours later at quitting time. After about an hour I head up a ladder to the next couple floors where the guys are welding off the angles for the upper floors and running the cable. The just tell me to enjoy the view.



Missed the rest of the day, my foreman thought I quit and said he should fire me. Well worth the ass chewing.

Furthermore, the homeless have few resources to relocate from very far just to access Seattle's food banks or handful of tent cities. ",false,false,t1_cq4o2m5,jakobim,,0,1428447054,t5_2qhad,t3_31sn0i,t1_cq4mjo9,17,1432255714,0,0,cq4o2m5,Seattle,17,,
"Just to reiterate a previous (and very, very, **VERY** relevant) [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/33pzsc/sound_transit_conceptual_study_doesnt_include/) -- the Sound Transit proposals (which will become ST3) presented so far are extremely disappointing. Essentially Seattle taxpayers will be paying for extending the light rail spine out into the hinterlands, diverting money away from transit projects inside the city itself.

I understand that this article primarily deals with downtown Seattle's transit capacity. However, the larger issue is that ST3, which is our best chance at getting decent transit in our lifetimes, will disproportionately favor transit investments in remote low-density areas, diverting Seattle money away from Seattle transit, and handicapping future transit investments by building half-assed ones instead.

This is potentially the most important fight we need to make if we want quality transit *in Seattle*. Please read this Seattle Transit Blog [analysis](http://seattletransitblog.com/2015/04/24/sound-transits-conceptual-study-should-you-be-worried/), and, if you feel the same way, complain to the Sound Transit [board members](http://www.soundtransit.org/About-Sound-Transit/Board-of-Directors/Board-members).",false,false,t1_cqrjufx,blueautomaton,,0,1430236921,t5_2qhad,t3_345tk1,t3_345tk1,47,1432653189,0,0,cqrjufx,Seattle,47,,

"I don't think there's much need to work from home or otherwise be worried about the daytime protests. Those are the cool ones - they're legal, organized in advance, and advocate for things that we can all agree with, like equal opportunity and fairness. Those folks express their opinions, make their point heard, and all is well, with a pretty good and positive impact made in the community.

Most recent exception being 2012 when everyone gathered in Westlake around noon and then did what they did.

At 6:00PM, the Anti-Capitalist march gathers at Seattle Central Community College. The past two years have been relatively peaceful, with these folks just roaming up and down, talking tough and being up past their bedtime. This one also attracts the out of town hooligans, and is the one most people aren't too sure about. It could be like last year's, or it could be something different altogether. I've heard rumors from all sides of the spectrum about potential activities, but they're just whispers and nothing solid.

Here's the facts to take into consideration about why there's reason to be concerned:

- The 6:00PM rally is supported and attended by most of the major radical, left wing extremist groups 
- May Day attracts people from all around the region and surrounding states who are looking to either protest or do damage
- May 1st is a Friday, so no school or work for a lot of people the following day
- The weather will be pleasant
- The Police department has been on their tip-toes around recent protests, and their tactics in recent months of having lightly armed bike cops followed by a huge arsenal of riot police leads to concern about how effectively they can control the crowd proper and splinter groups if they scatter (it's good for crowd control if the group is all bunched up in one area, but not if they span over multiple blocks)
- National events have infuriated many people and are sparking cause for protest, as well as extreme animosity towards police departments nationwide.

Here's the fact to take into consideration about why there's no reason to be concerned:

- The kids that attend these protests are all talk and will chant about killing cops, but all of them are too afraid of getting arrested or grounded and not being able to post on Reddit if they do anything.

**How YOU can help your city!**

- Report any suspicious items by calling 911 (i.e. abandoned briefcase/package in an odd spot, etc).
- Likewise report any suspicious activity. If you see a crime in progress, dial 911. 
- Check newspaper containers and other public hiding places for rocks and other assorted throwable items. Throw them away.
- Clear obstructions. If you see sandwich boards, newspaper bins, garbage cans, etc lying in the street, replace them to the sidewalk.

"We just bought a place in the Junction area and love it. I think it is very underrated. I work from home and my wife walks to work, so we don't need to deal with any of the traffic issues mentioned though. Most everything we need is in a two by two block area, so everything is within walking distance and it is definitely easy to just end up spending most of your time in West Seattle. Some of my favorite things about it:

Pros

* Bought a 3 bedroom townhouse in the 300's. Mortgage + taxes and everything is less than what we were paying in rent for a small 1BR in First Hill near Pike/Pine.
* Great views. Walking around Edmunds/Alaska St, seeing mountains in both directions, and looking over the Sound.
* Less hipsters/bros/posers, less people coming to the neighborhood just to get wasted and leaving a mess. 
* I genuinely believe people are friendlier, easier to talk to here. They are less transient and more settled in the neighborhood. I know a lot more people's names now and see familiar faces, and see some more smiles/eye contact. 
* Food and drink is a little cheaper. It is nice to go to Easy St. and get a good breakfast for 4.50 and coffee for 1.00. 
* You are in walking distance of so many grocery stores, maybe too many. I can walk to Trader Joe's, QFC, Safeway, PCC, Metropolitan Market, Thriftway, and the Sunday Farmer's Market. They are building a Whole Foods in the area by the end of next year also. 
* Bakery Nouveau, Shadowland, Talarico's, Fiddleheads, Bang Bar, Verite, Husky Deli, Ma'ono Fried Chicken and Whiskey, Poggie Tavern, Beer Junction, West 5, West Side Pub
* Watching football at The Bridge and Beveridge
* Seeing a jazz/blues/comedy show and having a sazerac at the Feedback Lounge.
* Walking around Alki or Lincoln Park on a sunny day
* There are a ton of bar trivia nights, poker nights, and other community events that you can follow on the West Seattle Blog. The neighborhood feels very connected and I feel informed of all the new businesses and projects.
* We enjoy heading over to Columbia City and Georgetown nearby

Cons

* I used to walk to all of the music venues from our old apartment - Neumo's, Paramount, Barboza, Triple Door, Chop Suey, etc. So if I want to see a show now, I ride the Rapid Ride C downtown, which is really easy. I usually take an Uber home since I don't always feel like hanging around 3rd and Pike when I've had some drinks and am headed home late. The Rapid Ride also continues on to Ballard, so we can go to the Sunset and Tractor Tavern also, which is cool. 
* I hear traffic is bad going downtown, but again, I just get on the Rapid Ride and listen to music, so don't really notice.

"Totally random order here :

Join /r/seattlebike as well and follow seattle bike blog. They have interesting stuff. 

Get long fenders. They protect you and your fellow riders.  

Get lights and use them. Wear reflective clothing and stay visible. Staying healthy is nice. 

Obey traffic laws. This includes stop signs and lights. Some riders you will see will blow through them, don't be that person. Chose to maintain order in the city. 

Ride with friends to get a hang for the city and the best bike routes. This also helps gain confidence. 

Get a good lock. Cable locks are not so good. Don't get your bike stolen. 

Respect pedestrians and cars and most will respect you. Some will not. Try not to take it too personally. 

When it comes to hills there's almost always an easier route. You may go more miles but you can save a steep grade until you are more fit. Use the Seattle bike map and google maps to look at grades. 

As to roller blades, I see them semi-frequently. It's not a problem as long as the people are aware of their surroundings , aware of other bikes and people and corteous when passing or being passed. 

Oh also, try to not wear headphones. Enjoy the sounds of city and stay more aware.

He's hugely increasing cash flow requirements while reducing profits at the same time. It's probably a nice tax break for him this way, but if he truly wants to do right by employees, and still be able to leverage his capital to grow the business he shouldn't be raising salaries so high IMO. 

If he would have cut his $1M salary to $70k/year, used the extra $900k+/year to grow the business somehow, and started up profit sharing for everyone but himself (he has likely banked millions already and also realizes the increased value of the company through equity ownership, so he doesn't need profit sharing), then there is a very good chance employees could end up making much more than $70k/year ($900k+ per year in free cash flow is an amazing amount of capital to grow any business with) *and* the employees would be more motivated, focused, and invested in the company's future profit.",false,false,t1_cqc27vh,jerephil,,0,1429026348,t5_2qhad,t3_32izl5,t1_cqc1bod,10,1432385708,0,0,cqc27vh,Seattle,10,,

Try to mind where the curb-ramps are and not stop between them where there are no stop lines/marked crosswalks. Every intersection/direction is a crosswalk unless specifically prohibited by signs. 

Safe cycling would dictate the cyclist not be on the sidewalk at all (Especially on a downhill, jesus christ), but, in Seattle it is perfectly legal to ride on the sidewalk, no matter how stupid it is to do it.

The number for Tacoma PD that is on the poster is the *general non-emergency number* for South Sound not a number to a detective or to the missing persons department. Its actually not even for Tacoma PD, its for the Pierce County Sheriffs. Again, its not wrong for the number to go to them, its just a weird detail to get wrong.

2)  After initially being upset towards Dick regarding the decision to sell, I later learned that Dick was in fact ""dicked"" over by his other 2 original business partners at Elysian, VP David Buhler and CEO Joe Bisacca.  Dick was on the wrong end of a 2-1 vote to sell to AB when his business partners started seeing dollar signs.  Knowing that, it's now clear to me that Dick brought all the integrity to the party, but as the most public figurehead of the company he ironically ended up taking almost all of the heat for the AB deal.  While we may never know the exact details, I empathize greatly with Dick and can't imagine what it's like to be in his shoes right now.  I don't envy his situation, here's wishing him the best.

"For the record, I am born and raised in the greater Seattle area. Been here all 29 years of my life. Seattle (and it's suburbs) are pretty busy areas with busy people who already have their close group of friends and time commitments. We aren't unfriendly, but we also don't actively go out of our way a whole lot to make new friends out of the blue. My friends are all friends of friends or people I met at some group activity. For example, nights at the bar meeting friends of friends, 4th of july / summer bbq parties where I met friends of friends who became friends, days at the shooting range, etc.

If you try and strike up everyday conversation with people at like...a gas station, or the store, or a restaurant? You aren't going to have very much luck. We'll be polite, but for the most part we have other things to do and other things planned. If you bump into us at an event or group activity where there's a common interest to discuss and get to know you a bit? Different story, we'll get to talking and have actual time to get to know each other a bit and likely become friends. I realize this may be slightly different from other states (and certainly seems different in places like Europe, for example, from my one trip there), but that's just how it is here. It's rainy, it's wet, we're busy, we don't really know you, and we've got a ton of plans already. You seem nice but if we aren't somewhere where there's time to chat and have some common ground to start a conversation with, there won't be much conversation happening.

All that said? Once you make friends by being in a place where it's likely to happen, try and follow up. It goes back to the whole ""busy"" bit. And don't be annoyed if we can't do something that day, or even that week. I have some friends that I chat with online only because we are both so busy, or I only see them a handful of times a year. My best friends from Middle School / High School I still see at least once a week if not more, and talk with nearly every night. We stick to our small circles of friends quite a bit around here, and if you want to be a part of that, that's cool, but it takes time. I'm sorry if that's not exactly the answer you're looking for, but it's just how it is.

"Two-Hour Rule

What happens if you’ve already missed your flight? It happens. Luckily for you, there is a little-known rule in the airline industry that is known as the two-hour rule, or the flat-tire rule. This is an actual policy at US Airways and Southwest as well as several other airlines, but it isn’t publicized. 

Essentially, if there are circumstances beyond your control, like a huge accident on the highway en route to the airport, you may get a little extra help. The two-hour rule states that if a passenger arrives within two hours of their missed flight, the airline employee can put you on the next flight with the same airline on standby at no charge. If you miss the last flight of the day, you’ll be standby on the first flight the next day. 

Pro Tip: If you have membership status with the airline you’re flying, sometimes you can get a little extra help. Do be sure to mention this.

"Growing up on Bainbridge really taught me how big of a deal the internment was for the island. Little known fact if you're not from the island, but Bainbridge was actually the very first place in the entire country to see its Japanese-Americans removed. This memorial is at the site where the dock they were taken from used to sit, and its a fantastic memorial. One thing that struck me when I first went was just how familiar its names were; Koura, Sakai, Nakata, and others are names you see all around the island, from roads to schools, and their histories are linked to Bainbridge and the surrounding area. The history of the Japanese-Americans on the island goes way back, in fact an archeological dig is ongoing on a small village on the south end which was home to something like 100 Japanese immigrant workers at the Blakely Mill. I recall seeing a photo at the Historical Society museum that showed the class of '41 versus the class of '42 at Bainbridge High School, where they left empty seats on stage at graduation to represent those who had been interned. So many faces gone. Though by no means were all the white island residents good people during the whole issue, there were some who defied the blatant racism that triggered the internments. The Bainbridge Review, for instance, which was ran by Walt and Millie Woodward (after whom one of the schools is named), was the only paper on the west coast to publicly come out against the internment, and even made sure to keep contacts with islanders in the camps so that their news could be printed in the paper.",false,false,t1_cq5ptuk,gshenck,University of Washington,0,1428523508,t5_2qhad,t3_31weua,t3_31weua,11,1432274645,0,0,cq5ptuk,Seattle,11,,flair

&gt; 100% of this surcharge will be distributed to our staff in either wages or benefits. If there is a surplus, we will distribute it to current hourly staff at the end of the calendar year as a bonus and adjust the surcharge for the next calendar year.

THAT is fair and probably vastly easier for bookkeeping purposes than a simple 2% raise of price across the board. This lets them cleanly break out labor from everything else (like market rates for food, etc). It's a superficially tacky thing at first glance but rather clever afterward, like how Ivar's is giving all staff profit sharing now.

"I haven't found anything to dislike yet. I think it's the nicest, after having lived for several years each in 5 different states. I think the ""seattle freeze"" is just people learning how to socialize. I think the traffic is comparable to any major city. I think the housing is as expensive as any major city. There has always been a tradeoff between higher rent for closer in locations versus longer commute times in exchange for cheaper rent. Every city is nearly the same, only the weather, major employers, and food choices are different. 

I think the people complaining are people who just graduated and believe that they really should have a 1 BR luxury apartment in the city center with free parking for $600/mo. and that they're above renting a room in a house with strangers, a six figure job out of college with no experience other than reading books about the subject and doing their homework each week then saying they're ""overqualified"", learning that their friends will grow apart and get married and start families and that's life and of course it's easier to meet people in a campus environment.

No. Businesses are responsible for collecting the sales tax by the purchaser, and then paying that sales tax to the state. So, the sales tax is never supposed to go to the business at all. 

Besides that, if you're poor enough, or you spend enough, you can collect the sales tax on your receipts and see if they add up enough to count towards your taxes (because you're not supposed to be taxed twice). That's why you can submit big ticket items like a car toward your year end tax refunds.

"I always find the economics of frugal folks fascinating. Please don't hear that as judgement, just a difference. The median household income is [67k per year in Seattle](http://www.deptofnumbers.com/income/washington/seattle/). I imagine that we can agree that the average household isn't going to buy a home in Seattle? 

But let's assume the scenario of 90k for a single person with a take home of $5200. [The average rent in Seattle is $1300.](http://www.deptofnumbers.com/income/washington/seattle/) So that leaves $3900. Phone, cable, internet, $250 = $3750. Power/Gas $150 =3600. We should assume a auto payment as it is very common. Let's go cheap at $250 - $3350. Insurance and fuel $150 per month = $3200. Clothing food and miscellaneous on the IRS [shows $585](http://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&amp;-Self-Employed/National-Standards-Food-Clothing-and-Other-Items) = $2615. Student debt averages $29000 which at 6.8% interest which is a $333 payment = $2282. So for dinner's out, entertainment, and other incidentals, people should budget $282? 

I concede that there are places to save on this budget. But this presumes that we are first making nearly 50% more than the average household income as a single person. To meet your spending standards we have make a good living, choose housing below that income, be pretty dedicated to saving in that we make sure we watch all the bills very closely and if we don't, we have a ""spending problem""? I would suggest that it's a pretty harsh judgement. 

There is another way to view life. I am fortunate and unfortunate. My wife lost her mother at 40 years old. My father died before 60. As a result, we choose to live life. The last thing I'm going to do is die having not lived. I've been to 15 countries since 2006. I've done a lot of fun things. Many of our friends look to our lives and see their bucket list finished. Do I have a huge bank account? Nope. Do I have savings and retirement covered, yes.

"&gt;Court documents show Sharma was arrested by University of Washington police in 2002 for indecent liberties after he allegedly approached a stranger and ran his fingers through her hair and then down her face, while making kissing sounds. He grabbed her breast and made crude, sexual comments.

&gt; When she pulled away, he shouted profanities at her, according to court records.

&gt; In 2003, Sharma was convicted of third-degree assault for approaching a woman, wrapping his arm around her neck and grabbing her breast, court documents show.

&gt; Also in 2003, court documents say the man was convicted of fourth-degree assault for grabbing a woman’s buttocks.

&gt; He was ordered to register as a sex offender after a 2011 conviction for felony assault with sexual motivation and a subsequent flight to Oregon.

&gt; In February 2012, he was sentenced to 20 months in prison for third-degree assault after he grabbed a woman’s breast as she sat on a bench at University Village.

&gt; He served five months with credit for the time he served in jail, according to the Corrections Department.

&gt; According to charges filed in that case, the woman told Seattle police that the suspect interrupted her and introduced himself.

&gt; The woman told police she politely shook his outstretched hand and then he reached down, rubbed her head and grabbed for her left breast.

"You're working on two different assumptions, neither of you is wrong in light of those frames.

What I think/hope /u/themandotcom is alluding to is the idea the park and rides aren't as effective as development based solutions. Park and rides fill up, but they still have people driving to and from the park and ride, whereas not allowing for park and rides encourages sustainable development around transit hubs. Not only does this further reduce automobile dependence for your standard ""into the city"" commuter, but it also creates/enhances new/existing neighborhoods. [Cumberland](https://goo.gl/maps/1YIUJ) outside Chicago is a seriously busy park and ride station, and it's a wasteland. To be fair, it's on the far outskirts of suburban Chicago, and currently fits its location, but that's what we don't want or need for most of Seattle's initial phases of construction. Ballard, Lake City, West Seattle, etc, don't need park and rides, they need efficient connections to the rest of Seattle for the existing population. 

In other words, park and rides facilitate a car-centric development model by diffusing existing traffic, and partially limiting the need to drive, rather than functioning as a viable total automobile replacement. This has value, for sure. But while this is great for something like Enumclaw to downtown, that's not the only need we have. I would go so far as to argue it's not even the primary need.

"As a transportation researcher I think people get way too riled up about this. There are a number of issues with higher speed limits that make it a good idea to veto it, even if it is to intentionally kill it with process:

* Speed kills. Faster speeds kill more. Even small increases in speed limits can be associated with dramatic increases in fatal accidents because a) severity of impacts b) reaction time. Any study that goes against this logic is similar in quality to studies that argue climate change might not be taking place. Even in Germany with no speed limits they recognize that it has a cost in terms of more fatal accidents.

* The fuel efficiency goes down considerably above 50 mph and worsen exponentially. The US already has one of the worlds worst emission rates for transportation, and this will only make matters worse. Sure, Washington is just one state, but it is already setting a precedent on many areas in terms of sustainability.

* You don't save that much time. Really, the travel time savings are marginal at best. Especially if you start calculating door-to-door travel time instead of only time spent on the free-way (which is how you should be calculating in the first place).

* People argue most people are already going 75. Well if you raise the speed limit to 75 they are going 80. If you raise it to 80 they are going 85. People will always drive faster than the limit no matter what you set it at. With that argument you might as just remove it since you can keep going up. Observed behaviour doesn't necessarily mean desired behaviour and is not something you should plan for if it goes against other goals.

Its fine to disagree with the veto but lets not act like its the end of democracy.

"Lots of things to remember about this...

* It started as a phenomenon occurring because of Bellevue College which has no dormitories. 
* This was to close a loophole that many out of country parents were exploiting to buy a home near the college, move their student children into it and then packing with other nationals going to Bellevue College.
* There is nothing wrong with that practice if the area is zoned for it. These areas are not.
* Building codes exist for a reason. Most of the time safety is that reason. To scab in eight bedrooms in a house designed for three likely violates many firecodes and water/sewage capacity requirements.
* As UW housing has become more scarce, more and more King County cities are having to deal with this issue and are passing similar laws. Auburn has had one for years, and actively enforces compliance, i.e. doesn't wait for neighbors to complain.
* ""Four"" was not an arbitrary number. I'm 100% sure it was well-researched and determined by Bellevue's legal staff to be a reasonable and legally defendable number. Remember, WA cities still have to stay compliant with Federal and State Fair Housing laws.

* This will likely just be a short term fix. Bellevue College and Bellevue are going to have to seriously deal with student housing.

Traffic was a lot worse in terms of the amount of people traveling in two lanes, but it wasn't ever as bad as it is here today. The aggressive driving style on the east was something that I adapted to and loved because you are always moving, there isn't those times where it's like, ""oh we're stopped let me check Facebook, oh we are going, repeat""(which is just part of the reason the traffic is so bad during rush hour). 

At times when there was a medium traffic flow people always moved out of the way if you are approaching on the left. I feel like the mentality is this:

Boston, ""someone is trying to pass me, they need to get some where faster than I do, therefore, I will move. ""

"Well. It's complicated. Mountains usually give a few days notice, but they ""cry wolf"" a lot. So most people don't bother to move when they start acting up. It's indeterminate wether the mountain will blow or not when it does start acting up. They test their lahar sirens in Pierce county (places like Orting, Puyallup, etc) but Once those go off, you only have a matter of an hour or two to get to high ground IIRC. Water moves at up to 60 miles per hour, and its only 60 miles away, so assuming it averages 30 - that's not a lot of time for the Puyallup/white/carbon River Valley if the mountain collapses to the north. 

If the lahar is big enough, Kent, Renton, and potentially South Seattle are also in for it, and I've never ever heard anybody talk about having preparations for a lahar in Kent, having grown up there. They should, but they don't. Kent can barely deal with seasonal rainstorms in the valley, let alone a mountain blowing up nearby...

"Postmates screwed up on prices listed.

http://www.pinkyskitchen.com/

You also got entirely different line items at different prices with that challenger platter.  It's about $15 more because of that.  Then they charged you mandatory 10% gratuity (for the BBQ place), a 19% service fee on after-tip amount (to Postmates or the driver) and the $9.75 delivery fee (based on distance, most likely for the driver).

Issues:

* Prices are wrong on the Postmates website (by only a few dollars) for the actual items you ordered.  Could be a recent change.
* They didn't upcharge you the $5 for the platters on the Postmates site when you added two sides to each meat order.
* The restaurant used different platter pricing entirely and charged you $3 extra for a side (not sure why), bringing prices up ~$15 (pre-tax).  Not sure why, could be a change in the menu.
* Postmates didn't tell you about the mandatory 10% gratuity for the restaurant.

Everything else is fine to me.  Delivery charge and service fees look normal.  You actually paid what the restaurant charges for what you ordered and the fees you agreed to.  Perhaps there were some mistakes made in the actual way it was ordered because the line items are strange...or a cashier was ""helping""...or prices have changed.  Regardless, you didn't get screwed, you just got bad information up front.

Other than that mysterious $15 discrepancy due to the line item substitution by the restaurant, Postmates just needs to update the pricing and put up a warning about mandatory gratuity to the restaurant.  They have done that for Luna Park Cafe for example.

"The state government has gone an extreme amount out of their way to do something that very few, if anyone desires. A few people have stated that they heard that ""people are abusing the system"" (I'd bet cash half of these people just have a youthful fashion) and, while this doesn't directly affect them, in that oh-so-typical fashion here, they need to control it anyway.

You're asking why people will go back to the black market?  Because while people are not entirely rational beasts, they aren't entirely irrational either. Just because the state thinks they can corral medical patients into any fenced-in area they want, and the group will just blindly follow, really ignores human behavior.

The state government, both with medical and recreational cannabis, is beyond dropping the ball. It's some sort of reversion to early 2000s America. People won't follow, because they're not being led, they're being corralled.

"&gt;Not really, King County residents soundly rejected raising car tabs to prevent Metro bus cuts.

I didn't say, ""If you win Seattle, you win the vote."" I said, ""...if you lose Seattle, you lose the vote."" They are fundamentally different statements.

&gt; So it could lose the Seattle vote, but the rest of the county would vote in favor of it. 

We're not talking about counties; we're talking about subareas. And in these plans Sound Transit is proposing to raid the coffers of the North and East King County subareas in order to pay to build out rail to the low-density burbs that don't have enough people to pay for it themselves. And as a consolation prize Ballard, the area with the biggest unserved concentration of ridership in this entire region gets a glorified streetcar. Jesus Christ, that's insane.

So to reiterate the validity of my previous ""lose Seattle, lose the vote"" sentence, I went and crunched some numbers. Here are the 2013 subarea population figures, [according to Sound Transit](http://www.soundtransit.org/Documents/pdf/about/financial/2013/15%20Year%20Subarea%20Sources%20and%20Uses%20Schedules%202009-2023.docx):

Subarea|Population
:--|:--
Snohomish|425,109
Pierce|676,669
North King|690,528
South King|506,633
East King|515,285

And here are the results for the [2008 ST2 election](http://old.seattletimes.com/flatpages/nationworld/politics/election2008completeresultsballotmeasures.html):

County|Yay|Nay
:--|:--|:--
Snohomish|55%|45%
Pierce|51%|49%
King|61%|39%

Now *assuming* (and this is a big assumption) that the same percentage of people in each area vote for ST3 as they did for ST2, and this is using 2013's population ratios, that gives a total Yay for Snohomish and Pierce at 52% and Nay of 48%.

Now again using the 2008 voting results and 2013 population, assuming that the same percentage of people in Snohomish and Pierce vote each way, **to make the vote fail King County as a whole will have to only vote 52% Nay**.
North and East King, the two areas of King County that would get the shaft in these plans, make up 70% of the population of King County's subareas. The Eastside is already tax-averse, so they'll be an easier sell to vote Nay (see the bus vote you pointed out). But if you get *Seattle* to vote strongly Nay as well (the recent Seattle monorail vote was 80% Nay), then this plan is DOA.

&gt;Entire county is paying for light rail, but its mostly to the benefit of Seattle

This comment is completely wrong and is actually the reverse of reality.

Each *subarea* (not county) pays into the ST funds, and according to subarea equity the proportion of funding that each subarea pays gets spent in that subarea. This is why it's tough to build rail out to the hinterlands... because there aren't enough people who live there to pay for it. Hence why these new plans are complete bullshit--subarea equity was originally meant to 'protect' the suburbs from paying for Seattle infrastructure, but now the day has come where the suburbs realize that they can't actually afford to build rail to their areas, so they're conveniently forgetting the original subarea agreement--originally mean to 'protect' themselves--and are now raiding the funds from Seattle and the Eastside.

To help answer your question -  

They can't hang aerial over someone else's property. It's known as aerial trespassing and,  as the name would imply, illegal. The neighbor would be well within their rights to cut it down. As its empty now it's not a big deal,  but what happens when they sell it and the new owners don't want it there? There are also other considerations. You have to maintain height clearances so if you are off the road a ways and there is not a jump pole it is about impossible as the weight of the line causes it to sag too much. 

As for sharing a conduit,  it is pretty much never done. As a general rule you don't want to be responsible for damage to the other drop that's in the conduit trying to fish a new line in. Working for a cable company I don't have the right wires to replace it if I break a fiber or telephone drop and vice versa.  And your competitor isn't going to be cheap about replacing it either. Also, considering the current company probably invested at least a thousand to run the conduit to get the drop to the house,   they don't  want to let their competitor take advantage of their infrastructure.  

That is all even if the conduit goes to the correct poles. The only time it's feasible is in an aerial to underground area,  where the distribution lines are aerial but the drop lines to the residence are underground.  And even then,  the tap or splice point could be on different poles so it would be completely unfeasible.  

Your best bet would be to either purchase the line and conduit and run the drop yourself or have an electrical contractor do it for you. Alternatively I would imagine CL would pay to bury a conduit if you signed a contract so they could recoup their losses. 

I guess I should mention I am in no way saying this as a representative of any company,  this is just my experience over the years. I've worked for Comcast, Google Fiber,  Qwest and others as a cable gypsy in a couple different states over 10+ years and they are all pretty close to standardised now.

A)Her ""small business"" is a franchise operation.(Not a ""mom and pop""), and apparently because of that she is being held to the stricter timeline that a large business needs to. Whether this is due to internal Zpizza franchise contracts or the law counting her as a part of the Zpizza company is unclear. This seems unfair.

However, B) she was most likely going to close anyway, and is just blaming the minimum wage. Looking the place up, it's a 3.5 star rated business centered on providing gluten-free, vegan pizza in an awful location. ""We should set up shop in a location infamous for a 20-something hipster crowd vastly more concerned with booze &amp; hooking up than food!"" Oh no, doing poorly? Must be the economics of the minimum wage hike as opposed to a poor business model being executed in a bad location.

C)Her lamentations about where her employees will go, and how everyone must be cutting hours is false. 14 pizza places in Seattle have posted jobs in the past week(http://www.workingwa.org/.../about-that-story-on-zpizza...), more than the number of people who work at that one location. If it were a cause of major hours cutting, larger companies would have started firing first, since they actually have finance departments that can accurately project costs and revenues. Seattle area unemployment hit a new low for the year as of March.

Yes the minimum wage increase will cause some businesses to close, and others to change. But let's get over this minimum wage ruins everything myth:

The amount of people who actually lose their job over a min wage increase will be very small compared to those who do benefit from an increased min wage. Remember that most min wage earners work for very large, very profitable corporations, and the mom and pops employing under X employees are either exempt or receive tax credits to compensate the increased overhead.
So this whole argument is not very valid.
These people who benefit from an increased min wage will now have a increase in spending power. This extra spending will be pumped directly back into local businesses anyways... so yes their payroll overhead may have increased, but their daily sales will increase as more people have more cash in their pocket to spend.",false,false,t1_cqtal1s,The_Antigamer,,0,1430353436,t5_2qhad,t3_34c5k9,t3_34c5k9,72,1432683140,0,0,cqtal1s,Seattle,72,,

"Washington State has a property tax cap of $10 per $1,000 of assessed value, also called the ""1% cap.""  This is, confusingly, different from the **other** 1% cap that limits the amount property tax revenue collections can rise year-over-year, but that's not relevant to this, so sorry for the aside.

The $10/$1000 cap is, by law, divided between the state ($3.60 max) and anything-but-the-state ($5.90 limit) with a $0.50 statutory reserve.  This levy is written such that $0.07 of the anything-but-the-state capacity would be approved by the voters for use with this project.

If property values drop, the taxing entities (city, county, special districts) will generally raise their effective tax rates so that the same amount of dollars will be collected.  However, if values drop by too much, the limit will be hit.  This is a problem if the tax revenue has been used as collateral for bonds.  Fire districts are separate from the county and can impose their own taxes but within the limits of the property tax system.  The statement in opposition believes that fire districts--which are junior to counties when it comes to setting tax levies--would be required to lower their tax rates so that the countywide radio levy could still pay off its bonds.

I happily voted yes because this levy is so relatively small that I don't believe it to be a concern, even if property values take a nosedive.  Other levies, like the Social Services levy or the Library District levy (latter does not apply in Seattle, we aren't part of KCLS), are not used to secure bonds so they can be stalled or reduced in such an event because the votes authorizing them permitted an ""up to"" dollar amount, not a fixed quantity.",false,false,t1_cqi1dym,somenewuser,Central Area,0,1429493424,t5_2qhad,t3_336emf,t3_336emf,28,1432488995,0,0,cqi1dym,Seattle,28,,flair

The comments to this video are what really demoralizes me about living in Seattle. I'm from Arizona where we call people who bash people moving there for economic opportunities ""Republicans""...

Maybe I'm just being overly sensitive, but it really gets to me knowing I live somewhere where 99% of a random sampling of people hate me and wish I would move away, or ""kill myself"" to listen to the less moderate there. Everyone I knew in Tucson (which is **much** poorer and more unemployed than Seattle, inside or out of tech) was super happy for me and thought it was super cool that I was moving up here to work at a well-known company, and I was totally shocked by the attitude of most people here.

I never thought or cared about making a lot of money. I was a weird kid my whole life, got bullied for being a nerd, et cetera. Turned out by sheer luck that my particular weirdo hobbies happened to coincide with what happens to be a growing sector of the economy at this particular moment in history, so that's what I ended up getting a job doing. Now it turns out I'm responsible for everything from gay and trans bashing to people not being able to afford their homes. (FWIW I share a 2-bedroom in Ballard for $1450/mo total of which my share is $800. I room with a UW grad student).

I'm not sure what to do other than move to somewhere less ""hip"", where I'm more welcome, and I am strongly considering doing that. But it really gets to me a lot.

Seattle has the lowest density of the three. An important aspect of planning is not sprawling to destroy rural lands. Seattle can, and must build up. Housing on the periphery is only cheaper in absolute terms, not when you consider necessary infrastructure (that can't be funded by a diffuse tax base) and poor transit (due to lack of density) forcing people to overspend on cars and overpollute. Building up is the solution when all things are considered.",false,false,t1_cqphqr9,poopinmymouthbirds,,0,1430079425,t5_2qhad,t3_33xbrg,t1_cqph44t,10,1432617686,0,0,cqphqr9,Seattle,10,,

"From /r/mapporn, explaining this whole boondoggle to the non-Seattleites:

Source: ""The Rapid Transit Plan for the Metropolitan Seattle Area"" published by the De Leuw, Cather &amp; Company on February 19, 1970, for the Forward Thrust project. Scanned at the Seattle Central Library.

The Forward Thrust rapid transit plan was put to two votes in the late 1960s, during the height of subway expansion sponsored by the federal government. Seattle was, at the time, pushing back against a large freeway plan (including the infamous R.H. Thomson Expressway and the lesser-known [Bay Freeway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Freeway_(Seattle\))), so it seemed to be a perfect time to propose replacing their failing bus system with a shiny new subway.

The first vote was held on February 13, 1968, with a promise of $765 million in federal funding secured in exchange for a local contribution of $385 million. The ballot measure [was approved by 50.8% of voters, but failed to gain the required 60% to pass](http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&amp;File_Id=2168).

A second attempt was done two years later, on May 19, 1970, with $881 million from the feds and $440 million from Seattle for what was basically the same plan. The ballot measure [failed, with only 46% approval](http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&amp;File_Id=3961), in the middle of high unemployment and uncertainty caused by the ""Boeing bust"".

Seattle eventually got around to building rail transit, with Link Light Rail being approved by voters in 1996. The first real line opened in 2009, connecting downtown to the airport, with a tunnel extension to the University of Washington's Husky Stadium planned to open next March. It, along with part of the next northern extension, follows part of the northeastern line.

The planned and approved [East Link light rail line](http://www.soundtransit.org/Projects-and-Plans/East-Link-Extension) almost exactly parallels the eastern route of Forward Thrust, from Seattle to Bellevue and Redmond via the same basic corridor. The northwestern line to Ballard and southeastern line to Renton are both being studied by Sound Transit for future light rail extensions, to be put to a vote in November 2016.",false,false,t1_cpzfcc0,SounderBruce,Snohomish County,0,1428017471,t5_2qhad,t3_31907j,t3_31907j,14,1432163870,0,0,cpzfcc0,Seattle,14,,flair

"General rules of thumb. Usually noise can go on from 7 AM to 10 PM Monday through Friday. On the weekends it""s 9 AM to 7. If you are downtown, that can be extended one hour in each direction with a variance. Occasionally, say when a tower crane is being erected or dismantled, they need more time for setting up a mobile crane and so forth. Or gigantic concrete pours can also require long hours. If you are hearing noisy work outside of those hours, call. You'll either be told of a variance or they will contact the constructor. Take a video. [Source](http://www.seattle.gov/dpd/codesrules/codes/noise/)

I would add is that people do get sensitive about normal construction sounds. For example, if a large truck pulls up and stops prior to 7, sometimes people get upset. Nevermind the garbage trucks, Harley's and other noises, they focus on the construction truck because they have someone to complain to. Stand up for yourself, but don't be a pain in the ass just because you can. That's when everyone involved will dismiss your complaints as just a crank.

"Hi, This is Pramila Jayapal--great to see this on Reddit and to see it trending! Thanks for posting this. Some quick answers to great comments and questions below.
* The chart was showing where revenue comes from in the House Democrats proposal and the Senate Republicans proposal.  One of the things the Republican budget does is sweep a lot of one-time funds, local government funds, and the public works trust fund.  That's why it claims to raise no new taxes, but I think of it more as hidden taxes because those dollars would still have to be made up from somewhere and it certainly would not be a sustainable source of revenue beyond this budget.
* Capital gains tax would only apply to individuals who get $25K in capital gains or couples who get $50K in capital gains.  Remember this is gains from the sale of stocks and bonds, NOT income.  Based on analysis from Office of Financial Management, that would only affect 32,000 people across the state--or 4% of the total population who are the wealthiest.
* This is just the revenue side. The expense side is also important and I'm creating another table for it.  There are important areas that did not get restored--food stamps, TANF assistance, state need grants for higher ed, college bound scholarships, civil legal aid.
* It's meant to be simple, so people can start to understand where the money is coming from. The lines don't necessarily match up for any reason, as someone says below--but it's clearer to read than just a list.
* Sign up for my e-news, if you're interested in continuing to follow the state legislature on this and other issues. http://sdc.wastateleg.org/jayapal/

[/u/whosdamike: Has nonviolent protest lost its effectiveness in the US?](https://np.reddit.com/r/TrueAskReddit/comments/346irc/has_nonviolent_protest_lost_its_effectiveness_in/cqrwn8l)

&gt; Honestly, I think the idea that the US has a history of successful, completely non-violent protest is an idea manufactured and championed by the establishment. It's a convenient fantasy that encourages obedience, or at most *slightly inconvenient* disobedience.
&gt; 
&gt; [Al Jazeera](http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/11/26/american-social-movementshavealwaysincludedriots.html) covers it more eloquently than I ever could, but I'll toss in my additional/derived two cents anyway.
&gt; 
&gt; Many of the ""flashpoints"" in American human rights emerged in reaction to and coincident with violent protests, because that's when shit gets real. When people are being mildly inconvenienced, or when people are peacefully assembling, it's actually *very easy to ignore*.
&gt; 
&gt; We remember the era of MLK as an era of non-violent protest because that is the most convenient narrative for the establishment. It encourages very slow change with minimal disruption to the status quo.
&gt; 
&gt; But that's not the reality. Protests often turned ugly and violent, sometimes white ""counter-rioters"" would pop up and try to (or succeed in) razing black communities to the ground.
&gt; 
&gt; I think it's convenient to believe that the same progress would have been made even if the civil rights movement of the 50s/60s had been 100% non-violent. But I really think that, as ugly and horrible as violence is, it raises the stakes and accelerates things.
&gt; 
&gt; If a thousand protesters stand quietly in a candle vigil, then that's one thing.
&gt;

"http://www.pelleylawgroup.com/seattle-criminal-defenseblog/sb-5052-medical-marijuana-law-update

Here's a good rundown.

This has eliminated all home growing, and turned people who would prefer to grow at home a FELON.

Having Prop 215 &amp; Prop 420 experience in home / commercial grows this is appalling to anyone who has ever planted a seed.

A well taken care of cut of Chem-D for example will average 2.5OZ of primo.  

So you end up with 10OZ off 4 plants, and now bingo, you are a felon.  

My prescription in California that's still valid allows for 99 plants, and up to 8LBS.  That's legit freedom for a medical patient.

Now hear me out.

Say you have a 8x8 tent.  This will accomdate 42 plants comfortably.  

As your plants start off as seed or clone you have to allow for them to mature to veg state.  This can take at most 4 weeks (clone) to 8 weeks if it's from seed.  

So if you want to replace a 42 plant grow with 42 more when it finishes you would need the capacity to have 84.  But you also need to keep some moms around to sustain genetics, and maybe your friend got a sick cut of OG he traded you.  Now you have 91.  Whew that leaves a cozy 9 plants left to keep you clear.

42 plants * 2.5 oz.  = 105OZ.  105OZ / 16.  Is roughly 6.5LBS.  W00t I'm under the 8LB limit.  

But realistically that would be killing it EVERY TIME with genetics that never quit with no issues ever.  That's not practical.  

So a tent that size will average 4LBS of high grade mmj.  

From experience people with chrones, late stages of cancer, chronic pain, will go through a LB or more a month by turning it into edible form.  Which from a 42 plant perseptive puts you in line to consume 4LBS by the next grow is finished.

This is assuming you didn't lose the crop to theft, bugs, human or equip failure.  

If a medical patient where to go to a Seattle based rec shop and purchase 1LB of MMJ at REC prices they are looking at 10G or $2,800, that your insurance IS NOT allowed to cover.  And that's being hopeful at 10G.  Do the math at 20G.  In Cali 15G / 20G is still very real.  

You can make that at home for the price of water, turning the lights to grow it on, some simple salts,and the human factor of time / knowledge / love.  It's about 95% less money, and 500% more rewarding.

So now you are asking a medical patient to shell out this is real talk, $3,000 x 4.  Or $12,000 of real money per grow cycle to do what they could do for around $1000?  That is $36,000 a year in weed at these prices!!!!  

That's extorting the people who need it most, and forcing people who don't live near the city to have to travel great lengths.

"Hi /u/careless,

Thank you for speaking with the owners of Pinky’s on my behalf. I must say, I was disappointed that Pinky’s was involved with this situation as I have been a huge supporter of Pinky’s since it first opened across the street from its current location, and of Rancho Bravo Tacos since I moved to Seattle in 2008. Pinky’s is by far my favorite BBQ in Seattle (I have tried them all), which is why I did not think twice to place a large order from them when I saw that they could now be delivered from through Postmates.

As I do still support Pinky’s as a great, local small business, please thank the management for their offer to refund my full order costs, but that is not necessary. I understand that they simply charged Postmates based on the significant updated pricing of the menu items I chose (the gratuity on delivery is still a bit puzzling however), and then Postmates passed on those charges to me even though Postmates lists the items as costing significantly less. That said, I do feel that Pinky’s should have a duty to understand the experience that their customers will be going through when Pinky’s decides to partner with Postmates or any other delivery service. All I can ask is that the management of Pinky’s does their best to keep pricing transparent with their customers, and consider discontinuing relationships with third-party services when there is a high likelihood that customers like myself will have a negative experience. If Pinky’s has the means to update their prices on Postmates or temporarily disable delivery service, they ought to do so as soon as reasonably possible.

Overall, this post was intended to draw attention to the deceitful billing tactics and poor customer service of Postmates, which is pushing to increase its presence in Seattle and Portland by offering free delivery credits to customers. I personally will never use Postmates again, as I don’t want to ever have to guess if I’ll be charged the stated price of goods and service, or if I’ll be charged 140% of that.

Thanks again!",false,false,t1_cq3p9yi,antau,Maple Leaf,0,1428374661,t5_2qhad,t3_31oq23,t1_cq3nysq,45,1432238965,0,0,cq3p9yi,Seattle,45,,flair

"Ok, this is something I happen to know quite a bit about. First, you may want to register with Connections, which is part of DESC at 3rd and James. They are not only a day shelter, but they assign you a case manager who helps with personal issues and employment guidance. They offer a computer lab, serve breakfast &amp; lunch, and have laundry services and showers. [Bread of Life Mission](http://www.breadoflifemission.org/) in the Pioneer Square area also offers day shelter services, serves coffee and donated pastries from Starbucks, and serves lunch. Seattle's Outdoor Meal Program serves hot breakfast, lunch, and dinner in the commuter parking lot at 7th and Cherry- [here is the feed schedule](http://www.oslserves.org/outdoormealsite.php). The [Northwest Harvest Food Bank](http://www.northwestharvest.org/) is between 8th and 9th on Cherry St., and they offer sack lunches and and other take-with food/canned goods/produce on Mon, Wed, Fri til 5PM. St. James Cathedral on 9th serves hot dinner Mon-Fri at 4:15. The church at E. Republican St. and Broadway on Capitol Hill (across from QFC) serves dinner at 5PM Wed and Thu, and have clothing donations, take-away sandwiches and other food. The Church across from Cal Anderson park on 12th (I think) serves lunch on Tue and Thu at noon I believe. Church groups and Food not Bombs serve huge lunches every Saturday in Occidental and City Hall Parks.

[SHARE/WHEEL](http://www.sharewheel.org/) runs a network of self-governing shelters across Seattle, as well as the tent cities. They screen people in Mon, Wed, Fri at 1PM, and Tue, Thu, and Sat at 6PM. Show up not a second sooner than those times at the doorway in the alley behind Bergman's Luggage on Stewart St. Between 2nd and 3rd in the back basement of the [Josephinium building](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Josephinum/@47.611228,-122.340412,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0xc3a0d9d3ff7da7fb?sa=X&amp;ei=sQQ3Va9Li7LIBKXkgbgJ&amp;ved=0CHkQ_BIwCw). They also offer a locker service for you to store belongings. They are by far the best and safest shelters in Seattle. You can, however, find shelter through [Operation Nightwatch](http://www.seattlenightwatch.org/). You must get a referral from either DESC or Bread of Life Mission, and you show up at their facility each night at 9PM, are served dinner, and then dispatched to a local shelter via bus (ticket is provided).

If you are between jobs, I highly recommend considering selling [Real Change Newspaper](http://realchangenews.org/). It is an award winning, professionally written weekly newspaper that focuses on Seattle social equality, affordable housing for the low income, LGBTQ culture/issues, and is rightly respected as the honest alternative to panhandling, as the vendors purchase each copy for sixty cents apiece and resell them for two dollars, keeping the profits. Many times, vendors receive between $5-$20 per copy from generous customers.

If you need any further guidance, or would like a referral to Real Change, which will earn you free papers to sell, feel free to PM me. Best of luck to you and stay safe!

"[This](http://www.psmag.com/business-economics/in-defense-of-rent-control) is an interesting read for those who  believe you (or don't).

Some interesting excerpts:

&gt; ""a comprehensive review of literature by New York housing lawyer Timothy Collins found that the received wisdom regarding rent regulations is overly simplistic—partially because hard ceilings on rents are often imagined, while the reality is more often (as in New York’s case) a more measured approach meant to discourage landlords from dramatically raising rents and displacing tenants.""

&gt; ""New York’s two largest building booms took place during times of strict rent controls: the 1920s and the post-war period between 1947 and 1965. (He is not arguing that the regulations provoked the building, just that they didn’t restrain it in the same way strict zoning codes did in the mid-1960s.)""
 


&gt; ""Outside the city, one economist found that housing construction in New Jersey fell by 52 percent in cities that enacted rent control regulations in the early 1970s—but fell 88 percent in those that didn’t.""
 


&gt; ""In 1994, real estate interests in Massachusetts organized a statewide referendum to end rent control—which only existed in Boston, Cambridge, and Brookline—and just barely won. But Census data shows that Boston’s vacancy rate was four percent before the regulations were phased out and 2.9 percent four years after they were done away with—scrapping rent control had, at the very least, not generated a measurable effect on apartment availability. The median price for a two-bedroom apartment doubled in the meantime.""
 


&gt; ""An Economist article on the end of rent control in Cambridge reported that 40 percent of covered tenants moved out of their apartments after the end of rent regulations in the city—rents had increased by 50 percent—and reports of evictions rose by a third. A 2012 study seems to show that the removal of rent regulations did nothing to lower housing prices and ended Cambridge’s tenure as a mixed-income neighborhood.""

"I don't think usmauriga was defending the dealers. In fact, it looks like their suggestion was meant to stop the drug dealers by providing legal, regulated access to the substances that keep those people in business. 

As many metropolitan areas have seen, crackdowns on drug/gang crime based around physical locations has a tendency to simply push the problems elsewhere within the city or to its outskirts. 

If drugs being illegal stopped people from using &amp; selling them we wouldn't have a problem with that anymore because the laws would have worked. Obviously regulated sales of hard drugs is a step further than Portugal, but decriminalizing drug use/possession still strikes most people as a backwards idea when it comes to reducing usage, and yet it works. 

It's certainly not a switch to flip (legalize/regulate the drug market &amp; all problems are solved, yay!), but it does look like a step in the right direction to me. Portugal still forces its users into shady situations with shady people who know the law is breathing down their necks. If Portugal's users could purchase safe products from safe stores why would anyone go to the dealers? Couple that with realistic education that emphasizes responsible use (because drug usage is older than humanity I don't think it's worthwhile to preach total sobriety for all) &amp; harm reduction &amp; maybe, just maybe, we can actually help the users, along with the rest of our community. 

Is it guaranteed? Nope. Could it backfire? Totally.

This shows the bias that the news ends up helping to perpetuate.  The past 2 May Day events have seen many thousands of people peacefully rallying.

Once night starts to come around and these people have made their way home, a second much smaller crowd emerges.  Mostly juveniles from lower income areas who want to incite something.  Last year seemed to go well overall, with the police and their ""soft"" approach seeing much success.

Yet they have the worst traffic congestion on earth. L.A. is 8th densest in this country and #1 for traffic. That's because of bad urban design, and in general a lack of options outside of driving.

"Los Angeles ex-pat checking in.  While I appreciate your valiant suggestions and can-do attitude, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to let you down gently:

*You do not understand the magnitude of the task ahead of you.*

I was in a motorcycle accident in October.  A livery driver attempted to transition from the 405 carpool lane (which is illegal) to the 10 East.  He did not check his mirrors nor did he signal, which meant he crossed right in front of me.  As a consequence, I was knocked across **four** northbound lanes; the motorcycle across **five.**  Fortunately he and I were the only ones going over 15mph (I was the only one going over 20) so it didn't even appreciably slow traffic when someone got out and helped me move my motorcycle to the other side of the road... *across the remaining two lanes.*

It was 3 in the afternoon.

I used to think I had it rough, commuting from Lynnwood to Redmond every day.  I grossly underestimated the potential [magnitude of the problem](http://i.imgur.com/22JJNOs.jpg) and the [fuckery WSDOT was *not* guilty of](http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_eye/2015/02/11/guerrilla_public_service_on_99_invisible_richard_ankrom_replaced_a_los_angeles.html).  I-405 and 167 south is a bad interchange, yeah... but in order to get from the 101 South to the 110 South (in other words, to continue south through downtown LA) one must grab the far right lane.  Then within a half mile, the far left lane.  Except the lane that you end up in?  Because you can't quite cross five lanes of traffic in a half mile?  That'll get you there, too, even though it's labeled as the 6th street exit.  Oh, and you'll merge with stopped traffic around a 15mph onramp.  And then the two lanes on the left will exit into downtown.  But now you want to get over or else you're on the 10 West.  And now there's nowhere to turn around for three exits so 7 southbound lanes of the 405 it is.  

So keep dreaming, little visionary.  It's good to have a goal.  But I honestly think the Convention Center would have to physically collapse onto I-5 in order to bring Seattle to the top.  LA traffic is a whole nuther thing.

"Transportation researcher chiming in here

I'm always very concerned about this type of ""research"". TomTom is a business, and they clearly have a vested interest in consumers buying their product. Sadly this also means they have a vested interest in overstating congestion levels so consumers will buy TomTom equipment to help them avoid congestion.

For example, their definition of congestion is observed peak hour flows versus observed free-flow speeds. Observed free-flow is typically significantly higher than the speed limit on a road, but is it really problematic if people are driving at the speed limit during rush hour? According to TomTom that is congestion. A lot of this ""congestion"" is simply people that can't go speeding in rush hour.

I'm not saying that accounts for all the congestion they report and clearly there is legitimate congestion in Seattle. However, it clearly inflates the figures and its difficult to tell if cities are affected by this equally or if controlling for it would switch the ranking around completely. It also doesn't capture the mobility of people that aren't driving cars, so a city could theoretically have the worst congestion score in this study but still have the best transportation system. Go to London, Copenhagen or Amsterdam Thursday afternoon and car traffic will be completely stuck... but its still obvious to everyone that their transportation systems are much more efficient than Seattle's since the majority of people are not commuting by car anyway.

I won't argue too much for or against any specific solution or state of affairs in Seattle, but while this data is interesting the ranking is pretty meaningless for anything but consumers wanting to see when and where they can avoid the worst congestion. Seattle is congested because every large city is congested, which is just a simple fact of spatial geography. The best solution is to make significant upgrades to the regions poor transit service (by international standards), which will probably only make Seattle look worse in TomTom's studies.

tl,dr: Major cities are congested all over the world because there isn't enough space for people to drive. There is no long-term solution that doesn't involve people moving out of their cars. Building roads to solve the problem just makes it worse because people move further away from their jobs (LA is a good example).

The Art Institutes, and Education Management Corporation, their parent company, have been in all kinds of hot water in the past few years.  *Frontline* did an investigative piece on them in 2011, called [Educating Sergeant Pantzke](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/educating-sergeant-pantzke/), that raked them over the coals for aggressively recruiting veterans and then not delivering the education and services they (and we) were paying for with their G.I. benefits.  They've been sued by former students, shareholders, several states, and the U.S. Justice Department.  Some of the suits allege that they paid their admissions people by commission, based on the number of students they enrolled (which is against the rules for schools where students get federal financial aid, because it creates a massive conflict of interest); and that they enrolled unqualified students who weren't able to finish their degrees, or to advance their careers like they were told they could, even if they did graduate (sources:  [(1)](http://nyti.ms/19koMUQ); [(2)](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/davidhalperin/whistleblower-lawsuit-ver_b_4830533.html); [(3)](http://www.wtae.com/investigations/Whistle-blower-accuses-EDMC-of-falsifying-records-to-get-taxpayer-money/18535232); [(4)](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/15/education-management-corp-for-profit-college_n_1349063.html)).

Would you do the same if other restaurants adopted a policy like this? Everyone is seeing this through the eyes of the consumer and not the business owner. There are going to be long term effects that we can't even think of right now that will stem from this. The fact is that the legislation was rushed and there is not enough information on what a 50% minimum wage increase will do to a city's economy. I just don't think it bodes well for small businesses when a lot of minimum wage jobs are paid that amount because the workload calls for that amount. A person that mops floors or answers phone calls for a living deserves to be paid nearly what a teacher or a firefighter makes in a year?

The loudest is that DC-9 (the one with the stairs down). 

If you look on flightaware.com you'll see the schedules. 

http://flightaware.com/live/airport/KBFI

The cargo UPS, DHL, and ATI planes get there at 5 am then leave at 6 am, and also at 6 pm leaving around 7pm. There are between 1-3 each time, more in the evening, and it seems seasonal. There's usually one more 727 that leaves at 2:30 am some days that goes to Fort Worth Alliance airport.

The rest are small prop planes and some business jets.

The fighter jet one (Northrop F-5) in the pictures is Paul Allen (look at the tail # N586PC, lol).

"I love that people keep referencing ""studies"" that supposedly show strong benefits to raising the speed limit. The problem is they never provide links, and I can't seem to find them. Admittedly, my Google-fu may be weak, but to quote what I did find from the NHTSA:

&gt; The overwhelming majority of evidence suggests that reductions in speed limits reduce vehicle speeds and crashes; increases in speed limits increase speed, as well as crashes. [(Source)](http://www.nhtsa.gov/people/injury/enforce/Speed_Forum_Presentations/Ferguson.pdf)

A great example of that is a study published by the Federal Highway Administration and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in the late 1990s after Congress fully repealed the National Maximum Speed Laws. The summary is a bit wordy, but in short states that increased their speed limits saw a significant increase in road fatalities:
&gt; In the absence of detailed information regarding where and when speed limits were raised, it was possible to employ simple statistical models to analyze the fatality experience in these groups of states during 1996 compared to expectations based on historical trends. With a linear regression model1 for each of the three groups of states using data for 1991-1996 which accounted for a time trend and an intervention for the post-NMSL time period, it was found that Interstate fatalities experienced a statistically significant increase in those states that raised their posted speed limits late in 1995 or early in 1996. The effect found in the group of states that increased speeds later in 1996 was numerically consistent with the “early change” states, but failed to reach statistical significance, while there was essentially no change in fatalities on Interstates for states that did not raise their speed limits during 1995-1996.

&gt;Based upon the analyses conducted in this study on the first year of experience with higher speed limits, it is estimated that Interstate fatalities in the states that increased speed limits experienced approximately 350 more fatalities than would have been expected based on historical trends, about 9 percent above expectations. 
Based on economic cost models used by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the total economic cost of 350 additional fatalities and associated injuries and crashes is more than $820 million in 1996 dollars. [(Source)](http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/Pubs/808-637.PDF)

So, frankly, the evidence that higher speed limits are somehow safer is lacking, at best. Wishful thinking, even. 

Certainly, having more uniform speeds on highways improves safety since it reduces the differential speeds during impact - but even if two cars hitting each other only have a differential speed of a few MPH, the safety barrier they eventually hit will be going 0 MPH. If you hit that barrier going 75 (or 80, or 90), you're chances of survival are going to be far less than they would be if you hit it at 60 or 70. Likewise, at those higher speeds, you'll have less time to respond to emergencies at-speed or take defensive actions - further increasing the likelihood of a crash.

There is also the reality that higher speed limits can encourage more sprawl like development, since you can drive farther in the same amount of time, which is [well known to cause obesity and other negative public health effects.](http://www.cdc.gov/healthyplaces/articles/Urban_Sprawl_and_Public_Health_PHR.pdf) So, while calling for more study is an easy political way to kill something without saying as much, I can't blame the Governor for having reservations.

"So, just to start, I'll detail my qualifications: regular bike commuter for about 17 years in 7 different cities on 3 continents; bike messenger for a year in Seattle back when there were zero bike lanes and basically zero bike commuters; bike messenger for 6 months in Boston; quasi-semi-pro cyclist (I raced for a few years, let's say); rider of alleycat races in places all over the world. I did all these things and I didn't die and that's not because I'm some genius or superhuman or anything like that it's because I learned and then followed these rules.

1) Think like a cyclist

You're not a car. Really. You're not. Don't try to act like one because you're not one.  What you are is a quail egg in a world of hammers where everything will break you without even noticing it. Unless somebody leaves a baby stroller out in traffic you are always the slowest, weakest, least protected on the road. I see a lot of cyclists say: I'm on the road with cars therefore I'm a car. That is a mistake. When you see a big line of cars waiting to do something that you're not going to do like get onto a highway onramp, don't sit in the middle of them. Cars have bumpers. You do not. Go around them. You're safer not around them. Should you go up and past a big line of cars waiting for a light at an intersection? This is a contingent answer based on a few things but I'm gonna say that most of the time the answer is yes because, again, you're not a car, you don't want to be in between cars at a stoplight. Go around them on the right side and position yourself where the first car in the line can see you. Is that annoying for drivers? Maybe but it shouldn't be. They'll pass you and you'll be fine. By passing them as they wait, they know that you're there so that when they pass you they now know that you're there and that means they're less likely to kill you. You want cars to see you *a lot*. Like as much as possible. You do not however want to pretend to be a car because that's going to get you hurt.

The safest thing you can do is ride with another cyclist. They don't have to be your friend, you don't even have to talk to them but you do want to be around them because the two of you together are way more visible than you alone. Where there are other bikes there is safety and where there's safety you might not get dead.

2) Always Be Looking

When you're riding on the road guess what you're surrounded by a lot? Glass. Guess what glass is? Reflective. That car parked to your right has a side mirror on it and that side mirror can tell you lots of stuff. That car driving to your left has a side mirror, a rear window, shiny sides, a lot of stuff that gives you imperfect but vital information. Use it. Use them. You want to build a mental model of what's going on around you at all times. You want to update that mental model as many times a second as possible. Keep that head on a swivel, always be looking around, always be using anything possible that can tell you what's outside of your field of view. 


3) Always Be Listening

Never Wear Headphones. Never. Ever. Most of the time you can't see behind you but most of the time you can hear behind you and around you and that can keep you from getting dead. Listen. Seriously be listening all the time. Study what a car sounds like as it approaches, study how fast engines sound, study what different kinds of tires sound like because in a town with lots of electric and hybrid cars if you can't hear tires, you're gonna be in trouble.

4) Ride Assertively

Not aggressively but assertively. This is a fine line and I like to say the secret is make what you want to do evident, begin to firmly do it, and then continue to do it. You want to go left. So tell *everyone* that you're going to go left, look that direction and make sure the coast is clear, and then start going left. Hand signals are a great way to be assertive. ""Hey, this is what I'm doing."" When people don't know what you're going to do, they don't know what to do around you and that's bad for everyone. When they know what you're going to do and just decide they don't give a shit, you're at least aware of that. Angry pickup truck guy veering around you and telling you to get off the road is going to make a lot of noise that will keep you from getting dead.

5) Stay out of cars blindspots

Pretty simple: stay seen.

6) Signal Where You're Going

You may think handsignals are lame but they are not. I started using them when I lived in Denmark and I have now embraced them fully for a few reasons: they make you bigger and bigger is easier to see and easier to see is less likely to die. They tell people what you're going to do so if they do see you, then they know what you're going to do, and that's part of being a good citizen.

7) Drivers and cars aren't your enemies

Most of them probably like you. Those that don’t, don’t worry about them.

8) Cabs are kinda your enemies

You never know what a cab is going to do, ever. Never assume you do because you don't. They might whip across 4 lanes of traffic without signalling. He might suddenly brake. He might suddenly have all of his doors open at once. Cabs are the worst thing on the road and you should treat them thusly. 

9) Never wear anything to obstructs your sight.

I love big hooded things because I love not getting totally soaked on a rainy day but a hood that blocks your ability to look around you or behind you is bad. Don’t wear anything that blocks your peripheral vision or makes it hard for you to see behind you.

10) You’re gonna get doored

This is where you're riding in the bike lane like a good citizen and someone in their parked car opens their drivers door into you and you go flying. Happens a lot. I can think of about 9 times it's happened to me and I'm sure I'm missing a bunch of them. Part of avoiding this is in always looking. You have to look at the headrests and side mirrors of EVERY CAR you pass. When you see that head turn, when you see those eyes look into the rear or side mirror, slow down and get ready to go left because otherwise you're going to get tossed into traffic and that is bad.

10) If you think about all the ways that you and a car can make contact then you’ll have an idea of what to watch out for and how to prepare for it. Here’s some of my favorites

a) Right Hook

We all ride in the bike zone on the side of the lane most of the time and that means that we're really susceptible to having a car swing right in front of us. That car ahead of you is slowing down as they come to an intersection, is it because they're going to pull over (into you), take a right turn and cause you to T-Bone them, because they're lost? Whatever they do, if you hit them it's going to a scratch on their paint and probably a hospital trip for you. People in Seattle don’t use turn signals too much. Watch their speed and watch where they’re looking and don’t try to pass someone on the right if it looks like they might be about to go right. Look behind you, go left and around them. Use a headlight or front light. If you're behind someone going slow vehicle ride behind them, not in their blind spot.

b) The Left Cross 

A car coming towards you makes a left turn right in front of you, or right into you. If someone stops or slows down a lot in the middle of an intersection it’s because they’re about to do something. Be aware of what they’re about to do because very often their turn signal or more importantly lack thereof isn’t going to do you much good.

c) The Mow Down

You’re just going little to the left to go around a parked car or like a classic giant Seattle pothole in the road and you get nailed by a car coming up from behind :( Look behind you and listen behind you. Always. Head on a swivel. All alert. Don’t dip in and out of traffic, ride a straight line. Also: use a rear light. IMHO a rear light is more important than a front light because you can generally see what’s in front of you, whereas is is much more difficult to see what is behind you.

12) Be Visible

Wear lights, wear a bright colored backpack, wear bright colored helmets, clothes.

13) Falling

At some point you're going to fall. I've fallen probably hundreds of times and I've gotten, I don't want to say ""good"" but ""better"" at it. First and most important rule: if you fall in traffic GET OUT OF TRAFFIC DON'T JUST LAY THERE. Especially if you're alone, you can figure out if you broke anything later because your number of broken bones is going to go up by a lot if you get actually run over. There is an art to falling and one of the best pieces of advice I've ever gotten is: ""keep your elbows in"". You're not going to catch yourself, you're going to break your hand or your arm or both. Don’t flail, you’re not a bird and you don’t have wings, nothing you do with your arms is going to help you unless you’re going 2mph except using them to cushion your landing. I find the best landing to be basically a boxing defensive stance but that’s just me and your mileage may vary.

14) Be VERY careful on grates

You want to hit a giant cheese-grater at 20 mph? Brake, turn, shift your weight, really do anything on these other than go straight ahead at a steady pace. Your best possible outcome crashing on these involves buckets of blood. Avoid them if at all possible.

15) Watch for pedestrians

That guy standing and weaving at the corner of Pine and 3rd *is* going to walk right out in front of you and you're both going to get hurt. Drunk kids in Fremont, U-District, Cap Hill, Pio-square, they're all going to walk out right in front of you and it's going to be lame for everyone. 

16) Get good tires

Slick streets are hard to stop on and despite what your intuition might tell you, off-road tires aren’t good for stopping on slick streets. You want road tires. You also want road tires that can take some glass and other street-candy without flatting. I recommend Continental Gatorskins.",false,false,t1_cq12ras,97227ist,Vashon Island,0,1428166811,t5_2qhad,t3_31fh00,t3_31fh00,46,1432193581,0,1,cq12ras,Seattle,46,,flair

"How about the west coast of Vancouver Island?  It's so close to Seattle, but so few people down here seem aware of what a great place it is to visit.

I spent a few days in Ucluelet, the less-developed, less-touristy sibling to Tofino.  Both towns are lovely, and the stretch of coast between them (including the [Pacific Rim National Park Reserve](http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/pn-np/bc/pacificrim/index.aspx)) is absolutely beautiful.  There's a long, gorgeous, sandy beach that's really popular for surfing.  There are [boats](http://www.hellobc.com/ucluelet/things-to-do/water-activities/cruises-boat-tours.aspx) that can take you out on a whale- or wildlife-watching cruise, or drop you somewhere remote as a jumping-off point for hiking or kayaking on your own.  Personally, I could just sit on the beach and watch the waves for hours.

Tofino, especially, gets busy in the summer, but it's all relative--the crowds don't come close to Ocean Shores or Cannon Beach.  And in the off-season, the visitors mostly go home, and leave the spectacular storm-watching to the locals.

There are a few [small, local airlines](http://www.tofinoairport.com/carriers.php) that serve Tofino, and a [bus](http://www.tofinobus.com/) from Victoria and Vancouver.  Otherwise, unless you have a boat capable of open-ocean travel, driving is the only way to get to the west coast of Vancouver Island. There's one road into this area, Canada Hwy 4, through Port Alberni and over Sutton Pass.  It's a narrow road, a little steep and winding in places, but spectacular.  It's do-able in a day from Seattle.  You can't drive far up and down the coast from there--it's too rugged--and the BC ferries don't go on the outside of Vancouver Island.  There are other areas over there I'd like to explore--[Nootka Sound](http://www.getwest.ca/), or the [Pacific Marine Circle Route](http://www.seattlepi.com/travel/article/Going-coastal-Vancouver-Island-s-vivid-6050304.php) out of Victoria--but because of that can't-get-there-from-here thing, they're probably going to have to be separate trips.

"[After reading the bill](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2015-16/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Passed%20Legislature/5052-S2.PL.pdf), it's pretty clear that SB 5052 is not intended to *gut the medical canabis law* but rather reform it since it's original inception in 1998 when marijuna access was limited and the state looked the other way in spite of federal law. Now that I-502 passed, SB 5052 is just cleaning up the previous laws in order to consolidate medical and recreational uses.

**Edit:** Sec 8 of this bill allows growers to grow more plants as long as the THC/CBD is appropriate for MMJ.

**Edit2:** Sec 11 allows retailers to provide MMJ with THC &lt;0.3 for free to patients

Sec 12 allows underage patients (18-20) to go into stores, patients under the age of 18 require an adult (18+) to purchase for them. 

**Edit3:** Section 18 makes it harder to get your ""green"" card. Medical practitioners must perform ""in-person"" physicals before issuing licenses.

"Urghhh this was painful to read. I *want* to support the artists perspectives but their comments felt naive and just feed the drama machine rather than proposing any real positive alternatives. The tech/development people had some cringe-worthy snippets, but at least they're trying to think positively and constructively.

&gt; JC: Construction moratorium on Capitol Hill starting today. No more building permits. No more liquor licenses on Capitol Hill. Period. Thoes are the two things I would push [Mayor] Murray for. Like, stop. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. Stop tearing everything down!

Yeah, sure, that's a real helpful plan. You can't just stop development when the city's population is growing by the thousands every year in the midst of an economic boom. That's a sure-fire way of just making the affordability crisis even worse.

Yes there are absolutely problems that are not being adequately addressed by planners and developers. The development process needs to be guided to be beneficial to a multitude of groups, and ""Stop, just stop it all"" doesn't do anyone any favors or solve any problems. By being an obstinate ass no one in charge of the decision-making process is going to listen to you; you're just eliminating yourself from the conversation.

&gt; JC: I feel like they’re probably pretty flapped out. They all work 80 hours a week, and the last thing they’re going to do is go to a gallery, unless they have a date to go on.

Wow, generalizations and hyperbole much? Many tech people are supporters/patrons of the arts, or are even artists, musicians, or performers themselves. Many tech jobs are highly flexible and don't demand anywhere near 80 hours per week, and are specifically sought after *because* they allow for people to have a life outside of work with interests and hobbies, and disposable income to indulge in them. But unless they're pained, starving artists then it must not be real art.

&gt; JC: Money feeds art in a way, so we’re hearing all about money. But it’s “new money,” from people who, instead of renting their $4,000 apartment and then buying a $10,000 piece of art, going to the ballet, gallery openings, and being a sophisticated, cosmopolitan part of the city’s culture, they’re interested in seeing “how many Star Wars toys can I buy?” It’s like, “Oh my God! You should actually own a work of art! It makes you a whole person. It makes you real and not just a facade of money.” Up in the Sunset Electric [a new luxury apartment building on Capitol Hill] there are apartments that have empty liquor bottles on the windowsill like dorm rooms.

Boo hoo, some people aren't spending their money on the things I think they should spend their money on. People are only ""whole people"" if they do what I think they should do.

(For the record, I do think lining your luxury apartment window sill with empty liquor bottles is pretty tacky, but I also don't expect everyone to buy $10,000 pieces of art if that's not their thing. Also, more expensive art != better art.)

&gt; RL: Do we need some arts education for techies?

&gt; JC: Obviously.

They're going to need a better arts ambassador than this guy, then.

&gt; Petersen: Capitol Hill, from basically grunge onwards, became this creative place. When I first moved here nine years ago it was a very creative, inclusive, exciting art scene. 

LOL, classic ""it was cool when I moved here, I totally didn't change the scene, but fuck those new guys"". People have been saying ""Man Capitol Hill sucks now compared to 5 years ago"" for 30 years.

&gt; SL: The thing about this isolation and exclusionism—that totally doesn’t exist in the tech world. They’ve embraced my questions like nobody’s business. I kind of wish the Seattle art scene took this approach, where it’s like, “You’re new here! Let me introduce you to so-and-so because it’s important for us to all thrive.” What’s funny is, I think we are surrounded by people in both the art and tech world. And it seems like some of the misunderstanding comes from the fact that you have to choose. If you are a developer at Amazon, you aren’t allowed to be creative. And if you’re creative, you’re not allowed to have a “job.”

&gt;CP: Exactly.

&gt; SL: That seems toxic. I’m more interested in where the commonalities are; that’s where things can thrive. I just get tired of the people complaining who don’t do anything. It’s just “rabble rabble rabble.” I’m just like, do something about this, and that’s kind of what you were trying to do.

&gt; CP: I’ve got a willingness to do a lot of things. It’s just like...

&gt; SL: What do you need to keep you here in Seattle? From moving to L.A.?

&gt; CP: Um . . . I guess a lot of it has to do with people not relating to the things I’m into in terms of art.

&gt; SL: One of my developers upstairs was saying he wanted to talk to you because he likes your work! I think you just have to make those conversations more available so these things can happen. In the digital space you have no excuse.

&gt; SL: That’s actually a tech-startup mentality. We go through that thought process literally every day. The art and tech scene, I feel like there are so many more commonalities than differences. It’s a tragedy the two worlds are so separate. What would heal this divide are more people who are bridges.

This is a great point, the whole ""us vs. them"" mentality is incredibly toxic. Having to choose between art and tech is completely false dichotomy.

On some of our engines we had rubber LDH ( large diameter hose) 5 inch hoses. It doesn't seem big, but a regular attack line is usually 1.5 to 1.75 inches, and you have to have a team of big dudes ( all inclusive non-gender specific ""dudes"") to handle a 2.5 inch line. In a 5 inch line one linear foot is about 1 gallon of water. The rubber Supply line isn't as durable as the textile synthetic jacket hoses mentioned above. We advised a state trooper that he needed to wait for a minute for us to turn off the source of this 5 inch hose before he could drive over it for a call or something. He chose not to listen and when he drove over it the exhaust pipe right under the engine burned a hole in the hose, releasing 120 psi water into the engine compartment and completely flooding his car, inside and out. It was a spectacularly dickish move, and we weren't super motivated to help him for a time. The car was towed away dead.

"So, what about housing supply? 

Rent control seems to be a reactive, populist policy that has little immediate impact except for stability for existing renters at the cost of future renters, and can be a disincentive to new policy. Demand is outstripping supply, and locking existing rents just means new rents will rise that much faster all else being equal. I suppose that's politically valuable since existing renters are existing voters and new renters aren't here yet, but it doesn't seem to actually cut to the heart of the problem.

So it would seem that the problem is housing supply. Seattle needs many more high rise apartments and rezoning more favorable to density, but far too many NIMBY's don't want high rises in their neighborhood or paradoxically blame developers for rising rents. Rent control at it's best isn't a large disincentive for development, but I can see how an investor would look at a rent controlled property and consider other investments safer. Seattle should look to push developers to compete in production to irrational lengths until the bubble pops and rents collapse from over supply.

"First, proper notice requires that one copy is mailed to you, another is posted on your door and the landlord has the final copy.  If he cannot produce the physical notice with a date, it doesn't count as proper service of a notice.

Second, you must be a out of your lease for a rent change (i.e. in month-to-month).  

Third, you are required to be given 30 days notice, or 60 days if the increase was more than 10%.  



If these conditions were met, your rent increase is valid.  An e-mail doesn't count; your landlord needs to show you a physical, dated copy of the increase.

See our [Sample Letter: Improper Rent Increase or Rule Change.](http://www.tenantsunion.org/pdf/Sample_Letter_Rent_Increase_or_Rule_Change.pdf) However, a rent increase without proper notice may not be adequate defense against an eviction. Tenants who are not given proper notice may still decide to pay the rent increase (if they are able to) in order to avoid the possibility that the landlord files an eviction against them. If your landlord does not acknowledge their legal obligations to provide proper notice and instead serves you a 3-day pay or vacate notice, a tenant can pay the rent increase by writing “payment under protest” on their check.

"Okay, for the stupid people in this city, who can't seem to understand what Sex workers are, let me help you out.

A Bikini is NOT the outfit a Sex Worker wears.   Never has been, never will be.    Sex workers wear dresses &amp; sex normal clothes when they are working the streets as prostitutes.   They do NOT wear bikinis.    Stippers do NOT wear bikinis, they were costumes &amp; underwear.   Fancy underwear, not the type you going swimming in.   If you do NOT believe me, then go to a strip club, you will see.

Also, if a chick in a bikini is serving you coffee and is NOT giving you a happy ending, then you are just buying coffee.   For a Sex Worker to be consider a ""Sex Worker"" they need to preform some act of ""Sex"" on you, or with you.   Ladies serving coffee in bikini are NOT preforming any act of Sex on you, not matter how perverted you are.

If the ladies want to dress in Bikinis to serve us coffee, we should be all for it.

"This is a great video for visualizing the different alignment options. 

Having spent most of my life living, working and going to school in the areas that this extension would serve I think the full SR-99 alignment is the clear winner. In the area between S 200th St and S260th St the main transit destination is Highline CC. The I-5 alignment either puts riders a quarter of a mile away or makes a costly and timing consuming detour to get closer. Further SR-99 is the main corridor for commerce and residence in the area. 


I-5 gives better access to the Star Lake and 320th St park and rides. However with the 99 alignment it looks to me like the TC terminus leaves open the possibility of stopping at the 320th P&amp;R as the line eventually continues further south and with the 99 alignment you get the Redondo Heights P&amp;R.

"Ask people from other parts, and you'll see answers like you have seen so far: isolated, traffic on the bridge, no fun.  Ask actual residents of West Seattle and you'll get a different answer altogether.

I fucking love it out here. We have all the benefits of having the big city right there, but with the feel of living in a college town. West Seattle itself, especially around Alaska Junction, reminds me of the feel of my time in Fayetteville, Arkansas or Lawrence, Kansas.  A nice drag with local businesses fulfilling our every need. Add on top of that the availability of Alki Beach to walk along the sand, Schmitz Park to walk through the forest, Lincoln Park and its beauty and awesome swimming pool, it's all fantastic.

Getting across the bridge can be a little tricky at times, especially if you're driving, but you shouldn't be doing that during rush hour anyways from here. It's plenty well served by buses that can breeze by bridge traffic in dedicated lanes, or you can avoid it altogether by taking the water taxi across the bay.

We do have a car, but we've only put 2500 miles on it the last six months (mostly via trips to Ikea our the state fair), so we live comfortably without depending on our car.

One thing you should be aware of is that traffic will get worse before it gets better. Once the viaduct shuts down, things will be weird until the tunnel opens, and even then, it will be hard to predict. The light rail has some plans to come this direction, but it depends on the ST3 package currently being debated in Olympia, and even then, it wouldn't be completed until, what, 2022?

Obviously, I'm biased, but I think the pros far outweigh the cons. We looked in the Green Lake area and Fremont and Wallingford, just like everyone else.

"Hello, tohko. I am an Amateur Radio operator in Seattle. Please take the enforcement letter that your relatives received from the FCC seriously. The FCC takes these matters very seriously. They first and foremost want the interference issue resolved. However is nothing is done their could be forced to issue fine but that is usually only done as a last resort method of motivation.

The FCC doesn't issue these letter solely on the word of an Amateur Radio operator or anyone else. Before they issued this letter they had verified that the source of the radio emission was in fact your relatives house. They have sophisticated radio direction finding equipment that removes all doubt as to the source home.

I notice that the letter sites Section 15.5(b) ""Operation of an intentional, unintentional, or incidental radiator"". In layman terms this means that they suspect that your relatives are not intentionally interfering with licensed radio communications but rather there is some device in your relatives house that is operation outside of it's original design and unintentionally causing interference.

As you can see the last line makes it very clear that the FCC wants your relatives to take action to solve this problem. The FCC is usually very reasonable and long as your relatives are making a good faith effort to locate and eliminate the source of the interference they have don't have to fear being fined.

Here are some thing for them to try:

* They can call the FCC and ask for help in tracking down the source of the interference.

* If they know someone who is an amateur radio operator they could ask them for help. Most amateur radio operators like to help out. A large number of amateur radio operators got their license in order to be a service to their community.

* They can try tracking down the interference themselves. Since the signal that being sent out by the device is so broad 1.6MHz to 30MHz they might be able to hear it on an portable AM radio which receives approx. from .5MHz to 1.5MHz or they can buy/borrow a portable shortwave radio receiver that tunes to 1.6MHz thru 30MHz. Then tune around until they find the signal. Then go around unplugging things in the house until they find the thing that when unplugged causes the interference to go away.

* They can contact a local amateur radio club for help. Remember that these people are hobbyist and are not required to help your relatives but will usually be happy to help because they like to help. You can send an email to the club at info@mikeandkey.org

"I think this is the most important thing to take away from the article:

&gt;Many say their concern isn't tech employees but young men drawn to the area by the new bars, many of which cater to a straight clientele.

Money brings new bars, new bars bring people looking to get drunk and laid. Violence is the scourge of any place with a high density of bars and clubs. With Capitol Hill being the queer-hub of the city, that means that there are a lot of gay folks around for drunk, angry, horny 23-year-olds from the suburbs to misdirect their angst towards.

I'm a software engineer, and I acknowledge that it's probably not my colleagues (who wear sweatpants to work and think that Serbia is a delightful place to go on holiday) beating up gay and trans people. But we roll up the hill with our money and fill out the bars, the owners of which then make enough money to open new bars on the same block, making Capitol Hill the place that Jaegermeister puts up shit ads about becoming ""a legend"".

So they waited 3 months and assessed a $40 fee per crossing all at once.

They have a special court setup in the U District specifically for these tolls, so I contested, went in front of a judge who threw out all of the fees and as a bonus declared I also didn't need to pay the 3 months worth of tolls.

What if I wouldn't have won? They claimed they had the right to take ownership of your car if you couldn't pay! I don't live month to month exactly, but $3000 would have wiped out most of my buffer.

"TL;DR - Give 2 weeks and follow the golden rule and do what you would want an employee of yours to do if you were the boss.

I left MS a few years ago but this is what I did and they keep asking me to come back so I can't have done anything too bad. :)  

Here are some of my lessons learned:
- +1 to the person that said; do what you'd do anywhere else.  General rules apply; do what you would want someone that reports to you to do.  Try to finish up any work that is outstanding.  If you are in the middle of a project; make sure you've documented what needs to happen and when since someone is going to have to pick up what you're leaving.
- Not everyone is walked out.  
- The policy (at least a few years ago) was that if you were going to Facebook, Amazon, Google, or Apple then you were walked out; otherwise you got to finish up your work (though expect that your boss will start removing your from projects and new work).  It's up to you to decide what you want to tell them though, you have no obligation to say anything.  If you want to finish up what your working on then you can always say that you're going to take a job at a partner, doing a start-up, joining a friend at a company who has made you an offer you can't refuse, etc...  
- Make sure to tell your boss first; don't fall prey to telling friends and co-workers.
- Don't bash the company to friends and co-workers when you are leaving.  If you really want to tell people what you disliked you can do that over beers after you've left.  You've made the decision that's right for you; tanking moral on your way out the door is a bridge burning exercise.  
- It's also best to have packed away the things that are yours (I did this the night before and then put them in my car since if you're walked out you may have to make a list of what things were yours in the office and (at least for me) I couldn't remember everything that was mine at my desk. (it goes without saying here that if you take anything that's not yours it's theft)).  
- +1 to the person who said that you should avoid being bitter in the exit interview.  Stick to facts or things that are broadly applicable. 
- Draft your goodbye email before you resign as you may not have a lot of time once you announce (if you are going to one of the companies that you get walked out for going to).  
- List an external email or LinkedIn address in your goodbye email so people who want to stay in touch can (I can't tell you how many people have pinged me looking for gigs later in the career; it pays to network and to give others the opportunity to).
- Remember to give back all the MS property you have (badge, ORCA card, PRIME benefits card, laptop, any keys to facilities you have, etc.).  If you are paranoid you can hand these to your boss and ask to take a picture of them holding them.
- HR will want a written (or email) version of your resignation for their files.
- HR will remind you that you singed a non-compete, NDA, and non-poaching agreement; it's good to honor those things. :)

Given a colloquial ""early autumn"", my bet is on ~~Aug 23~~ Oct 25 - almost an inch of rain fell between 7pm-11pm.  ~~The previous day with any notable rain was July 12 (June 3 if you look at just evenings), by even the stretchiest of definitions, that's the earliest autumn date.  Aug 24 was also rainy, but less so.~~  It's possible that a rainstorm missed Boeing Field and hit OP, but seems unlikely, especially if it was such an intense rainstorm.

**TL;DR**: Were you born in Seattle on Oct 25-26, 1977, or do you know someone who was?  Maybe on or after one of the other days above?  Ask if dad's car broke down on the way to the hospital.  You just might make OP's day.

**Edit:** People have pointed out that my concept of autumn may be a bit...non-standard.  If OP's definition of autumn tends more towards the actual definition, some of the later dates (Oct 25? 28? Nov 1?) may be more likely.

**Edit2:** Okay, I get it, my concept of autumn is *really* weird.  I've adjusted my best bets accordingly.",false,false,t1_cqrps4x,cincodenada,,0,1430246065,t5_2qhad,t3_345ylg,t1_cqro81z,83,1432656059,0,0,cqrps4x,Seattle,83,,

"The Stranger reminds me of that crazy aunt/uncle you see mainly on holidays.  You were awestruck as a teen: they really *understood you* when your parents didn't.  They'd buy you booze, and you'll never forget the Thanksgiving you got high behind the garage while the adults were inside drinking their before dinner  cocktails.  The aunt/uncle seemed to discover all of the hip-cool places first and always had plenty of tales regarding their late-night adventures rubbing elbows with celebrities...

Now you're an adult, dealing with the real world first hand.  The aunt/uncle is still a wild and crazy free spirit - but at middle age, a little worse for wear and tear, and definitely a lot less lustrous.
They are still a fount of information - and how!  You find yourself more than a little irritated,  trying to extract some fun from their long-winded wackadoodle rambling.   You're way past getting stoned behind the garage because now you're drinking cocktails with the other adults (who are genuinely interested in what you've been up to and are taking you seriously).  Everyone laughs when you recount an amusing anecdote. Except for aunt/uncle who apparently wasn't paying any attention,  seated morosely on the sofa with the same posture as a bum on a park bench.  Suddenly you understand why mom always rolled her eyes and chuckled when you brought up the subject of aunt/uncle when you were younger.

"&gt;NY and San Fran have it (though I believe they use the term ""stabilization""), I don't see how it's some harmful notion.

Rent control in both NY and SF caused significant shortage in housing availability and higher rents in the non controlled areas. Check the numbers yourself.

You are a developer. You could build a residential property, providing more housing, or you could build a commercial property. Well rent control on residential properties means the potential income for you is capped, the commercial is not. So, naturally, you build commercial. There will be high density of people per residential property, because there are less properties available, because less people are building residential, because it's capped, and lower density of occupancy for commercial properties, which will be abundant. Check out ""Basic Economics"" by Thomas Sowell, he has very good analysis of previous instances of rent control and its effects on affordable housing, housing availability, and the economy. It's a great read and does not require a background in economics.

"I'm the friend and this is my story:

On Saturday night, I had friends over at my apartment to celebrate my 29th birthday. Around 10 pm, my friends started to get hungry (having already devoured all of the Skittles, Ring Pops, and snacks in my apartment), so not wanting anyone drinking-and-driving to one of the few still-open drive-thrus/restaurants in town, I placed a large order of barbecue, at my own cost, from Pinky’s BBQ in Seattle through Postmates.

The total cost of what I received was $111.18 according to the online system (in full disclosure, I authorized a total charge of $127.53 because I also ordered chicken which ended up being sold out). However, according to Postmates at the end of the transaction, my total bill was $153.70, an increase of $42.52 or 38% from the listed prices of what I received.

First thing yesterday, I went online to provide Postmates with the details of my transaction and ask how they could account for such a steep mark-up from the quoted price I had authorized. Rather than place the transaction on hold while investigating the situation (all they did was leave me a voicemail saying that they felt their extra charges were okay), Postmates processed my charge this morning for their full inflated total of $153.70. It was only at this point that I was able to see the receipt from the order, and I saw that the BBQ joint’s prices were as much as 21% higher than the prices listed on the website, and a 10% previously-undisclosed gratuity charge was placed on my order despite it being a delivery order. The Postmates service fee itself also increased 38%.

The issue is not a matter of me not being able to afford a financial hit of $42, but rather that this company does not seem to care to address the issues of its customers, and I believe that many, many more customers will get burned in the exact same way that I did in the future. The terms on their website states, “The Company reserves the right to determine final prevailing pricing - Please note the pricing information published on the website may not reflect the prevailing pricing.” However, I question the legality of such a broadly-encompassing blanket statement when they clearly increased my bill by a very significant amount of money, and they do not seem to be putting any effort into remedying the situation (you can still order from the very same restaurant right this moment with the exact same listed prices as I saw Saturday night).

Reddit, how can we get this company to change the way it’s treating its customers??

---

Edit: Here is another screenshot of the actual order confirmation page after payment, which then showed the active status of the order as the driver moved from the Capitol Hill area to Wallingford to my apartment, and finally indicated its completion. As previously stated, there is a chicken item on there that was canceled and removed because it was sold out: http://imgur.com/BI4OsNe

---

Edit 2 (9:15 pm PST): I just got off the phone with Andrew, the owner of Pinky’s, who assured me that Pinky’s has no direct involvement with Postmates and that he had not even heard of Postmates before today. On Saturday night, the Postmates driver had called me from Pinky’s and said that the employees at Pinky’s wanted me to verbally confirm that I would be accepting a &gt;$100 order before releasing my order to him, but I have no way to confirm or deny how aware the Pinky’s employees truly were/are about the existence of Postmates. Andrew graciously offered to make it up to me for my negative experience. While I again told him that it was totally unnecessary, we plan to at least meet up in person next time we are both in the area. As I have tried to convey all along, my main issue in this whole situation has always been with Postmates and not with Pinky’s. Now that I know that Pinky’s has zero contractual connection to Postmates, Postmates seems to be the only party to blame.

tl;dr: Pinky’s is a great local business (with amazing BBQ-topped mac-n-cheese). Postmates operates on the border of legality and should be avoided like the plague.

---

Edit 3 (2:40 am PST, 4/7/2015): In my phone call with Andrew, I had forgotten to address the issue of the automatic 10% gratuity added to my bill by Pinky's. I e-mailed Andrew to clarify, and he told me that the gratuity is their delivery fee that typically is only added to bills when Andrew does a rare personal delivery. Given the overall circumstances and the phone conversation that I had with the Postmates driver while he was at Pinky's, it seems like the cashier at Pinky's on Saturday must have known that they were making a transaction with an intermediate courier service and may have added that gratuity accordingly. However, this does not mean that the management of Pinky's had any awareness of the dealings that occur between front-of-house staff and couriers. I do hope that after my incident, this extra 10% gratuity/delivery fee will no longer be applied unless Pinky's employees are themselves making a delivery.",false,false,t1_cq3j8py,antau,Maple Leaf,0,1428363765,t5_2qhad,t3_31oq23,t3_31oq23,84,1432236050,0,0,cq3j8py,Seattle,84,,flair

"&gt; we simply don't have room for all these people.

Yes, we do.  49% of our land is zoned for single-family and we have the same amount of land zoned for commercial/mixed-use (6%) and multifamily (8%) as we do for parks (14%).  This doesn't include the parcels, like mine, that are *zoned* multifamily or mixed-use but have a standard house sitting on them.  ([Source.](http://www.seattle.gov/dpd/cityplanning/populationdemographics/aboutseattle/landuse/default.htm))  **Edited** to add: I am *not* advocating that the entirety of Seattle's SFH stock be leveled and 30-story condo towers be built in its place.  We do need a better mix and we need to stop cowing to neighbors who want to keep having regular SFH neighborhoods and 2-story ""quaint"" businesses next to multi-billion-dollar light rail stations.  If you want to compare Seattle to everyone's favorite, San Francisco, I'd point out that [half of San Fran's units are ""dense""](http://planbayarea.org/pdf/Draft_EIR_Chapters/2.3_Land_Use.pdf) (condo/townhome or multifamily) while under 20% of Seattle's are that way.

&gt; The hills and hour glass shape of the land restrict the ability to build the infrastructure we need.

Sound Transit is doing a great job tunneling their way to everywhere.  Dense cities require grade-separated and dedicated-lane public transit.  We're not all that dense and we don't have that much transit.  Both of these are increasing.

Is anyone forcing you to moderate this sub? If you do not have the time or cannot be bothered, please do everyone in this city a favor and find other endeavors that suit you better. There are many in this sub (not me) who can do it 10 times better.

&gt; Your refusal to bring up which user ban..

Again, I don't have a specific user in mind. I'm asking about all of them in general. After you insisted on specifics (to deflect the question) I asked you to pick any user from that sub -- most of them there have the words **""shadowbanned by /u/careless""** next to their names!!!! Was that too much work for you? 

You're going to deflect the question again, sigh.. 

Here we go: caremore, disabled_girl, rattus, extranoise, charlesgrodinfan, widdershins13, and more.. You asked for specific names, here they are. We're all waiting.

&gt; And now I'm done with you

Nice, very nice.

&gt; We don't reply to users when it's not productive to have a conversation about their ban.

You can't know what's ""productive"" unless you interact with them, can you? Your attitude is very unprofessional. If the courtesy of at least informing and answering users when you ban, not even once, and completely ignoring their modmail is too much work for you, perhaps moderating on Reddit is not for you.

Oh, and please have the courtesy to at least inform me when you ban me now (which I'm sure you will). And note to everyone else reading, that I broke no rules and did not call him names or been ""rude"" to him in any way (but somehow when others say ""GTFO"" or ""Fuck y'all"" is not rude).

You completely ignored what I asked. Please address my question about posting your ""reasoning"" on the sidebar in a clear manner for everyone here. Because it affects everyone here.

tl;dr: Politely asking moderator to stop being abusive to sub users, state rules clearly and be predictable, and to stop banning people and at least have the courtesy to be respond to users.

I don't think this is true. Townhomes exist because there is demand for them. They are another option among other housing options like single-familty homes, condos, or apartments. Townhomes give you your own plot of land with no neighbors above or below,  which usually also means there is no HOA to deal with. They also are more energy efficient than single-family homes because of the shared wall(s). Given the choice between a condo, single-family home, or a townhome, I prefer a townhome.

"This sounds like a potential [right cross collision](http://bicyclesafe.com/#rightcross).  This is probably the most common bike/car collision. 

You're probably wondering if you are at fault or if the cyclist is at fault.  A third option should be considered:  the bicycle lane is a bad-design at this intersection and partially to blame.  One of the mitigations for the right-cross collision is (from the above link) ""4. Ride further left"".  However, by riding in the bicycle lane, the cyclist is riding very far to the right.  Even worse, because it's a bike lane, the cyclist likely has an illusion of safety. 

[Vehicular cycling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicular_cycling), of which I'm a proponent,  states ""*When choosing where to travel on the street, vehicular cyclists ignore designated bicycle lane stripes. This does not mean that they avoid riding in bicycle lanes, rather deciding whether to ride in the space demarcated as a bike lane just as one would if the stripe were not there.*"".  When going downhill at high speed as a cyclist, I think it's a **very** bad idea to position myself in the bike lane: since this limits visibility and reaction time if I need to brake suddenly. 

I can understand the cyclist being angry (this has happened to me as a cyclist and it is very scary).  However, cyclists should recognize that their actions at least partially contribute to the risk, and likewise, their actions can also contribute to it's prevention.

regarding design of bike lanes (which isn't what OP was asking about, but I figured I'd drop my opinion in), I don't think this situation is going to change.  Seattle wants to make the city better for bicyclists, and when surveyed, many people state 'lack of bicycle lanes' as a primary reason for *not* cycling.  So, the city is going to continue plastering bike lanes all over the place, and more people are going to ride, many of whom are oblivious to this kind of danger.

"At the risk of spoiling the fun . . . I'm the guy.  What's going on is not really as scandalous or even as interesting as it may appear.  I use that old boat in an unconventional way by maintaining an ""invite yourself"" policy and by regularly inviting strangers to come aboard. Anyone who has been aboard can come again and bring whoever they like.  I pick people up and drop them off all afternoon and am never more than 5 minutes from my dock.  

There is sometimes some nudity (perfectly legal in Seattle) particularly when we're swimming but it's just a matter of individual preference.  There are all kinds of body types on board and my hope is that it feels safe and judgement-free for everyone.  I hope to be spared that judgement myself by those who come aboard but the people on other boats (or in buildings around the lake) will think what they will.  I suppose that any middle-aged guy in a speedo (or less) has to be prepared to deal with that - but it's still kinda fun. 

Hundreds of people have jumped on over the years and I am sure that some haven't enjoyed the experience in some way.  But countless others have had a great time. Some have become ""regulars"", and many have made new friends and furthered those connections outside the boat. We have handed out a lot of free beers to kayakers and rescued more than a few of them when they have flipped and can't get things sorted out.  And we have ferried our share of pooped-out paddle-boarders back upwind when they made the mistake of going downwind first.

And I'm not a tech zillionaire - in fact quite the contrary.  Keeping the boat going as I do is expensive for me but continues to be worth it. Some of the posts said the boat wasn't very nice - but it's certainly nice enough.  Its only purpose is to hold a bunch of friendly people on sunny afternoons and move them around on the lake a bit.  It seems to do that well enough.

When the crowds get big or ""free-spirited"" it is only natural that people try to make up little stories to explain what they are seeing.  I have heard some pretty funny ones over the years.  There are often many more women on board than men but that's only because most women bring women and most men bring women (some sociologist can work on that one).  Rarely do any of the women on board have any particular interest in me beyond the boat and I have no delusions in that regard (okay, mostly no delusions).  And it is definitely not a swinging scene - again, some funny ones over the years.

PREACH! Micro-condos in the U-District might be out of your reach.

You may get incredibly lucky if you can find one of those shared, communal houses that splits everything ""Commie"" style with an opening. This price is tough even in Renton or Shoreline.

Something you might want to consider is paying a bit more in rent to get more utilities covered.

I think the eastside school demographic is changing - it used to be that no one wanted to live around schools like Bellevue ~~Community~~ College.  From day one, they were always commuter colleges.  That no longer holds - the schools have upscaled their programs, the U has gotten obscenely expensive, traffic is ridiculous, etc - and so now people are starting to treat them more like ""campuses"" and want to live nearby.  But the problem is that they are surrounded by single family homes and there's been no accommodation for the now needed student housing.  So...it's a collision.
