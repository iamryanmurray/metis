"I voted yes. 

I'll be honest, I struggled with this decision. ST3 is not a perfect plan. There are lot of things I'd change about it. It is enormously expensive and the timelines for light rail are extremely long. However, this region desperately needs quality public transit. It will be better for the environment, it will be better for the regions growth, it will be better for traffic, it will be better for our quality of life, and it will raise the profile of our city. The up-front cost is high, as infrastructure always is. But it is an investment in our future that will pay us back in innumerable ways for decades to come.

"EDIT:

I get it. Looked it up. They have the gifted program in that school. Bus in kids from all around Seattle to get enriched services there. They also have special ed there. So some of the classrooms--which might not be labeled as HCC, but which are--have only high-achieving students. Most of those students are going to be students who tested in. And in case you aren't aware, people test-prep their kids for the gifted programs in Seattle, Bellevue, and Redmond. While the most highly gifted students obviously don't need preparation for that, the majority of kids there will be ""on the cusp"" because of the nature of the bell curve. Anyway, long story short: You can prep a kid for IQ tests, and certain groups do it more than others, and certain groups also know how to do it better than others. It's not exactly a fair system and probably never will be.

However, most likely, if your friend saw segregation, that's what it is. She wants her kid in the white/Asian class? Prep the hell out of her and get her in the gifted (""HCC"") program.

Or she could ask that her kid go to a different school where she is not going to witness the evidence of cultural, economic, and racial segregation seeping into the classroom from the adult world.

I'm probably just begging for downvotes but that's the sad truth. **Full disclosure: when it was all-district testing, my kid missed the program by one point. We agonized about prepping or not. It's technically not allowed but people totally do it and said so at the test.**

----
More edit: It is true that there are special services provided to HCC/gifted kids in WA. Their parents won a lawsuit a couple decades ago. I personally have found that even on the Eastside, the schools that were more integrated provided more opportunities for my high-IQ but not top 1% kids to shine. I prefer these because they tend to accept that a kid could be really advanced in one area, but not another, and that doesn't mean they don't need services. So maybe your friend could argue for her daughter to go to another neighborhood school based on that premise. I would consider it if I were her.",,,,[deleted],,,1478222937,t5_2qhad,t3_5az42t,t1_d9kvds6,12,1481194246,0,0,d9kvjl0,Seattle,,,

"If we eliminated all fossil fuels right at this moment we would be facing an electrical shortage because we just got rid of 2/3 of our sources of electricity. This would shut down business because the price of electricity would skyrocket, which would also put homeowners in the dark and leave them without jobs. This would also skyrocket the price of charging the electric cars you would replace all the fossil fuel cars with. Quick search says a fully electric car costs a family 540 dollars a year to charge. That price will likely go up by more then 100% in the case of getting rid of all fossil fuels in a short amount of time.

"Thank you for sharing your opinion.

To clarify:

- As my comments indicated we're both a. lucky to live in a pro-public transport city and b. actively working to try to improve it, that does in fact make it stellar (but definitely not perfect) compared to most of the US.

- I did not offer comparison of Seattle's transport vs any of the other large metro hubs as the fact we *have* multiple types of functioning public transport systems puts us miles ahead of most of the country.

- Seattle's transit systems are also limited by both geography/topology and exceptionally short-sighted decisions to not expand and rebuild the infrastructure in the 1960's before the massive population boom(s) occurred in the area.  We're certainly playing catch-up compared to other metros while dealing with region-specific challenges that have been exacerbated immensely by the current influx of population.

- I was raised in New England.  I'm well aware of what an amazing spiderweb of public transport (both rail and bus) can do for mobility across an entire region.

Exactly this. WA is not a battleground state.  And even if there was a slim chance that enough people in WA were to write in Sanders that it actually resulted in Trump taking that state then I think it would be a pretty clear message to the DNC that they F'd up by choosing to Run Hillary and suppressing the Sanders vote.

"I live about 250' from I-5. 

I can hear the freeway all the time. It's a light whoosh whoosh noise, day in and day out. It's so constant I don't notice it, unless I am listening for it. Then I pretend that it's a river. And it is - just a river of cars. It's louder in the summer, because I have the windows open.

I run an air purifier all the time. Even with that, there's a heavier layer of ""dust"" than if I weren't living so close to the freeway.

I think it makes a difference if you are living up from the freeway, versus down or on its level. The pollution, whether it's particulates or certain gases, are all heavier than air, so you're worse off in Eastlake than you are in ""I-5 Heights"" on the west slope of Capitol Hill.

Trump's winning the election had literally nothing to do with gerrymandering.  The argument could be made for the GOP's success in the House, but gerrymandering plays no part in the popular vote of each state.

IF the electoral college had been much closer (270 to 268), and IF Clinton had pulled BOTH one of Nebraska's districts AND the state's popular vote, then you could reasonably say that gerrymandering in NE potentially cost her the election.

"Yes, we were both wrong about Trump. But, you still don't see the problem. People weren't looking for the pragmatic, politically correct, balanced economic approach. They were looking for an upset. They were looking for someone to tilt the balance back to the people--someone to make them feel like they were the top priority on the agenda in Washington. Nevermind that it's all bullshit, and it's all a sham. 

People wanted to feel that way. Hell, I wanted to feel that way. That's why I was so fucking stoked for Bernie. The first time I listened to Bernie speak, I was completely shocked to be hearing a politician talk straightforward about the real issues. I honestly never thought I would hear a politician be that real. After the lack of positive momentum from the 2012 election, I was definitely expecting the worst. In any case, shit is simply broken for working/middle class people, and it's only getting worse. It's going to continue to get worse. Something was going to happen, and this was the election for it, apparently--no matter how important to Democrats it was that it was ""her turn"".

The real embarrassment of it all is that liberals are not even realizing this yet. Hillary had to be the nominee, because she was the only chance for winning. The sweeping, nasty generalizations of supporters of the opposition is like strategy #1 for Hillary supporters, whether it was the Obama Boys, Bernie Bro's, or now the racist, misogynist, xenophobes who supported Trump. Will anyone from the neo liberal camp take the simple opportunity to look at what the hell is going on in the world and realize that you have to address it. It seems to me that Hillary wasted a lot of energy on a low effort approach to try and ride on the coattails of the Obama administration. It didn't work out.

Full legalization is now in 8 states plus D.C.  Those are 9 areas in which the Feds cannot operate in concert with local law enforcement when going after cannabis.

Also the amount of locations that are now medical or decriminalized show even the Bible Belt is starting to change it's tune on marijuana (funny how all those religious folks can make excuses once they see the real god (money) begin to pile up).  

Going after pot at this point is only going to waste taxpayer dollars and is a losing battle.  Even the younger die hard Republicans have no issue with it.

"I lost my cool a few weeks ago.  Was walking down the street and some random dog that had to be around 60 lbs came sprinting full speed at my dog, which was leashed.  I yelled at it and got it to stop, and then I see the owner sitting in his yard about 100 feet away yelling ""it's fine"".  

He didn't move.  He just sat there.  I asked him to get his dog, so he said ""come"" a few times but the dog didn't budge.  I said something along the lines of ""it's the law that you have to have your dog on a leash"".  He told me to chill out and that dogs are pack animals.  And then the cherry on top was him saying that if I was a better pet owner, my dog would be more socialized.

Fuck.  That.

I adopted my dog from a North Carolina kill shelter when she was 5 years old.  She had been being used as a bait dog for dog fights.  So, as weird as it is, she's not exactly crazy about other dogs.  She's friendly with dogs she knows and has been properly introduced to.

Most of them took their kids out of the Seattle public schools and put them into Islamic schools that are honestly shitty. So those kids do not integrate and also get a shitty education.

Are literal lies. If you look at ST3's [numbers](https://st32.blob.core.windows.net/media/Default/Document%20Library%20Featured/8-22-16/ST3_Appendix-C_2016_web.pdf)  ST3 daily riders will be between 657,000-797,000, this is compared to the 390,600 of daily riders in 2014.

Without ST3 47% of the population would still be taking buses (today it is 83%), and you'd need to double the number of buses on the road as a result. With ST3 almost 70% of the population will be taking rail, which means they won't be increasing congestion to the roads.

"QFC north Broadway Capitol Hill. The one between Harrison and Republican, not the one on Pike. I should be there by 1:30-ish. I hope to get my paper selling done early because QFC closes at 6 today.

"There's a big difference between the two parties. Before the election even started, the DNC expected Hillary to win. I actually caucused for Bernie and a constant thing I heard was that people liked Bernie better, but they thought they'd vote for Hillary because they didn't like Trump and/or they expected Hillary to win anyway. It was very difficult to explain that the Primaries had nothing to do with who they would vote for this November if they were concerned about Trump and that the Primaries were when you decided who the best candidates are. My state still nominated Bernie in a significant margin of victory, but the lack of basic civics understanding is alarming. When the media was already declaring Hillary the winner before the first vote was cast, it stacked the odds against Bernie. If the race started on equal footing and wasn't influenced by ignorance and favoritism, it would have been very different. Finally, as internal DNC emails strongly show, the Party machinery was also doing everything it could to sway the Primary to Hillary.

For the Republicans, the field was greatly stretched. The fact that early Republican favorites were knocked out by negative campaigning and slandering meant that a lot of Republicans had the choice of a Party favorite they didn't want, or an anti-establishment candidate who could be the spoiler. Once Trump had gained a lead that made him almost unstoppable, I think a lot of early Primary voters began to regret their decision.

TL;DR, Trump in a large Republican and a narrow Democrats field, upset the results in both races. If he weren't in the race, the Republicans would have had a different nominee and Hillary would not have had as much support. The Democrats may still have nominated her since she was positioned by the media to be the default winner for the party. And if the DNC had not undermined any other candidate's chances from the beginning, Bernie may very well have been the Democrat's nominee.",,,,chinpokomon,,,1478243268,t5_2qhad,t3_5b0fa1,t1_d9l3t39,19,1481199923,0,0,d9l73v5,Seattle,,,

"Former landlord in Seattle for 8+ years here. You misinterpreted your lease renewal and don't have much recourse. The footnote of your renewal is just implying they will accept payment from that website between the last day of the month and the 5th of the month. Nothing more nothing less. It says nothing about what day your rent is due. Whatever day your lease says your rent is due on, it is due on. Most leases will say something like ""Rent is due on the 1st day of each calendar month...payments will be accepted up to the 3rd day of each calendar month."" ""If payments aren't submitted by midnight on the 3rd calendar day, then rent is considered late and a $35.00 late fee will be assessed... rent must be paid in full within 3 calendar days including the late fee with a certified check or money order..."" blah blah blah, something like this yes?!? Ya you owe the late fee.

This thread offers horrible advice. Your landlord can require (and likely will) rent paid in full and they can absolutely deny your rent check if you don't include your late fee. You CANNOT withhold your late fees or rent check in protest. You can/will be evicted disputing this. I've had to take dozens of tenants to court, and I can tell you that the language of the lease is pretty cut and dry. The only time small claims courts side with the tenant: 90% of the time when the landlord doesn't serve the client eviction paperwork properly, 10% misc. administrative error. This happens mostly with inexperienced landlords and rarely at that, and wouldn't be something to count on against Cornell. I've never seen a landlord lose to a tenant in a dispute over the wording of a rental agreement. As far as contracts go, they are pretty easy to understand and the judge usually agrees. Again, I've gone through this process dozens of times, and usually watch 3-5 eviction cases play out in small claims court whenever I go so I'm pretty well versed in how these things play out. 

If you want to know where you stand on this topic, you can just check out Seattle landlord-tenant law:http://www.seattle.gov/DPD/cs/groups/pan/@pan/documents/web_informational/dpdd016420.pdf

It's pretty straightforward as well. Washington State Tenants Union isn't going to do anything for you in this case. I would consider having a real discussion with the management instead of going down and explaining why you are right and they are wrong and pointing to this or that law. Property managers are trained in the laws of the industry more than pretty much any industry I have worked in, and Cornell isn't a two-bit operation, they are very likely going buy the letter of the law. The unfortunate side-effect of all the regulation landlords follow is that there is virtually no room for flexibility. Have them explain fair-housing laws to you and you will understand why. You may have a reasonable excuse for not paying your rent on time, but under no circumstances can they make an exception for you from a legal standpoint.

"When I ride, and I need to stop on a freeway due to traffic, I always always always look in my rearview to see if there is a danger from behind. Whether lane splitting is legal or not, a hyper-defensive rider could just move over to the shoulder in the case of a car that will not be able to stop in time. I'm not blaming this rider for the accident - he was not at fault. Just saying that lack of ""legal lane splitting"" does not preclude active defensive maneuvers.

Story time! Once, My brother, driving down a boulevard, approached a traffic signal that was turning from yellow to red.  Looking in his rearview he saw a car approaching in his lane, going much too fast to be able to stop. He looked, and then moved into the intersection, against the red signal. A moment later a car came screeching through in the lane he had just vacated, half-sideways, brakes fully locked.  Coincidentally, there was a police car waiting at the same intersection, at the cross street.  My brother, who clearly proceeded through a red signal in order to avoid the accident, was not cited. The other driver was cited.

Q: Would ST3 reduce congestion?

A: It would not.

What the plan offers is an escape from traffic misery, for people who can reach the stations on foot, on a feeder bus, or via park-and-ride. Commuters to central Seattle, to the airport from Tacoma, and from south Snohomish County to the University of Washington or downtown should save time.

"Hi, I'm /u/viamana, otherwise known as the ""homeless /r/seattle redditor"". While I am no longer homeless (I am a caregiver now for an elderly native American woman, and I sleep on her couch), we could not afford to purchase a turkey this year, or much of anything else, either. We had a whole thing planned to invite neighbors, of course I would do all the cooking, because, well, I love to cook (check out my [Allrecipes cook journal](http://dish.allrecipes.com/blogs/vaesolis).) I would be very interested in joining and helping in the kitchen, but I need to go out and sell some Real Change papers if I hope to afford anything more than a frozen burrito for dinner tonight.

I know my story sounds bleak, but I'm not actually a gross, dirty guy. Many folks here who have met me can testify to that. I have just been in a bind since I left Ireland and I miss my children (two sons) terribly, they are back home in IE.

I don't know how my day will progress, but I am taken by your offer. If things come about well and early, perhaps I will contact you. I don't know if I am the type of person you had in mind to reply, and if not, I completely understand, but what you are offering is exactly the type of thing I would do, if I were in a better position.

Contact me if you need any help or such. I just need to sell a few papers today, which hopefully will not take the entire afternoon.

"I totally agree with point you make in regards to citizens being first priority when it comes to economic opportunity. I am a foreign national and it is more expensive for my organization to keep me here than to hire a citizen. That was to dispel the notion that I am cheap labor.

Copy pasta from another comment thread regarding h1b:
Also, just found this on the official H1Bwage.com that average wages earned by visa holders is around $78000. Moreover, it has a cap of 85000 visas a year, 20000 of which are reserved for grad students and you need to have a minimum of a bachelors degree to apply for it. Even after you get the visa via lottery, if there is any ambiguity about what you are going to be doing, you are issued an RFE ( request for evidence), the petition for which could be rejected if USCIS feels that a particular position doesn't warrant a visa. Finally, majority of visa holders are either bachelors or masters students who have invested a lot of money into the American economy int he form of tuition, living expenses and of course, taxes. in fact, I have to pay higher taxes as compared to a citizen (not complaining, just pointing it out).

As far as owning real estate here is concerned, how about all the foreign multinationals that generate employment within the united states? Does your view also extend to commercially owned property or only housing because it affects you?

Lastly, growth in this case is a double-edged sword. It has generated a lot of employment while affecting affordability.  

I call Seattle home now. I love the music, the food and the general progressiveness that this city represents. Having worked extremely hard to be where I am, I just feel there has to be a solution that is more inclusive than just blaming people who settle here with no other intention than to make a living and enjoy what this beautiful city has to offer.

"When I first moved to Seattle, I invested in gear that was waterproof for bike riding. What I found after a year of bike commuting in Seattle, is that waterproof was the wrong idea. There are a few types of rainfalls in Seattle, and when it comes to biking in the weather, I really learned that ""waterproof"" was a poor strategy. The better strategy ultimately, was to acquire several layers that stay warm while wet, and then dry quickly. My formula looks like this:  
  
**1) Base Layer**: Go to the Ross store closest to you, and acquire a couple of pairs of compression shirts and boxers from the clearance portion of the ""active wear"" aisles. These will cost you about $6 per shirt/short, and will last you a surprisingly long time.  
  
**2) Mid Layer**: Hit up Performance Bike's online store and order a pair of their house brand ""Boundary II"" tights or bibs (around $35 on sale right now). Next grab a long sleeved cycling jersey; PB's house branded pullover hoody is on sale for $30 right now). The cheap option would be to pick up a long sleeved tech shirt with microfiber lining from Ross. They're around, but it may take a couple stores to snag one. One other hail mary pass on this item would be to hit the Goodwill on Rainier where they have a section of nicer branded tech gear in the $10-$50 price range that make for some good kit.  
  
**3) Outer Layer**: The ultimate outer layer for this area (on the cheap), imho, is the Showers Pass brand Storm jacket ($50) and Storm pant $(65). 
  
**4) Final Pieces**: Gloves, hat, socks, etc. Additionally, your life will be so much more pleasant if you also pick up a pair of shoe covers like the Performance Bike ""neo booties"" ($20, neoprene, covers above the ankle).  
  
The crux to this system is to go ahead and get wet, in the right way. You start your day a little cold, so you'll layer everything on. When the first beads of sweat start, strip a layer and stuff it in your pocket/bag. When you begin sweating through the hoody, strip down another layer. As you cool off and start to get chilled, add the layers back on. Now, the rains come. Is it the typical mist of the area? Then don't bother with the outer layers. _Let yourself get wet for as long as you're warm._ When you pop off the bike, go indoors, rain stops, etc., your gear will dry out quickly due to the performance characteristics of the tech materials, then you'll start to cool down, and then you'll add a layer on top again. Massive downpour? Full shell on until you begin to get wet from the wet/warm air layer made by the shell trapping your body heat and moisture. Open every pit zip and try to get that sucker to breathe. If you can't, ditch it and get wet until you're cold. Rinse, repeat. Good luck to you, and I'll see ya out there.",,,,SilverbackBob,,,1480283342,t5_2qhad,t3_5f7h1t,t3_5f7h1t,19,1481798721,0,0,dai3alf,Seattle,,,

"Edit: Just found out he is not, in fact, an intern but a level 4 SDE. So the transfer &amp; PIP make a bit more sense. For those that don't know the structure there, L4 is the most junior an FTE can be and, most of the time, they are right out of school - so the lack of experience still applies. I also found out that he joined the team 3-4 months ago, which, in my opinion, is way too soon to warrant a PIP. 

I posted this commentary on another social media platform today. Left this team earlier this year. By no means saying all teams are like this... but this one is. 

""So this happened today. This poor guy is a level 4 dev [Redacted: intern] for the team I used to work on and while I don't know him personally, I can definitely understand what drove him to want to take his own life after working alongside the people he called out in his email.

&lt;honesty-hour&gt; As most of you know, working for Amazon was by far the most challenging job I've ever had. Yes, there were good things about it - I learned a ton, my immediate team was amazing, and I made friends with really great people. 

That said, I'm still mentally recovering from that place. Even with over 10 years in the industry, it caused me to question my worth as a designer and as a person. I was so stressed out that I barely slept and when I did, I was dreaming about work. I was so depressed that I cried nearly every day for 6 months. I even, for a split second, had similar thoughts to those that this man took action on today (I immediately found a therapist instead). I was so ""in my head"" that it was near impossible to see it for what it was... just a job. &lt;/honesty-hour&gt;

Luckily for me, I had options. I have a great husband who supported me through all of that. I have a family and friends who knew I would succeed no matter what. I was debt free. I had experience. I knew that it was only a job... only a website. And I got out. 

Others aren't so lucky. Those on work visas. Those without a support system near by. Those who are too new in this industry to realize that there are other options. Pressured by finances, their home culture, or their own expectations of success. 

The problem... the very very big problem that this article doesn't state: This wasn't the first time that an employee put in a request to transfer teams and was blocked by their manager and put on a ""PIP"" or employee improvement plan. This group of managers is notorious for doing just that. For holding visas over their employees heads. For threatening them. And nothing was done to remedy the situation before it got out of hand. And now a poor intern felt he had no other options. Thankfully he lived... but for just a website?""",,,,Multicoloredjar,,,1480398138,t5_2qhad,t3_5ffewo,t3_5ffewo,124,1481843138,0,0,dak62ph,Seattle,,,

It is NOT fucking terrorism.  Don't put any sort of doubt into it.  It is NOT terrorism.  Sure, there should always be consequences of actions.

"First off, the first sentence of the Act basically says what voting yes means:

&gt;This act declares that the people of Washington State support amending The Constitution of the United States to eliminate the undue influence of concentrated money and political power on elections and governmental policy.

By voting yes, you aren't really voting on an immediate change. You are simply voting to show your support to amend the Federal constitution (basically an amendment to overturn the Citizens United ruling).

The main opposition argument is claiming that this is aiming to limit free speech. *Technically* that's correct, since Citizens United protected specific speech under the 1st Amendment. But 735 is specifically **aiming to support** an amendment that would limit the definition of a ""person"" to not include ""corporations"". It's not actually proposing a new law or amendment that would change that.

One of the lines in the argument is: ""*Forbidding citizens from spending their money spreading their beliefs is totalitarian, not democratic.*"". 735 is not aiming to prevent this. Citizens would still be able to spend money. Just a corporation wouldn't.

Another argument is posed as: ""*Should we empower congressional Republicans to censor corporations including Planned Parenthood, Playboy, PETA and WashPIRG? Absolutely not. Should we empower congressional Democrats to censor CareNet, Fox News, National Organization for Marriage and the NRA? Absolutely not.*"". This is more along the lines of the question you should answer for yourself (and vote accordingly). Should those corporations, regardless of their political alignment, be allowed to make political contributes (and specifically the corporations, not the people employed by them).

Ultimately, this Initiative is really just about showing your support. The chance that a constitutional amendment is actually brought up because of it would be incredibly small.",,,,notcaffeinefree,,,1478121870,t5_2qhad,t3_5arq72,t3_5arq72,11,1481159759,0,0,d9iyor8,Seattle,,,

"I am very familiar with this process, having worked in business immigration for over a decade. If the double whammy of 9-11 and the subsequent dot-com bust that happened after didn't get rid of H-1Bs, I doubt Trump will.  If you work in this legal area, you get used to hysterical things like this popping up with regularity.   

I have seen literally hundreds of H-1B paycheck stubs. Hundreds.  I do prevailing wage research as a normal part of my job.  These tech professionals are making BUCKS.  Every time yet another ""low paid H-1B"" article hits my eyes, I SMH. ANY time we have to go back to an employer to tell them they have to raise the salary offered, they don't blink.  The only low paid SWE I ever work with are on the ground floor of a friend's start up and are willing to take less than normal - and we can't let them do that per the law.

In the time I have done this work, the complexity of tech jobs has grown: the sheer number of programming languages, development tools, platforms, etc...and the multitude of environments they can be applied it, creates a long complex laundry list of skills and experience needed when a job opens up.

What really grinds my gears is when I do an H-1B for an experienced MS electrical engineer that keeps the whole grid WORKING is paid half of what some SWE makes as they develop yet another redundant app or application to sell us more crap.  

Don't buy the crap anyone tells you about H-1Bs being stuck at their jobs.  All they have to do is get another employer to sponsor them.  Half the work we do are H-1Bs called ""change of employer"". Shit, we've filed those with 48 hour turnaround: accept a job on Monday; get all your paperwork in FAST; file on Thursday, start your new job on Friday.

BTW: between legal and filing fees, an H-1B hire can cost an extra $5,000 than hiring a US worker.  And it requires maintaining extra paperwork and the possibility of DOL audits.",,,,Lucky2BinWA,,,1479771775,t5_2qhad,t3_5e65cp,t3_5e65cp,23,1481653758,0,0,daa8qpd,Seattle,,,

"Probably people who want to make a political statement by writing in a candidate other than one that appears on the ballot, such as Clinton, Trump, Stein, or Johnson, would want to make that statement heard.

It is important for them to know that their statement will not be recorded if they use Sanders, because of the rules on writing in candidates that have already been in the primary and who have not filed a declaration.

Washington State is already counting votes because we have all by-mail voting and it has already started, so my guess is that Gorshiea knows someone or themselves is on a vote-counting committee, and have seen write-ins for Sanders.

The intent of those voters (to send a message to the Washington State and national Democratic parties that they do not support Clinton but are liberals) is well-known, so Gorshiea is letting them know that Sanders is not the one to vote for.

Alternatives for those who would vote more liberal:

Jill Stein, Green Party (on the ballot)

Alyson Kennedy, Socialist Workers

Gloria Estela La Riva, Socialism and Revolution

"What is pence going to drive the bus of rednecks over? 

There's a lot of logical and logistical flaws in these fears people are having. Trump doesn't care about marriage enough to protect its ""sanctity"", he's defiled it enough times on his own, and Pence is just an idiot lackey to make the Republican establishment happy. Do you think Pence has a secret sick fetish for torturing gay people and that Trump will allow him to indulge in it in the white house basement? Will they create special forces for spotting and beating up ""queers"" like in some 80's scifi paperback novel, or maybe certain places in the middle east?

Gay marriage is accepted culturally in the US, or at least well enough that fighting it would be like fighting the tide. Conversion therapy is a dream few of the few remaining haters still think has any merit, even if they hate gay marriage. It would be more difficult to get rid of it than any of them care to bother with. Trump doesn't care enough and would rather not throw rocks at a bee hive without at least a promise of honey.

I can also tell you that Amazon is full of compassionate people that want to help. The problem is the big corporate beurocracy that can get in the way. The PIP-blocked-my-transfer is one of the biggest pain points for a bad manager making the experience even worse for people already having a bad time. It really does suck. I've known great people who got stuck with a PIP and tried to transfer anyway. HR wanted to help, there were even other teams that wanted him, but it was nearly impossible to get a Director or VP to sign off on it to override the PIP.

"This is a false dilemma. Czech Republic and Slovakia peacefully ""divorced"", what's to say that this process has to involve bloodshed?

Given human nature, war and strife is likely the case, but that doesn't mean that if the idea is good, we shouldn't try the ""legitimate"" means first. It gives these sorts of movements international support (e.g. Palestine, South Africa, Cuban embargo), which can be useful when things require force (e.g. the French in the American Revolution).

There are those who are not de facto protected in this union, definitely there are those who are not de facto powerful in this union. Sometimes what choice does a people have? I'm not saying we are there yet, but ""secession is never acceptable"" is the very thing, that the nation, from whom ""it is not acceptable to secede"", did to even exist. So that can't be a true statement, because it undercuts the very legitimacy of the United States.

I reckon it won't end democracy. Can't kill the idea, only the storage for them, and that's increasingly difficult to do that en masee, because of exponential population growth.

If we use the right kind of pressures, economically and so forth, the movement won't lose. But even if war (which, yes—it can be a bit bloody, I'm afraid) is the course, who's to say outright we'd lose? IT's not black-and-white.

"This is a bit misleading by way of omission.

[Yes, you can still write in ""Bernard Sanders.""](http://www.seattleweekly.com/news/bernie-supporters-if-we-write-him-in-theres-still-a-chance/) Write-in votes will be counted collectively, but only sussed out if the number of write-ins *exceeds* those of the named candidates.

That is to say that you can write in a candidate and not forfeit your entire ballot--your votes for initiatives, congress, etc. will still be counted.

The editor added this note to the Seattle Weekly article cited above:
&gt;Editor’s note: Several readers have written to point out that Sanders did not file as an ‘official’ write-in candidate in Washington state. That is true, however it doesn’t really matter in Washington. According to the Secretary of State’s office (emphasis ours): “The only way he would be an “official” write-in candidate would be have personally filed with us by Oct. 21. He did not, of course. But our state treats all write-ins the same, counting all of the combined votes into one single pot and announcing how many were cast. The only time the counties split out the write-in votes by candidate is if the total exceeds the vote for the winning candidate. Presumably that wouldn’t happen in this case. Official designation sometimes is helpful for write-in candidates at the local level. Occasionally a write-in who didn’t file for office or run in the primary is able to win as a write-in for mayor or council or whatever. If the county splits the write-ins out by candidate, the official designation allows election officials to credit any form of the person’s name.”",,,,fluecured,,,1478242088,t5_2qhad,t3_5b0fa1,t3_5b0fa1,52,1481199719,0,0,d9l6p9d,Seattle,,,

"Being able to move wherever you want. In this context, higher skill people are coming to Seattle because we have high-wage/high-skill jobs available, a good thing. These high wages are driving up the cost of living here, pricing natives out of their areas.

Creating artificial barriers to living, like limiting higher price condominiums in an effort to make housing affordable, benefits *a few* lower income residents, while displacing *a few* higher income residents, thereby limiting geographic mobility in the name of native protectionism. 

The truth is we have the highest concentration of single-family housing of any big city in the nation. Look at west Seattle, beacon hill, Fremont, Wallingford, and laurelhurst.

"As a student who participated and helped organize this walkout, I've got a couple things to say.
First, it was completely student led and organized. No teacher encouraged us, but at the same time we were not discouraged. Because that's how the first amendment works.

Second, it was a completely peaceful march. There was no blocking of traffic, no obscene behavior. In fact, we even stopped at every crosswalk. Peaceful protests are legal, but jaywalking isn't.

Third, we have gotten a lot of backlash and hate from people telling us to get back to school, get a job, calling us spoiled entitled brats, etc. Myself as well as many of my peers work our asses off every day with AP classes, jobs, and the societal expectations of becoming a teenager. If two class periods missed was the price to pay to spread awareness, then that's fine with me.

Lastly: We were not protesting to try to impeach trump, to try to change things now that we didn't get our ideal scenario. No, we were trying to spread awareness that these next four years are going to become a lot more difficult for not just minorities, but all citizens of the United States. We were and are completely informed of the message we are trying to convey. It's not about trying to change things directly right now. It's about spreading awareness for the fact that we, as people of the US, will have to rise up and stand for what we believe in over this next presidential term

Meetup.com, bars (when you hit 21), your future coworkers. Do things you enjoy, youll meet people through that. Use dating websites to meet up with people to try a new restaurant out.

"She at worst has a personality disorder and that is only a guess, Internet diagnosis is not a real thing. 

But even then speaking from personal experience that does not rob you of free will. Yes it makes you inclined to certain behaviour but you still have to pull the trigger. Plenty of people with personality disorders manage to control and regulate their behaviour. 

I'm very wary of people excusing bad behaviour with mental illness. Because ultimately the lines between mentally ill behaviours and simply immoral behaviours blurs, research indicates the vast majority of violent criminals suffer from some form of mental illness. 

But society can't be seen to condone and allow destructive and immoral behaviour simply because the person enacting it is possibly mentally ill. Because that incentivises others engaging in such behaviour to falsely claim they are mentally ill and incentivises genuinely ill people to behaviour how they want. Both cases put people around them at risk. If Zarna really feels ashamed and embarrassed of her behaviour (which she clearly doesn't) then hopefully that serves as a stimulus for her to realise her behaviour is unacceptable and destructive and seek treatment and support to reduce her inclinations to such behaviour. 

At the end of the day my sympathy is with a man who was falsely accused of sexual harassment in a devious plot against him simply because he spoke in support of police officers who had assisted his drug addicted daughter. She wilfully put him at risk of physical violence and arrest by trying to incite a crowd against him and has then tried to fraudulently scam unsuspecting and sympathetic people into financially supporting her (a middle class women originally of Indian upper class Brahmin). He however has used the publicity to support a women's substance abuse charity (Hope Soldiers if anyone wants to donate) that helped his daughter raising thousands of dollars for them.

* Tradition.

 They don't load their burgers with ingredients until one needs a plate and an unhinged jaw to eat it, that's for sure.


Edit: 1) White Castle is famous for the distinct onion flavor and small size of their sliders. It's a gimmick, yeah, but it's an effective one.

 2) In &amp; Out is famous for having some of the freshest burgers in fast food. They won't let a chain open unless they can hook up with a local meat distributor.

"There's some evidence that some of these protestors are being paid/funded by Soros-backed organizations. 

United We Dream is actively protesting against Trump and is backed by Soros.

https://i.sli.mg/PHJtYS.jpg

There are archived Craigslist ads from major cities across the US that are looking for protestors *specifically* against Trump and are offering $15-20/hour.  This isn't community organizing against real issues; it's simply to protest against the President-elect.

EDIT: If you're interested, here's a [60 Minutes interview on Soros from 1998](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8Ux5b6YM9A).  Note his comments on being amoral and how he doesn't think about the societal impact of his decisions.  Then realize he donated more than $25 million dollars to Clinton this year.

Whether Capitol Hill, Fremont, Wallingford, Green Lake, Queen Anne, U District, or even on the east side in Kirkland, there's always some great stuff to do, pretty scenery to see, and yes it's pretty easy to get around on transit.

Lots could be improved - support for the homeless, housing costs, even better transit, etc. - but you have to be pretty cynical to not appreciate what's here now. Especially as someone who was born and raised in the midwest where it's literally impossible to go anywhere without a car, where transit is a complete piece of shit exclusively designed (poorly) for those who can't afford cars, and on and on.

- There was a heavy aroma of weed
- The procession was actually quite large, the attached picture doesn't do it justice, it took about 6 minutes to pass the point I was at from start to end.
- The cops were pretty chill and there was no violence from anyone I saw in the protesters group

"What's the invasion? How is it ultimately hurting the country? Are illegal people taking all the white peoples' jobs? Are they the source of terrorism? Since you call it an ""invasion"", I'd love to know more!

I don't think there's an invasion in progress. I think immigrants, regardless of immigration status, are not even close to being the source or root of the problems.

Get rid of the corruption and money in politics. Our Congressional Reps and Senators have been screwing people over to help corporations. Our politicians want to give massive tax cuts to the rich, reduce or get rid of the minimum wage, and deregulate the hell out of everything. Of course, if it wasn't for illegal immigrants, all these problems would go away, right?

The larger problem in this country is entitlement. I'm not talking about people using food stamps to buy groceries. I'm talking about the lazy types, who never had ambition in life, who think college educated folks are all brain washed elites, who believe anything that's not Fox News, Rush Limbaugh or Breitbart is some kind of ""disease"" (in their own words), who have nobody else to blame for their shortcomings other than immigrants - because that's extremely convenient.

Historically, when things aren't working out that great, no matter what country, people always tend to blame the immigrants. The ""illegal"" status thing, as far as I'm concerned, is more or less a ruse.

"This isn't about the media. People are upset because of what Trump himself has actually literally said and done, and what his politics are. 

He outright lies and makes things up all the time. His campaign has shown an unprecedented disregard for the truth. He bullies people who work for him and who disagree with him. He hasn't paid taxes in 20 years. He has attacked all kinds of people for little or no reason, including veterans, a gold star family, women, celebrities, critics, etc. He literally said there should be some sort of punishment for women who have abortions. He called Obama a non-citizen for years, then called him ""The literal founder of ISIS"" in his rallies. He seems to have no understanding of how our federal government actually works. He has repeatedly called climate change a hoax. He disparaged John McCain for getting captured in Vietnam, in spite of dodging the draft himself. He was a candidate who broke the fifty year tradition of releasing tax returns prior to the election. He has continually repeated and propagated numerous conspiracy theories. He encouraged Russia to engage in cyber attacks on the United States. He has assembled the most regressive, anti-environmental, protectionist platform ever seen in the last 100 years.

"Here is my honest perspective as a local nonprofit volunteer admin. I'm have no intention to Scrooge or Grinch you. You obviously mean well, so I'm not meaning to be Debbie Downer or to troll when I say...

* Yes, for Thanksgiving at most places you needed to sign up earlier.

* Nonprofits need volunteers throughout the year, especially in the winter. People who only volunteer on Thanksgiving are kinda energy drains for nonprofits. There really isn't that much of an increased demands for help on holidays. Also, depending on the nonprofit, holiday volunteers sometimes make our jobs harder as we have to do more paperwork &amp;/or data entry for people who only show up once or twice. Our naive hopes are that you will volunteer for Thanksgiving, have your heart-strings tugged, like the work, and come back regularly to volunteer or give us $$$ - but sadly, that rarely happens. Vol. admins often feel like these volunteers are only volunteering to feel better about themselves rather than actually making a difference or making a sacrifice.

* If you still really want to volunteer, you might still find something at [Volunteer Match](http://www.volunteermatch.org). 

* Or make up your own independent volunteering for the day: pick up trash in your neighborhood, offer a service your capable of on nextdoor, buy as many socks or sweaters or gloves or rain slicks as you can at Costco or Goodwill and hand them out in Pioneer Square.",,,,NotLurk1ng,,,1479954857,t5_2qhad,t3_5ekjum,t3_5ekjum,12,1481711093,0,0,dadb62c,Seattle,,,

The City of Seattle defines (for planning purposes only) the neighborhood boundaries [this way](http://i.imgur.com/FkJK9Fy.jpg) and in their data notes the boundaries are not official. [This map](http://i.imgur.com/kEOK4AU.jpg) from Kroll Map Company shows these areas overlaid on a US topo map and was used as inspiration. I also referred to [this illustrated map](http://i.imgur.com/eBVFNSY.jpg) for the names of some of the neighborhoods. 

It wasn’t my intention to make a definitive map of Seattle neighborhoods or anything like that. The point of this was to make nice looking poster/reference map that mimics a classic [geopolitical map](http://i.imgur.com/egIMNbo.jpg) showing the areas as *states* within a *country* along with native geographic information using open data.  

 [Album]( http://imgur.com/a/Rwuzf). 

EDIT - some names on the map slipped through the spellcheck and will be corrected ASAP.  Please let me know if you catch anything.  Thanks!

Fine, vote against transit options that will efficiently get people in to and out of the city but then don't complain that parking is expensive and you can't get around downtown because it is grid locked every morning and afternoon.

Transit options, like light rail, are exactly that. Options. You aren't going to be able to entice everyone out of their cars and on to light rail but that isn't the point.

"Noooo... quit parking there, people, or I won't have anywhere to park! 

Lol, just kidding. I park there almost every day somewhere between 6am and 10am. At 6am there's a lot more parking on good levels like 2 or 3. Over the next four hours people usually take all the good spots. 

If you get there at 8am and everything near ground levels looks taken, my word of advice would be to not bother with going down to the basement. Go up, round and round. I've never seen there not being enough parking space. Levels 1-4 get filled really quickly but 5A or something like that will always have a space or two. 

I always take a picture of where I park so I don't get lost and I usually try to park on the lowest level can I get. So I went through my pictures and look at some of the photos of the parking region and the time of the photo and collected them below. Consider that I will try to park as closer to level 2x as possible, so if I parked at 4x that probably means all the levels below 4th were perceived as entirely full. If I parked at 5x that means all the levels below 5th were perceived as entirely full.

Today the picture was taken at 10:19 AM and the level is 5F. This means levels 1-4 were full.

...

Yesterday at 7:51 AM and the level is 4F. This means levels 1-3 were full.

Edit: I'll add that you should definitely check with your office admin before getting personal packages delivered to your office. Also, this probably works best for small to medium sized businesses. 

And one other option is there are coffee shops around town like sip &amp;  ship that will accept packages and hold them for you. A great alternative for those who can't get things delivered to work for whatever reason.

"I'll try to touch on both your points:

Access to affordable housing and well-paying jobs are bedrock social justice issues in this country.

I have a big problem with any foreign national displacing any US citizen in any context because I believe all citizens should be in front of all foreign nationals in terms of access to economic opportunity. I'm certainly not the only one. For example, I think that it should be illegal for foreign nationals to buy real estate in the US because I don't think that US citizens should have to compete with foreign nationals for housing. I think work visas for foreign nationals should be issued sparingly and only as a last resort. There are already an estimated 500,000 people in the US on the H1-B visa, and that's before we even discuss the fact that non-profits ( AKA the vast majority of universities and hospitals in the US ) are competely and utterly exempt from the annual caps.

- nominate Supreme Court justices who will threaten LGBT rights and even Roe v Wade

"We have a couple of rottweilers. We take care to try to make sure they stay away from public as our older one has anxiety issues and he just doesn't like other people- he's too protective and yeah, we're pretty shitty for not taking care of that behavioral issue earlier on. My husband's a hermit so the dog acts like one, too. 

Anyhow- we like to walk down logging roads and will not go down any that are already obviously in use. We keep both the dogs on leashes because, well, they're rottweilers and any mess up on their part could end up very badly. 

One day we were walking back to our car and ran into a couple with two unleashed dogs. One was a large choc lab which stayed by its owners' sides; the other was some small breed and took off right after us. My husband had control of our older rottie and I had our younger one. The little dog ran straight to our 140lbs rottie and started nipping his legs. It was so bad. Our dog was snapping at the little dog and my husband was back-peddling with him but couldn't get him to lie down like we normally do when he gets overly excited because the little dog was not backing up. 

It was one of the most helpless feeling moments of my life. I just knew that little dog was about to be killed or hurt and our dog would be blamed since he is a ""big, scary Rottweiler."" 

I am screaming my head off, ""You need to come get your dog! Now!"" The owners are casually strolling up, laughing, ""Oh he won't hurt you!"" 

""NO! YOU NEED TO RUN AND GET YOUR DOG NOW OR HE IS GOING TO BE HURT!""

They kicked it into high gear at that point and did grab their little dog before anyone got hurt but it really pissed me off. They caused a huge set back in our larger dog's training, all because their little dog was off leash, wasn't trained, and ""wouldn't hurt anyone.""

"&gt; Light rail has always failed in cities as sprawling as Seattle.

Seattle has unique topographical challenges that none of those similarly sprawling cities you mention faced. As a result, despite our low density we have traffic problems that other “sprawling cities” do not.

Unlike those other cities, middle class people will (and do) opt for rail over driving here.

Plus, the nature of our sprawl has been changing with the coming of light rail.  Most of the suburbs are creating massive upzones around their ST stations:

* Shoreline is going from suburban single family lots and cul-de-sacs to midrises in the walkshed around the two ST2 stations they are getting.

* Lynnwood won a federal grant to replace miles of strip malls around their ST2 stations with a new walkable downtown.  

* Federal Way is willing to go full blown highrise.  The only thing stopping them is a lack of economic demand (which will change after rail arrives there in a few years).  

* Apparently, even entirely one story Fife is looking at walkability and major upzones in a potential ST3 scenario.

* Surprisingly, the City of Seattle is the only city that is balking at meaningful upzones around ST stops.

"Islamic theology commands Muslims to kill the gay people who have same-sex sex. Mainstream Islamic scholars would highly condemn LGBT people by using the stories of Lut  and punishment in the fire as a warning, and transgender people wouldn't be accepted because a man who dresses as a female is believed to be cursed. Killing off or forcing LGBT people to suppress their nature would be ideal in an Islamic state. However, Muslims (the practitioners) are very diverse and hold many different ideas, so aside from the obvious fundamentalists who support the original Islamic teachings, more 'liberal' Muslims will either ignore the issue completely or justify the issue using mental gymnastics.

"I'm convinced that a very small proportion of the population actually thinks Trump will make a good President.  Deep down, damn near everybody knows he's going to make an unholy mess of it.  

This was a pure rage vote against both the establishment and the holier-than-thou portion  of the left that have spent a substantial portion of the last ten years hurling mostly unwarranted insults at rural and middle class Americans.  That particular group really needs to look back at Bernie again, because I'm pretty sure they missed the core of his point.  Namely, inclusiveness and hearing everybody out.

Middle America has been hurting socially and  economically since the second half of Dubya's second term but no one has really given enough of a shit to address it, so they were already primed to vote anti-establishment.  On top of that, it turns out that the portions of the left being obnoxious (dare I say, even bigoted) toward them didn't exactly encourage them to vote Democrat.  Hillary represented both of those things to them, so their reaction was to flip the bird and burn down everybody's shit.  Smart? Probably not.  Understandable?  Yeah, I get it.

"We here in the People's Republic of Seattle do *way* more than our part in electing liberals and voting for liberal policies at the local, state, and federal levels. [This election was no exception.](http://www.seattletimes.com/opinion/there-wasnt-a-trump-effect-in-washington/)

President-elect Trump is a big ""Fuck you!"" from rural America to us and other cities like us. And I don't want to be all ""they hate us for our freedom,"" but they really are largely motivated by our successes. Trump won, in part, *because* we've successfully organized to do things like pass non-discrimination ordinances, legalize cannabis, and keep our local police from becoming an arm of ICE.

They say all politics is local, but it's not this time. We can't organize or vote our way out of being hated in Indiana. In fact, the better we govern ourselves, the worse the resentment gets: not only are we threatening their social order, but we're doing better economically too, and it must be because we're taking their hard-earned tax money (never mind that the opposite is true).

Protesters in Seattle protest because they don't know what else to do. The only way to make their votes and organizing efforts matter at the federal level would be to leave Seattle and colonize Real America. Which isn't a terrible idea in the aggregate, but it obviously isn't very attractive on an individual level.

- You can disagree with him on appointing a climate change denier as head of the EPA. You don't have to wait. It's been done, and it's outrageous.

- You misread what I wrote about the War on Drugs. He threatens the *rollback* of it; i.e., we as a society have made strides in ending the War on Drugs in the last decade, and his administration is about as pro-Drug War as it gets. Giuliani, Christie, Gingrich... they're *vehemently* anti-MJ legalization and pro- tougher drug laws.

"You know everyone here is talking about entitlement and just not wanting to be in class and I remember when people said that about me when I was in HS in Seattle. My (now) wife and I walked out to protest the Iraq War and there were plenty of people who claimed we did it for skipping more than because we cared.

This attitude is so wrong. Yes, there are people who would take advantage of that, but treating these kids like they are all just lazy, entitled whiners is not only insulting, but also only serves to make a sharper divide between people.

Right now I am in Chicago and there is a protest going on at Trump tower at this very moment and I think what I have heard from people there says it best. Its not about being entitled, or thinking that your protest will change things. It's about showing the city, the country, and the world that there are a lot of people who are frightened and upset over this and they don't want to be ignored.

For HS students its the same. These are people who had no voice in this election. They are angry. They are scared. They are sad. And right now there are a lot of them that want to show the world that they do not support this, that, in fact, they actively are against it.

This is what we want from the future of our city and our country. We want people who are smart and active in society. Calling them all entitled doesn't solve anything.

And, yes, I am biased about this. I was one of those students and today I am a 1L at one of the top rated law schools in the country.

&gt; Third, we have gotten a lot of backlash and hate from people telling us to get back to school, get a job, calling us spoiled entitled brats, etc. Myself as well as many of my peers work our asses off every day with AP classes, jobs, and the societal expectations of becoming a teenager. If two class periods missed was the price to pay to spread awareness, then that's fine with me.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Lastly: We were not protesting to try to impeach trump, to try to change things now that we didn't get our ideal scenario. No, we were trying to spread awareness that these next four years are going to become a lot more difficult for not just minorities, but all citizens of the United States. We were and are completely informed of the message we are trying to convey. It's not about trying to change things directly right now. It's about spreading awareness for the fact that we, as people of the US, will have to rise up and stand for what we believe in over this next presidential term
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Sure, there were some kids who just used it as an excuse to skip class. But the huge majority were informed students who wanted to bring some awareness to a future that will directly affect all of us, which we had no say in

We are trying to spread awareness, not just throw a tantrum because we didn't get our way. Those were the results of the election, nothing we can change about it. But what we can do is prepare ourselves for the next four years, and start spreading the message of equality and love which should be a priority no matter what your political affiliation is",,,,shitsk8s,,,1478743412,t5_2qhad,t3_5c32by,t1_d9tqotl,23,1481356776,0,0,d9tqwh1,Seattle,,,

"I'll chime in as someone who went on a PIP as well.

Worked for exactly 1 year and 3 days.  Frankly, I was thrown on a team in which I REALLY wasn't a good fit.  Graduated with a degree in computer engineering with a focus on the electrical/circuitry stuff and only really good at coding in Java, and was thrown onto a team where I was maintaining a web application in Java, Scala, Javascript, and RoR.  The last 2 I had NEVER done any work with and had no idea how to work with web concepts, and struggled quite a bit the year I was there.

I knew I was in hot water by my annual review, but I only got a PIP 4 months after my abysmal annual review.  The second I got the PIP, I frantically started applying to jobs like no tomorrow.  I knew what the end game would be with this, having just read the recently released NYT article about the practice.

That being said, I was very fortunate in many ways.  I was a FT SDE1, and had some level of comfort with respect to the work I did.  Sure, I was pulling 70-80 hour weeks for a while, and sleeping in the office 2-3 times a week, but I still had more flexibility and comfort than many other workers (WELL above average salary, flexible hours if I wanted them, comfortable office space, all the coffee and snacks I needed, and a somewhat sympathetic manager who more or less gave me the impression that he was just a cog in the system).  I am also a US Citizen who had saved up over 6 months of living expenses since starting, and through some miracle was also given a nice severance package.

"10 times out of 10 I will vote for somebody who *supports science* (see fracking comments below), over somebody who *rejects science.*

&gt; EPA, June 4: We did not find evidence that these mechanisms have led to widespread, systemic impacts on drinking water resources in the United States. Of the potential mechanisms identified in this report, we found specific instances where one or more mechanisms led to impacts on drinking water resources, including contamination of drinking water wells. The number of identified cases, however, was small compared to the number of hydraulically fractured wells.

&gt; This isn’t to say fracking has been proven safe. The EPA’s report does indicate contamination can occur. And Sanders was correct when he followed up his comments on fracking by noting its potential impact on climate change.

&gt; Scientists have found that the process of fracking can lead to methane leaks. According to the EPA: “Pound for pound, the comparative impact of CH4 [methane] on climate change is more than 25 times greater than CO2 over a 100-year period.”

&gt;16-year-old Tukwila student reported missing in Sumner

&gt; Josiah Hokanson, 16, of Tukwila was reported missing Wednesday and is believed to be in Sumner, according to police.

&gt;BY KENNY OCKER
&gt;kocker@thenewstribune.com

&gt;A 16-year-old Tukwila boy was reported missing Wednesday and is believed to be in the Sumner area, according to police.

&gt;Josiah Hokanson, 16, left Aviation High School in Tukwila on Tuesday afternoon, telling his family by text that he left school early and would be taking a bus home, according to Tukwila police.

&gt;Highline School District spokeswoman Rexanna Graham said Josiah lives in Sumner. Aviation is a magnet school for aviation-themed studies, she said.

&gt;“We’re very concerned about Josiah and his family, and we’re helping in any way we can,” Graham said Thursday. “... We just really are holding Josiah and his family in our hearts right now, and hoping that they are able to find him quickly.”

&gt;Cellphone records show Hokanson made it to the Sumner area before sending the text messages, police said.

&gt;Hokanson, who is 5 foot 10 and 120 pounds, was last seen in a dark hoodie, a gray dress shirt and gray slacks.

&gt;Anyone with information on his whereabouts is asked to call Tukwila police at 206-433-1808 and reference missing person case No. 16-7996.

The question is why aren't law enforcement, enforcing them?

"None. Even in the Wiki article you mention, it cites: *There is no legal basis a state can point to for unilaterally seceding.*

I'm kinda of curious where you're finding this ""except in the case of outright federal government oppression of The People's Life and Liberties."". *Texas v. White* decided that states are not allowed to unilaterially secede. In that case, Texas legislature passed and then the state voted on (and passed) an ordinance to secede. The finding of the Court says nothing about ""life and/or liberties"". In fact, it *does* say: *""There was no place for reconsideration or revocation, except through revolution or through consent of the States""*. Their view is/was that a state can only secede by revolution or a consent of the States.

So sure, a state could do what Texas did and pass legislature declaring their secession. But then they would have to somehow win a revolution against the United States. And good luck doing that.",,,,notcaffeinefree,,,1478762740,t5_2qhad,t3_5c6k7f,t3_5c6k7f,18,1481362478,0,0,d9u23is,Seattle,,,

Considering the president-elect incited violence at his rallies, people are reasonably scared for their safety if they are one of these minority groups that have been targeted. There have been gay-beatings all across the country, and millions are living in fear of being separated from their families. 

Protesting is a way to literally show the racists, misogynist, and homophobes, that these are the people standing against that in the community, no matter how much Trump wants these people to be oppressed. It is to reassure our LGBT friends that they don't have to go back in the closet, our Muslim friends that we stand for their 14th Amendment rights, that we won't tolerate families being separated and that we will fight for our women's reproductive health. It's to reassure each other that we stand together, that we have the support of each other, even when we don't have it from our government.
