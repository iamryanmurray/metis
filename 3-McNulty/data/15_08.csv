"I think the most important lesson for Seattle (and other US cities with ambitions to reduce car dependency) is that transportation in Denmark/Europe is not primarily a result of some fundamentally different culture or having mediaeval cities. Most of Copenhagen didn't exist 100 years ago. Copenhagen, Amsterdam and other ""best-practice"" cities were drowning in cars in the 1960s. What you see today are the results of a deliberate 50 year process that has focused on investments in bike infrastructure, transit-oriented development and public spaces in the urban core.

"[throwaway because Amazon hate]

&gt; Or at least they are so secretive about it that it's basically the same thing. 

I keep my charitable donations private and anonymous when I can. When I was kid watching M.A.S.H. the one episode where Winchester tries to give sweets to the orphanage struck a chord and ever since then I've tried to not brag about donations. Lacks class.

I'll share an anecdote, though. I frequently walk past Urban Rest Stop Care on 9th Ave. when coming and going from meetings, and shortly after moving here decided it would be a good place to donate to. So I did and do. Today some guy making use of the place who's on the sidewalk starts muttering ""asshole, fucking geek"" as I walk by. I thought he was talking to someone else at first, but when I made eye contact he was staring at me. Made me consider for a minute whether to stop donating, but I decided that one asshole isn't going to get in the way of me trying to be helpful to others.

There, I bragged. And now I feel dirty.

"**Transportation: Motorbike (Living without a car)**

(a lot of this is applicable to having just a scooter or a moped)

Buying &amp; Training:

* Utility is going to be more favourable than looks or power. 250cc-650cc engine is ideal as a daily commuter, grocery/misc runner. [Dual sports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-sport_motorcycle) tend to be more rugged and are easier to modify to add side-cases or a rack for hauling stuff around. Craigslist used ranges: $1000 (may need some work) — $4500 (turn-key and probably includes all of the above).

* [Evergreen Cycle Training](http://evergreenmotorcycletraining.org/) is MSF-certified, and has classes just about any day of the week (afternoon/evenings too). Typical class is one-two days theory and two days practice on a range. Your last day is in-class exam with endorsement issued immediately. Great way to try out which particular type of bike might work best for you.

Gear:

* Quality gear will be most important. Preferably something that is 4-season/waterproof such as Goretex, typically Cordura and such (although water-resistant leathers exist).

* Being a temperate climate, it does not get too cold or too hot here most of the time (there are some single-digit day exceptions). I have a pair of glove liners and base layers for winter. Heated vest/pants/gloves/boot liners if I'm going over the mountain passes.

* Gear guide: [part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/motorcycles/comments/rtqsd/motorcycle_gear_guide_for_beginning_riders_part_1/), [part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/motorcycles/comments/rtreu/motorcycle_gear_guide_for_beginning_riders_part_22/)

* High-vis! A tacky-looking bike and rider is much more visible on a typical gloomy Seattle day than an all-black/grey.

Seattle/WA specifics:

* Wet paint is slippery. Take it easy on the corners with crosswalks, et al. when it's wet

* Although lane-splitting/filtering is not legalized in WA (yet), it's more [logical and safer](http://www.ots.ca.gov/pdf/publications/2014mclanesplittingsurvey.pdf) to do so. Alleviates stress caused by today's Seattle traffic and gets you off the roads sooner on your way. This is a very debated topic.

* Motorbikes get priority ferry boarding much like bicycles. Some ferries may require ferry reservation for automobile traffic, but not bikes, and WSDOT will let you skip the line.

* Insurance is not required, although it already came in handy for me (theft and minor damages).

* Free HOV/HOT lane access!

* RPZ parking is free. There are streets with RPZ parking only on one side though, so be sure to check the signs.

* Get a lockable cover if you plan on leaving your bike outside for a while and tether it via a sturdy chain to a nearby pole or similar immovable object. Seattle has a city-wide issue with property theft. [Ex-thief AMA has much more useful advice](https://www.reddit.com/r/motorcycles/comments/t5shp/ex_thief_chopshop_operator_ama/).

* Watch out for druggies stealing spark plugs for crack pipes.

Maintenance:

* Slightly more difficult than a bicycle, but much easier than a car.

* I did most of my maintenance in the street when I was living in an apartment. (This includes oil changes, chain cleaning, etc.).

* A good metric socket set and a torque wrench and a maintenance manual (search online for free pdfs) is about all you need.


Economics:

* Avg. MPG: 50 (some people push even further)

* Avg. fillup cost: ~$30 monthly

* Avg. cost per mile: $0.07-$0.10

* DIY oil change: $50 every 6 months (depends on mileage of course)

Car-free here since 2013. Zip-car/car2go work in a pinch and most stuff can be delivered.

"Right now, Amazon's talent strategy is more or less working for them. They're growing fast, their stock price is up, shareholders are happy. An article like this is unlikely to spur major reforms. 

The strategy is working (in a sense) because Amazon is able to find enough talented and hardworking people to hit all their goals. People put up with Amazon's shit for a number of reasons, but one huge one is the stock price growth. If the price keeps appreciating, pay is actually very competitive for the amount of work people are putting in and the shit they deal with. Outside of tech, there are plenty of industries that offer excellent comp but at a soul-sucking price. Investment banking and private equity come to mind. People work 100 hr weeks because the pay is great. Shitty boss? Whatever, as long as I can buy that new beach house in a couple years. This is the Wall St culture. 

Here's where the Amazon model could finally break down. At some point, some day, shareholders will finally demand profits. After 20 years, they've been remarkably patient. Once they demand this, the proverbial party will be over. The company will have to reduce the size of stock outlays and the share price will drop dramatically. Guess what, now that your stock payout is 50% of what you were expecting, your tolerance for Amazon mind games is gone. Fuck this shit. Suddenly their attrition issue actually becomes a problem. You could see a slippery slope effect where employees who have held out for awhile start leaving in droves and the company's fortunes are worsened because they don't have he staff to drive their growth.

"&gt;The revenue would be used for gun safety research and gun violence prevention programs.

Translation: ""The revenue will keep employed individuals who make their livings off of pushing an anti-gun agenda.""

&gt;""City government can and must pursue innovative gun safety measures that save lives and save money""

Then with all of the money going into the anti-gun movement across the country, why do you turn around and scream that gun violence is on the rise? If you look at the numbers, it's almost as if the money pumped into anti-gun bulls** is actually *fueling* gun violence. But that's none of my business. (Hint: Google the keywords ""Fast and Furious"" and ""Garland Shooter"" together)

&gt;Between 2006 and 2010, there were on average 131 firearms deaths a year in King County, according to Public Health-Seattle and King County. An additional 536 people required hospitalization for shooting injuries during that time.

How many of those injuries and deaths involved lawfully purchased firearms? As well, how many of these deaths and injuries occurred within Seattle city limits, the boundary which the tax would supposed to be benefiting?

&gt;According to Burgess, the direct medical costs of treating 253 gunshot victims at Harborview Medical Center in 2014 totaled more than $17 million.

Wait I thought the tax was going to gun violence research and gun violence prevention programs. It's going to pay medical bills now, too?

This tax is going to just force law abiding citizens to enable criminals to continue being criminals. I'm not upset over a $25 tax on a $500+ firearm, or a few cents more per bullet; rather, it's the whole agenda and logic behind the taxes, along with where the money is going. Besides - you think any of these yuckos want gun violence in America to stop? The anti-gun industry is thriving, and they *need* gun violence to continue making a living. They want you, the average American, to feel extreme emotions so that you throw all of the money you can at them. They want more Newtowns. They want more Charlsetons. They want more sob stories to hit the front page. They want your money. They don't want it to go anywhere, because otherwise they'd have to think of a different reason to stamp $25 more on a gun and a few cents on every bullet, and any other reason wouldn't hold any weight; and for all we know, $25 on every gun sold is keeping crooks like Burgess employed.",false,false,t1_ctyvqrj,EINARR_THE_BERSERKER,,0,1439272412,t5_2qhad,t3_3gjyv6,t3_3gjyv6,24,1440408740,0,0,ctyvqrj,Seattle,24,,

"There are good and bad parts in working at Amazon, for me the bad vastly outweighed the good, for other people in other groups things may be better, it's a big company with lots of different areas.

But the overarching corporate culture and values are, in my view, hugely problematic and the cause of a lot of the poor working conditions. One of the problems that's difficult to get past is that the causes of poor working conditions at a knowledge worker job can be complicated and difficult to explain because of the complexity involved, it's not as simple as ""the mine is unsafe"" or ""the warehouse is too hot"". Most jobs at Amazon won't involve working more than 40 hours a week but that doesn't magically result in a good environment, it just means they aren't as bad as, say, EA.

Two of the biggest problems are baked into Amazon's internal corporate values: frugality and hustle. For example, everyone at Amazon has a desk that's made out of a door. These desks aren't very great (mine always leaked sap out of the legs), but they're also ironically more expensive than a regular desk. Which shows the degree to which Amazon follows policies and traditions that seem naively good on the surface without taking the time to seriously evaluate them or open up a company-wide dialogue on them. It's a cargo-cult mentality. And because these things come down from Bezos they are almost impossible to challenge or to change internally. Every developer ends up with an under-powered workstation and tiny monitors, irrespective of the impact that good equipment and good tools has on productivity. Second, Amazon makes a great show of valuing ""hustle"", which means that people get more credit for busywork than for good work, though the real-world value is exactly the opposite. Good developers don't just churn out tons of code, they execute on difficult projects and they get the right thing done.

It's no wonder then that Amazon tends to churn through junior devs while experienced devs find a home elsewhere, where they are wanted, supported, and rewarded.

Another big problem is being on call. Again, like so much at Amazon it seems like a good idea on the surface. If you have to support your own code then you will better understand the impact of what you do in the future and you'll be more incentivized to write the most robust code possible. Plus, it's frugal. In practice none of this is true. Because people cycle through Amazon at a rapid pace the code you support is never your own or even that of your team, it's code that was written N-generations ago by people who have been replaced several times over. But you never have the time or resources to actually fix up the messes that others made before you, because there's always something else that's higher priority that has to get done. So instead of this perfect world where you support your own code that just gets better and better over time you end up with an extra part-time job of supporting someone else's shitty code that you will never be able to completely fix, and then after a year or two you move on to a different team or company and someone else has to support whatever you did while you were around, just adding to the problem. As anyone who's been around for any length of time in this industry knows, being saddled with all the responsibility for something breaking and none of the power to actually fix it is one of the shittiest situations to be in and a huge source of stress.

All of this complements the rest to form a big ol' hairball of horribleness. No matter who you are or what your level of talent and skill is you'll be treated like a junior dev. You'll have your productivity micro-managed and critiqued based on how much busywork you can pump out, regardless of quality. You'll have enjoyment of your free time sucked away by being on call, which will invariably lead to being paged (unless you are supremely lucky) and interrupting whatever you were doing (going to the movies? going on a date? out at a restaurant? doesn't matter) to put in a few extra hours of work in emergency mode. And then you'll come back into work to sit at your door-desk in front of your tiny monitors in your boring grey cube and wonder if it's all worth it or if maybe you'd be better off somewhere else.

As to /u/pivolover 's questions regarding box blocking, let me first say that this is a high-priority issue for us that requires a great deal of planning to not make the problem worse. We're [launching a big initiative](http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/transportation/seattle-to-crack-down-on-its-jammed-up-intersections/) in the Fall to address a number of the issues clogging up the SLU/north downtown core, including box blocking. We're also looking at ways to improve enforcement in transit and bike lanes. More on that to come!

As far as photos go, officers must witness a violation in order to stop, identify and cite a driver. A picture will not suffice, unfortunately.
And while we understand it can be frustrating and even dangerous to have to navigate around vehicles illegally stopped in a crosswalk, responding by committing criminal property damage is not recommended.

"It might help if you told us some specifics about this mythic ""best pizza"" you're trying to match--shape, crust, sauce, cheeses, toppings, baking method, etc. East coast narrows it down some, but New York style is different from New Haven style, which is not the same as New England Greek, which differs from a Trenton tomato pie, which is distinct from the Philadelphia tomato pie, and none of those are much like a true Neapolitan, or a Sicilian, or a Roman...

Not that you're likely to find perfect replicas of any of those here.  Seattle doesn't have a dominant pizza style, or a lot of great examples of any other regional variations. What you find most here tends to be either California-esque (individual pies, thin, crispy crust, exotic toppings that drive the purists crazy), or Neapolitan-influenced (wood-fired ovens, minimalist dough, San Marzano tomatoes, fresh mozzarella, and a short list of toppings), or sort of Greek (chewy, puffy crust with lots of olive oil, a blend of cheeses that often includes cheddar, lots of sauce with lots of oregano), plus a lot of middle-of-the-road pies that don't really resemble any distinctive style.

A lot of people complain there's no truly great pizza in Seattle, but what that usually means is they haven't found a place that does it like their favorite place somewhere else.  Most everybody imprinted at some point on one style, or one pizza joint, that they loved, and that's become The Best Pizza, period, in their minds--the standard by which all others are judged. But my Platonic ideal of pizza may not be anything like yours, and we may both be SOL for finding anything like them here.

"The Constitution doesn't apply to private businesses. It's the same reason that a store, like Starbucks, can prohibit you from carrying.

Anyway, here's a thought experiment: you're a legislator, and you want to ban something, but the Constitution (or whatever law of the land) prevents you from doing so. So, instead, you do as [Chris Rock jokingly suggests](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZrFVtmRXrw) and create a one hundred million dollar tax on that thing.

Why is that tax there? Well, of course, the legislator isn't looking to actually increase tax revenue. He or she is looking to ban the item and simply found a roundabout way to accomplish it. This can be seen as a de facto ban: it's not explicitly a ban, but it accomplishes as much (and was intended to do so).

In most cases, the tax is not nearly as egregious, but the value above is just to illustrate clearly that this is possible. Most often, legislators will pick something seemingly innocuous (to try and avoid prohibitions on de facto bans), but enough of a burden to force businesses to close or relocate. This is what they're arguing here: that a tax of this size is enough to make it nearly impossible for stores in Seattle to compete with those outside of the city, forcing their closure (and effectively banning them).

Quick edit: An example of this in practice is what some localities here in Washington have tried to do with recreational marijuana. They can't ban it and usurp state law, so they create guidelines for where these businesses may be located that, in practice, make it impossible for them to operate there.",false,false,t1_cuen041,nexted,,0,1440468962,t5_2qhad,t3_3i8kn5,t1_cuemcam,13,1441452991,0,0,cuen041,Seattle,13,,

This year it was coupled with our extremely dry winter and spring.

On private lands (owned by the big lumber companies,) foresters actively clear brush and down trees, and rarely have issues with fires. 

I've said it before, and I'll say it again, but I think this years fire season is going to tip the scales in allowing fire science and forestry to start controlled burns on public lands in the wet months to clear out brush and debris that have accumulated over the past couple of years.

"The whole thing was bizarre and seemed like even the protestor weren't sure what they were doing. I am and will always be with #blacklivesmatter but was left with some serious questions after interacting with a few of the protestors. 

I was up near the front with the banner wavers. There was actually heckling of the protestors before we knew they were protestors. Some of the protestors (including a *very* large woman) pushed some of the elderly aside to get in the very front of the crowd. They went up to the front rail which blocked the view of some of the very frail and disabled who were obviously very eager and just wanted to see the speakers. People called out to these two women to try to shame them to move (we thought they were just crazy to see Bernie). 

When they unfurled the flag and shit started going down, one woman panicked and tried to get her child in a wheelchair out of the area very quickly. Protestor in baseball cap actually laughed at her panic (so much for compassion). 

From what I saw of the two main protesting women, they almost seemed disappointed that Bernie wasn't going to speak or try to speak. I'm not sure what the hell they thought was going to happen, as they had already jerked the crowd around at that point. Everyone was extremely hot and tired, 1/2 the crowd was 55+ and in walkers, and had waited for two hours to see Bernie speak. I almost think that something either didn't go to plan, or that they didn't actually have a plan at all. They seemed perplexed when speaking with other speaker WOC at the rally. 

My interaction with one of the male protestors in the baseball cap during the end was just really weird. He kept repeating ""Actually I'm a Republican"" as a totally nonsensical answer to questions like ""Why would you do this at a Sanders rally?"" When I asked if they knew they would be blocking the elderly he said he ""wished we had got here earlier."" Given the time frame I saw them push through the crowd, I almost think that MAYBE they missed half of the actual rally (Like the NAACP black lives matter speech, or the little boy speaking about the effect SS has on families of color). 

Most of the crowd confusion came from the fact that probably 3/4 of the rally was about the effect that Medicare/Medicaid/Social Security had on people of color, as well as directly addressing #blacklivesmatter.

"Sure! Rachel Lake is my favorite. It's out of the ways enough that it's not completely overrun with people. It's also got a killer elevation gain at the end, and it's not just on a trail. You're going over tree roots, rocks, through (low) creeks, and next to waterfalls. It's not *hard*, but it's not just a walk in the woods either. And the lake at the end is just spectacular. There are camping spots up there as well. You can also continue on to Rampart and Lila Lakes, as well as Alta Peak from there. 

Also love Heather Lake. It's right before Lake 22 (which is nice in it's own right). It's somewhat similar in terms of the ground you're walking on - not just a mulched trail. Though, being that it's right next to Lake 22, it's a lot busier, especially on weekends. Pretty short, so it makes for a nice half day hike. 

Goat Lake is a great day hike, pretty easy, but long. Much further than Lake 22 or Heather Lake so also a bit quieter. I remember the road getting there was AWFUL though. It's about 10.5mi round trip I think? 

At Rainier, Burroughs Mountain Trail. Just be aware if you have problems at high elevations (like me!), and go slow. We took the Sunrise Loop trail back to the lot and it was a good way to see a lot of different sights - and bears. 

If you decide to go to Mt. St. Helens, for the love of baby jesus, bring a hat, 100 bottles of sunscreen, and 200 bottles of water. We did Harry's Ridge last year on what ended up being the hottest day of the year, and I hated it. I was also very noticeably dehydrated, even though we had a 3L bladder filled to capacity, and two giant water bottles. The problem is there is NO shade anywhere. So if it's sunny, you're going to be in it the entire time. I think my thing about not really like it was it was also the same view the entire time. You were always facing the mountain, and everything around you is just dead and desolate. It's really amazing to see in person, but I don't have a desire to walk around it. 

Rattlesnake is the obvious if you have people in town and want to impress them with good views on a relatively short and easy hike. Just get there really early unless you want to be part of the line walking up it.

"&gt;I literally see about 10 people on articulated buses. 

Except for rush hour. This is the problem with encouraging growth, providing access from an equity perspective, and basic rush hour issues. Transit almost *never* pays for itself outside of rush hour trips. On any route.

&gt;This year I see TWO articulated buses arrive at stops within a minute of each other

[This](http://www.citymetric.com/transport/why-do-three-buses-always-come-along-once-game-explains-1141) is why that happens. 

&gt;Why do we get these huge buses on inconvenient routes? 

Usually it's fleet management. In most cases where you can't understand why we don't see better buses or ""inappropriate"" ones, it's because of where the bus has to leave from and go to for service, based on what facilities are located where. It's costly to drive a bus far from its last stop to  base, and worsens traffic. And each base is limited in both size and kind of maintenance that can be handled. 

&gt;We have technology, where's the studies and algorithms?

There there, you just have to talk to metro.

Back on track: A Moses letter is a official memo sent out to staff of a federal agency encouraging managers to let their qualified staff go respond to an emergency.  It basically says ""Let my people go"",  hence the nickname. 

The reason Moses letters exist is that while most of the actual firefighters on the line are professional firefighters, most of the administration and support staff (aka Command and General staff) are federal employees with ""normal"" jobs who have volunteered to go work emergencies. This means that in order to staff the emergency response you have to take time away from normal jobs and projects,  something many managers are reluctant to do unless specifically ordered.

"If you are moving here with less than $6,000 and don't have a job, or friends with a couch, then I would advice you to reconsider.

I moved into Wallingford.  2BR / 2BTH.  $5,800 CASH to walk through the door and be handed keys.  That's after proving bank statement of money in the bank, as well as proving monthly income from a guaranteed job.  That's first + last + security deposit + getting all utilities turned on.

That's no furniture, appliances, just windows, walls, doors.

Comcast took 3 weeks to arrive and install cable service.  It would be advisable to upgrade ones cellphone data plan during the move to account for any overages that might happen from gps usage, or it being the only means of data.  

Some weirdos here don't think you need air conditioning.  They are sick or dying, thin blood, cancer, something is wrong with them.  It's already gotten over 94 degrees and that is going to return and will probably sustain.  If you have a window mount AC bring it with you, or a floor mount.  Most or all housing doesn't come with AC here.  So save yourself from having to re-buy it.  My house is brick and on days over 90 degrees it did not cool off ever.  

As someone who walks everyday around the neighborhoods I can tell you when it's hot couples be fighting.  Getting rowdy.  On cool days never hear a peep.  Then you gotta listen to the make up sex.  So bring fans and air condition to avoid all that.  My Tempur-Pedic bed never cooled off until I got AC on those hot days.  It would just radiate heat.  So take your precious sleep into consideration, that was a miserable two weeks.      

To that same effect I hardly ever see any signs on houses if they are for rent.  The best you might see is a realtor lock.  Craigslist apt with the map view is about the best you can use.

If you aren't from the PNW it's sunny as shit here, and it gets daylight at like 4:30am.  Like you are sitting on the beach, with sun glasses on bright.  Freaked me out when I woke up the first morning.

Wallingford / Fremont area is rather expensive to dine out.  

People have mentioned Tutta Bella Pizza:  

For 1 person the average small pizza with 2 cocktails is $32 at non happy hour.  Some bad ass bourbon cocktails.

Roxies BackDoor hit me up for $38 for 1 cocktail and some wings.  

Fried chicken here is ridiculously expensive, and good southern style hasn't been found yet.  The one place I did find that advertised Fried Chicken &amp; Waffles basically served some ridiculous over fried, nuclear hot. tasteless, boneless, mess of a thing they called fried chicken.  Made me sad, that someone would eat that and go.  Man that was great fried chicken, when in fact it could have been the worst I've ever had.  It's sure as shit not anything close to Roscoes Chicken and Waffles in Los Angeles.  Which is still a far cry from real pressure cooked with those original spices.

If you are from So.Cal and like a non WET burrito with carne asada, cheese, sour cream, guac, beans (optional), rice(optional), then I highly recommend this Taqueria in Fremont.  For some reason here the Mexican places, insist on making them wet and nasty.  Tacos Guaymas will come out wrapped in foil, nice and tight packed.  and they mix the ingredients around so you don't get 3 bites of wrap &amp; cheese then the good stuff.  Right from the start you get asada.  

Tacos Guaymas - Salsa is on point, as well as the Horchata.

Seems like the only way to get people to take the bus is to do something like giving them separate lanes. For the most part buses have to sit in the same damn traffic so they aren't that fast. Bus Stop Times become unreliable so more people give up and just start driving. Giving buses more special access can be done fairly cheaply and should clog up other traffic by hogging their own lane making it so people have to ride buses. Major construction projects take much too long. Giving buses priority access seems like the only way we can start to force public transit in the short term.

"""White people don't talk about race because they feel awkward and uncomfortable""

First of all white people do talk about race - just not with black people.  Secondly its not so much about feeling awkward and uncomfortable as being called 'racist' and dealing with the consequences of that.  Honestly, people lose their jobs over voicing their opinion on race in this country.  So no, its not the kind of thing anybody wants to talk about unless they're only amongst close friends.  It isn't the kind of thing that ordinary people can have an open and honest discussion about in a public forum.  If you think that's a cop-out, fine.

"A loaded 18 wheeler gets 6 MPG at best, so takes 1/6 gallon of fuel to move 1 mile.

360 x 1/6 = 60 gallons.
1 gallon of diesel costs $2.66.
60 * 2.66 = $159.60 to move the circus 1 mile. Not that bad actually.

But a major band tour is going to take a lot of miles.

I don't want to check the distances between the 79 tour cities, but the first 4 were like 800km each.
So I assume 79 * 800km = 63,200km / 39,500 miles total. U2 had 360 trucks each doing 1/3 of the job, so same as 120 trucks doing the whole trip.
120 * 39,500 miles = 4,740,000 truck-miles, at 6 MPG this is 790,000 U.S. Gallons (*$2,101,400*) of diesel fuel consumed to move the claw and stuff. A gallon of diesel burned releases 19.64 lbs of CO2, so the trucking fleet for the tour released 15,515,600 lbs, or about 7,760 tons of CO2.

7,760 tons of CO2 would be the amount released by a jetliner circling the globe 11 times, or a bit longer than the distance to the moon.

"There was a lawsuit in the [90s](http://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/13/business/technology-temp-workers-at-microsoft-win-lawsuit.html) about Microsoft hiring people as contractors that should have been regular employees. Because of the lawsuit, Microsoft and many other companies took steps to make sure they weren't treating people hired as contractors the same as people hired as employees, such as not allowing them to go to the company's morale events and parties. After the lawsuit, you started seeing a lot of people talking like [this](http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/04/01/businesspropicks-us-findlaw-dont-treat-c-idUSTRE53063S20090401):

&gt; What's the moral of this story for employers? For starters, it once again shows that merely having a worker sign an agreement that he or she is an IC will not make him or her one in the eyes of the law. Rather, the worker must be treated like an IC on the job. Since the penalties for misclassification can be severe, you must make sure that everyone who deals with ICs in your company understands that they can't be supervised or otherwise controlled in the same way as employees. ICs are independent businesspeople who must be treated as such.

&gt; Misclassifying workers as ICs has always been expensive (if you get caught), but the Vizcaino case can make it even more expensive if your company has generous employment benefit programs such as Microsoft's. It's highly advisable for any company that hires ICs to promptly add provisions to all its employee benefit plans specifically excluding coverage for contingent workers. This includes stock option, vacation, sick leave, health insurance and retirement plans. Had Microsoft done this, it might not have had to provide coverage to its misclassified workers.",false,false,t1_ctstatx,blablahblah,Belltown,0,1438809989,t5_2qhad,t3_3fwqc0,t1_ctst3cm,31,1440303867,0,0,ctstatx,Seattle,31,,flair

we didn't arrest you for quietly being republican in your own home, which is more than could be said for how texans treated gays and lesbians as recently as 1998*.

are you not in prison? i'd say we've won the tolerance argument right there.

edit: just re-read this and saw it in context to my last post yesterday...
instead of it sucking i hope you have an awesome time here, meet new friends, and allow them/us to broaden your political, ethical, and theological horizons.  i hope too you challenge your new friends in much the same way.

"I am going to be that guy and blame the victim, and by that I don't mean what you think I mean. Bernie Sanders has a problem appealing to black people.

Fourth Pic is this building on Melrose (https://www.google.com/maps/@47.620041,-122.32908,3a,75y,112.36h,93.54t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sQydnDrMFP3jirEQA4n9v7A!2e0!7i13312!8i6656)

Fifth Pic is possibly First Ave, between Stewart and Virginia.  I think. (https://www.google.com/maps/@47.610638,-122.341893,3a,90y,247.46h,90.84t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sQgsAw4As-HZFkn7WQdXOlQ!2e0!6s%2F%2Fgeo2.ggpht.com%2Fcbk%3Fpanoid%3DQgsAw4As-HZFkn7WQdXOlQ%26output%3Dthumbnail%26cb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26thumb%3D2%26w%3D100%26h%3D80%26yaw%3D226.23277%26pitch%3D0!7i13312!8i6656)

The last Pic is a negative, and probably an old Issaquah Theatre.  In fact it's the Issaquah Village Theatre (https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=images&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CAcQjRxqFQoTCNvxprXJjccCFYksiAodLfIPuw&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcommons.wikimedia.org%2Fwiki%2FFile%3AIssaquah_-_Village_Theatre_04.jpg&amp;ei=Cbe_VZvJEonZoASt5L_YCw&amp;bvm=bv.99261572,d.cGU&amp;psig=AFQjCNE2NZDNNWZNOkj-lx2F3GAlzO758Q&amp;ust=1438713970918835)  You can even see the vertical Theatre sign in the negative.

Hopefully that helps!!
As i looked through these most of the vantage points can be found with a walk around Cap Hill, UD and Downtown.  I think the First Ave Pic might be from the St. Regis Hotel roof.  So basically someone just wandering around Seattle taking some snapshots.

Yes, it’s called politeness and graciousness. That’s what CANDIDATES typically need to do.

Generally, yes. The “fuck you, we’re America” manner of George W. Bush, as it’s most recent user, was and remains an abject failure. “We’re America, how can we work together?” manner of Obama works far better.

Bernie graciously yielded the mic, and they wildly abused it. What was he supposed to do? Punch them in the back of the head and toss them off of the stage, dragged, kicking and screaming?

- if #BLM partnered with the Bernie campaign they'd probably be able to get a lot more attention and a good possibility, if he happens to get to the presidency,  of action at the federal level to address institutional racism within police forces. It would also force the other candidates to at least address the issue.

&gt; Y'all I am mad.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm so fucking mad. For the billionth time today I've seen white people try to tell black people to quiet down, to stop disrupting. I'm listening to White Seattle shake their heads and lament at how black people are just ""hurting their own cause"" by disrupting Bernie Sanders' event. ""Can't they see he's their best bet?""
&gt; 
&gt; Fuck all of that. Every single bit.
&gt; 
&gt; Since the abolition of slavery we've been told to take it slow. Our entire lives we've had the myth of the begging, pleading MLK shoved down our throats as how the good negro was supposed to act.

It's not like any president has done shit for us anyway. Maybe you dems need to know what it's like when that brown vote you've always counted on was gone. Maybe then you'd listen.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm tired of being taken for granted. I'm tired of being told to ask nicely. I'm tired of turning on the news and seeing another black body in the street. I'm tired of knowing that the black men I know have a 1 in 3 chance of being locked up in the new slavery of our prison systems.

"I worked for Amazon for two years, there are some things I want to comment on.

Your relocation is prorated over two years. So if you got a $10,000 relocation stipend and you leave after 18 months, you will owe $2,500 on the relocation.

Your signing bonus is usually paid out in a lump sum for your first year, and added in 12 installments to each monthly paycheck for the second year. So if you completed your first year, you won't be on the hook for any of the lump sum, and at most for the part of the bonus you got on your most recent monthly paycheck (although I kind of doubt they'd even bother going after you for it).

Anyway, at Amazon, I worked 40 hours a week among generally friendly people. My manager only ever asked me to work on a weekend once, and he felt super awkward and was really apologetic about it.

"My experience living in the African American community is this: 90% are just regular people who want to get by. Maybe 5% are loudmouth, self-appointed ""civil rights"" activists, and another 5% are common criminals, scofflaws and felons.

In situations like Ferguson and Baltimore, the activists are taken advantage of by criminals, who use them as cover. The classic example is [Antonio French](http://www.kmov.com/story/29746241/store-broken-into-near-protest-in-ferguson), a nice guy who wants to help his neighborhood, criticizes the police, and gets beaten up and robbed for his trouble by his own people. Gangsters are not idiots, and understand that civil unrest presents many new opportunities to intimidate law enforcement, rob people who otherwise would not be around (journalists and activists), steal from stores, and settle old scores (shootings). 

I point all this out to just to reinforce the message: most people in Black America are not rioting, looting, protesting, interrupting Bernie Sanders or doing anything else.

"**TRANSPORTATION - PUBLIC**

If you plan on using public transportation you will want to get an Orca card. Orca cards are sold at Sound Transit vending machines. I got my first Orca card in the International District near where the Light Rail is, but there are also vending machines near pretty much any entrance to the transit tunnels in the city (where the light rail and many buses run). The card is $5 at a vending machine but you must load a value onto it.

The most cost effective way to purchase transit fares is by loading a ""Puget Pass"" to your Orca Card. A Puget Pass is a monthly unlimited pass for a certain value of transit transportation.

Some Safeway grocery stores (Currently I know the one in Edmonds on Highway 99 and 196th, Mountlake Terrace/Edmonds on Highway 99, and the Safeway in West Seattle up on California Ave SW all are capable of this, but for some reason the Lower Queen Anne Safeway could not load Puget Passes when I tried two years ago, not sure if they are still unable to) in the area will load a ""Puget Pass"" onto your Orca card.
I have included Puget Pass rates [here.] (http://www.soundtransit.org/Documents/pdf/orca/ORCA%20Product%20List.pdf)

You can also load cash values at Bartell drugs, I believe.

The rates just depend on where you're going and whether you are traveling across counties. For example, inner Seattle tends to be in the $2.75 value during peak hours. However, traveling from Lynnwood (Snohomish County) to Seattle (King County) during peak hours is $4.00. You may want to research the fare on the transit websites.

Depending on where you are in the Puget Sound there are *numerous* transit companies and ways of transportation. Here are the sites below.

[Metro Transit](http://metro.kingcounty.gov/)

[Sound Transit](http://www.soundtransit.org/)

[Community Transit](http://www.communitytransit.org/)

Each of these sites has a trip planner which is very helpful, however, I've found that the App ""OneBusAway"" is invaluable when it comes to public transit. It shows arrival times, routes, stops, everything you could possibly need. It also eases my anxiety when I know where the bus will stop if I haven't ridden that route before.

Also, Orca cards can be used on other forms of Public transportation as well, such as the [Sounder train] (http://www.soundtransit.org/sounder), the [Light Rail](http://www.soundtransit.org/Schedules/Link-light-rail), and the [King County Water Taxi](http://www.kingcounty.gov/transportation/kcdot/WaterTaxi.aspx). Orca cards are really fantastic, if you haven't gotten my drift yet.

"As someone who's lived in LA (born/raised), SF (5 years) and Seattle (2 months) within the past 10 years, my experience has been:

LA:

* Don't move there unless you're comfortable with the idea of driving everywhere.  Public transportation is poor, the freeway system is expansive, there's plenty of stuff to do but it's spread out.
* I would recommend not living anywhere near the beach, downtown LA or Hollywood.  These areas are incredibly expensive.  They have the highest concentration of stuff to do, but if you've already accepted that you'll be driving extensively, move into the suburbs and save yourself the money.  The further inland you go the cheaper stuff tends to get.
* There are plenty of cool people to meet, but you're more than likely going to have to sift through a sea of vapid people to find them.  Like most big cities, LA is a city of transplants, but LA gets transplants who move there to live the LA life they see on TV.

SF:

* SF is INCREDIBLY expensive.  Not only is rent through the roof, but just entertainment is generally expensive.  Most of what San Franciscan's enjoy doing is centered around bars, restaurants and music.
* There is a lot to do outside of SF, but San Franciscan's are generally unwilling to leave the city.  If you want to explore outside the city, make sure you seek out like minded people rather than trying to convince stubborn homebodies.

Seattle:

* Don't move here if you don't like outdoor activities.  You will probably end up bored before long.
* As long as you love Seattle/WA, it's the most realistic of the 3 cities to own a home in.",false,false,t1_cumesyk,jigglawr,Fremont,0,1441063419,t5_2qhad,t3_3j3fzd,t3_3j3fzd,10,1441616084,0,0,cumesyk,Seattle,10,,flair

"As someone who has watched the person she loves work 80+ hour work weeks for years, weekends, holidays, on call, leave in the middle of a day off during dinner... It's tough on a family and heartbreaking to see someone you love so deeply be worked to the bone.

 When people start a job you know there might be a bit more asked of you then your last job, you know you have to stand out and put some effort out there to show the bosses you were the right hire. I get that, most wives and husbands of tech folk know the cost of such. But weeks should be a common thing, not months or years. People work so damn hard in tech, most at least, there are some horrible and lazy people don't get me wrong, but to set a bar so high and expect 70+ hour work weeks is nuts and inhumane. Some of the places my husband has worked boast how they care about family, granted this was on the other side of the country,  but those were the worst. The ones who forced him in on weekends, birthdays, when I was sick and could barely move, and one even told him he ""Had"" to come in the day after our son died because it was dire and absolutely had to get work done. 

When a company tells you to come in and work a 14hr work day after your child died, there is a problem. This was 14yrs ago but I still have that bitter feeling I'll never let go and neither will my husband. Point is tech is one industry that is pretty much a work or your're fired field, do as we say or walk, like being poor and homeless, don't come in and you will be. I wish there was some Union, or some body of people to keep programmers, engineers, and everyone in between able to keep their job without going insane, and actually cared for the well being and mental health of its workers in the industry. Set a better bar for a company to follow perhaps. I've seen people break, walk away from tech and live a life on half the money they used to make, it sucks for them in some ways, but they seem much happier they are not being at jobs forcing them under a ""you're fired if you don't..."" umbrella.

Sorry if this is somewhat rambling and here and there, but to read about another person forced to work insane hours and eat, or grasp what sanity they have and be a pauper, it really hits home.

"I wonder if the density of younger engineers at Amazon contributes to this? Specifically, managers haven't seen enough people burn out to know when someone is doing it to themselves?

I haven't worked there but I have worked at a few other tech companies. At my first job I worked 16 hours a day, 7 days a week for 3 months at the end of a project. It wasn't something mandated - it was just 'what everyone else was doing' because we all had way too much to do and too little time. It was a small company so we all felt personally accountable. We were all young, single, no kids, etc so it was 'possible' for us to do it without immediately messing ourselves up but I think it took everyone a month or two afterwards to decompress and get back to a more normal state.

A few years later, towards the end of a project at another company, I found myself again again in crunch trying to finish a project. That time it was 8 months of 65-70 hour weeks (weekdays + Sunday). This time though it was an edict from the producer that everyone needed to be there working that time, etc. Part way through people asked for a two day weekend and offered to work through the next weekend instead. Everyone was already edgy but it was shocking how much that 13 day stretch messed up people. 

That was the last terrible crunch for most of the people I worked with at that company. Leadership learned to handle it better and managers became more proactive about making people go home who were putting in too many hours on their own accord. 

Thats one of the big risks in the industry really - some managers don't realize how much individuals feel accountable and want to make things right. Some hires, particularly younger ones, will absolutely kill themselves putting in hours to fix things. Bad managers take advantage of that and let people burn out. Good managers watch for people overworking and kick them out of the office. And that goes up the chain; someone may need to kick managers out of the office if they're at risk for burnout as well.",false,false,t1_cuc9idu,EnergyCoast,,0,1440285604,t5_2qhad,t3_3i0lrc,t3_3i0lrc,24,1441412105,0,0,cuc9idu,Seattle,24,,

We actually did have a follow-the-sun support team in Dublin. In Seattle you'd be oncall from 10am-10pm, then hand off to Dublin for the other 12 hours, which was 6am-6pm their time.

Run 3 copies of everything, in 3 different datacenters, and continue functioning as long as 2 of the 3 are online. In theory, this allows you to survive an individual machine failing, or even a whole datacenter being struck by a meteor.

In practice, most of our sev2s happened because an individual service would get confused or stuck in some state, drop out of the quorum group, and page the oncall. Typically what the oncall would do is restart that service, verify it rejoined its neighbors, then resolve the ticket. There was little or no effort put in to root-causing why the issue happened in the first place, so that the bug could be fixed or the service could be made to automatically recover.

"&gt;It has nothing to do with Black Lives Matter and everything to do with self-righteous assholes.

It has everything to do with Black Lives Matter. Bernie Sanders marching in the 60s has *nothing* to do with how [he responds to race-based issues](http://www.thenation.com/article/bernie-sanders-blew-a-huge-opportunity-at-netroots-nation/) today. 

&gt;I'm sorry, what the fuck has Bernie Sanders ever done to you, personally? 

I'm sure nothing. He's done nothing. And that's the point. There is a sad trend in places like Seattle, where the only racism we see is the obvious southern Senator spitting racial stereotypes, or barely coded anti-mexican Trump-like border wall rhetoric. We refuse to do more than nod at rebuffs of individual racist dialogue. We pat ourselves on the back, and shout ""I'm an ally! Trust me! I don't hate!"" What, exactly, do we do with our daily lives besides tell ourselves we ""don't hate""? Is that what's going to fix the insane disparities our black and brown friends face when they spend their childhoods surrounded by violence, not making it to college because they are spending their days trying not to get shot? Their families, for generations, have had less access to healthcare, higher education, and basic living needs. Less money for higher education for their children. Less education themselves. There is no doubt this is cyclical, generational, and systemic. It's not laziness. It's not ""cultural"". These are just excuses for why you and I have no responsibility.

There just isn't enough happening. We had to wait until the Feds came and told us we had to change our policing. Seattle isn't acting, we're just pretending like we've solved everything by ignoring the problems, occasionally voicing our ""ally"" position on reddit.

Bernie represents that right now, because he's been silent on race as a primary mover of problems. He is the perfect colorblind candidate, and gaining momentum. As Joe Dinkin states in the article I linked above, 

&gt;""I care about Sanders’s candidacy because I deeply believe in the need for a strong political left in America. So do the Black Lives Matter activists—and they are rightly demanding not to be written out of it. Sanders represents a kind of left-wing-of-the-possible in American politics; if he can’t even earnestly address the mind-bendingly huge number of black people killed by police and in police custody, then that means the issue is off the table in mainstream politics.""

We have to hear that story, that we as white privileged Seattlites are not doing enough, and not get anrgy. We need to recognize that we need to do more than argue on reddit. We need to push our candidates to tackle the huge issues on race, even if we are the ones sitting in the first class seats. We need to be willing to pay more of our taxes to lift up the worse off. And we need to *demand* more from our governments, business, friends and families. We need to reject bad politicians, and *silent* politicians if they refuse to meet our expectations. That is what we *should* be doing. Instead, we're looking the other way. Because we're not black, are we? 

It takes real work to get us all to a better place, and we should recognize that we have a responsibility through our own inaction. We shouldn't be mad when people see that in us, we should own it, and fix it.

**Edit**: I'm awaiting the downvoters' rebuttal. I get why it's difficult, but I hope we can look at ourselves with a bit more measured, introspective effort.

"Costco IT worker here

This is really an apples to oranges comparison. Yes both companies are 'retailers', one in a more traditional sense of the word than the other but they both sell shit. The big difference really is what both of them are aiming for and what their core competencies are in. 

Costco at the end of the day aims to just sell as much shit as they can have their buyers get ahold of (and hot dogs), at the lowest price possible, in bulk (value) to its members. All while providing a positive member and warehouse experience which in-turn establishes and retains member loyalty to the brand. They're not really very interested in technology, in a lot of ways (corporate) is stuck in old ways of doing things, which has admittedly worked really well, but doesn't harbor innovation. The Information Services division of costco is repeatedly told that we are there 'to support the business/warehouses' and that's about it. The core of the business is driven by IBM AS/400's, which runs everything from programs written in RPG, an archaic language from the 80's. A lot of old retailers from the 80's still rely on AS400 backends and its really not all that uncommon, even nowadays. In the 90's, the AS400 was one of, if not the most popular business computer system in the world. So its unfair to say they are backwards by any means to still rely on the AS400, but it is somewhat indicative on where they are technologically. There is a 'modernization' effort underway, but that is very slow and has proved difficult thus far, but making progress. Costco also has a problem retaining talent because of the culture and attitude toward IT. Costco also has a generational problem and an issue attracting young people to pay for memberships. To give you an idea of how bad this is, take a look at costco's facebook page. Also, corporate communications hasn't even set up a verified twitter account (they have an account, its just not verified). It also has 0 posts on our twitter feed. This is something they've largely relied on brand loyalty and word of mouth marketing (such as this article/discussion) to remedy. Also, while Costco's warehouse experience (their bread and butter) is top notch and is what everyone remembers them for, their online experience is pretty basic. It offers no real special benefits than what any other brick and motor retail stores' online presence offers (to be fair, i think its like 5% off non-members for shopping online, nothing really special).

Amazon on the other hand, was built as an online retailer but is slowly becoming an innovator and major player in the technology field. They, as other people have mentioned, have built out a logistics network and almost run their retail operation as a secondary business. Amazon has created a name for itself in many different sectors outside of retail. From AWS to their research on commercial drone use, they are really doing some pretty exciting stuff.

"i think its too early to tell because so many factors can change, but if everything remains, I give S. by the end of the vote count in a week or whattever, I'd imagine that Sawant's total percentage of the vote will actually increase to around 53-55%. Which will mean, slightly less percentage for the other candidates. I base this on last years city council run, when the first ballot drop only revealed 46.5% Sawant, but as the late votes were counted over the week, the late votes favored Sawant. That is based on the fact that early voters are generally older/affluent/conservative and late votes are generally the opposite - which is Sawant's base.

That being said, I'd imagine that all the sorts of donors, voters, and people who were working on Hearne's campaign will shift toward Pam Banks in the General Election in 4 months.

4 months is a lot of time for public opinion to shift. I think the odds of Sawant keeping her seat will increase if she is able to accomplish anything more on housing affordability (which may just be difficult with the current city council). Will her message resonate with people enough to inspire them to vote for her again? Odds may go down if the subtle smear and FUD campaigns ramp up. I still hear weird rumors perpetuated by the rightwingers on /r/seattle about lies on Kshama that just are not true. If this sort of FUD can increase, it will confuse voters and Sawant supporters, and that can have an affect. Which is why the FUD will continue. Oh yeah, and while some money will be pro-Banks adverts, wait until the PACs get involved and we see strictly anti-Sawant adverts.

It was already an expensive election race, and I expect that more money will come in. Pam Banks has a lot of big money support from all around the country, and now that the race is down to two, I think its safe to assume more corporate donations will come in. Sawant can only counter that by keeping up the street game, which already has been pretty impressive. 

Finally, voters in primaries are generally older/affluent/conservative. This could mean that Sawant's base will turn out to vote in the general election. If all momentum stays the way it is now, at this point I wouldn't be surprised to see in November Sawant: 55%, Banks 45%.",false,false,t1_ctsmxlm,cancercures,Capitol Hill,0,1438801252,t5_2qhad,t3_3fvtpv,t1_ctsg40k,10,1440300866,0,0,ctsmxlm,Seattle,10,,flair

"Man, these police union guys just don't get it. We've had decades of alleged police mistreatment of minorities in this country. Thanks to the proliferation of cameras, we have now seen dozens of police shootings of unarmed citizens in the last few years nationwide. Suddenly, decades of alleged mistreatment became obvious to all. Only recently have these guys been charged with actual crimes. To see some of these guys do things like place weapons near the suspect after they shot them or state in their report that the suspect was running at them when video clearly shows them running away is appalling. You have to wonder, just how long has this been going on and how prevalent was it?

The police have lost the trust of the general public and the only way to gain it back is to start firing the guys who abuse their position of power and jail the guys who commit murder. It is no longer ""protect and serve"" and is instead an ""us vs. them"" situation, which this union president clearly states. Sadly, the union is always there to defend the worst of the worst. Stop killing innocent people, then we can talk about this ""war on cops.""

It's simple: stop violating the constitution and stop shooting/beating people at the first hint of danger.  Police work was and never will be 100% safe (even though it isn't even in the top 10 of job fatalities per capita). If you are too scared to go out and do that job with full body armor and a gun, maybe you just aren't cut out for it. Stop arming these guys like they are going into Fallujah and teach them how to deescalate situations. So often, their training is ""pull out your gun!"" and they don't seem to get that people tend to do stupid things when a guy is pointing a gun at them and screaming orders. Often times, keeping the gun at your side and talking calmly can defuse tense situations. A small bit of constitutional law couldn't hurt either (""You mean I can't just pull him over because he was black?""). Embrace the use of body cameras. Several cities have shown them to significantly reduce the number of police brutality cases and they also found the civilians as well as the cops behave better when both know they are being recorded.

Clearly, not all cops are bad. But a veil has been lifted in the past few years.

No, this is the result of assholes who think they are more important than everyone else. This isn't about race, it's about assholes being assholes. It has nothing to do with Black Lives Matter and everything to do with self-righteous assholes.

&gt; 2) When the disruption first happened, the crowd (mostly white) turned ugly. It's hard to say what is the chicken or the egg. Some of it may have stemmed from the protestors calling the whole crowd racist. Some of it was from annoyance at the disruption. Some was probably from deep disagreement about tactics in a movement to get attention to an issue. Some was from deep disappointment because people had stood in the hot sun for hours to hear Bernie. Whatever it was, the conversations that ensued

Literally names several reasons for the crowd to be pissed still seems to argue that the assholes that interrupted the speech were only *equally*  (as opposed to entirely) at fault. The writer strawman's about two afraid girls. Last I checked noone actually said anything scary -- more like: ""get off stage"" and that was after Bernie had already let them have their say.

&gt; although I **was** incredibly excited about his candidacy

This paragraph goes on to talk about how Bernie might be a good candidate. But it frames the premise that he was a good candidate and now he might be but that the writer thinks less of him because he was interrupted (implied)?

"As someone who's a minority, I could somewhat sympathize with those people who interrupted Bernie Sanders as I understand if one tries to speak up against racial injustice and everyone else is rudely telling them to shut up (not in this case with Bernie Sanders), it aggravates the people voicing out against racism since for one, nobody's going to hear about the injustice if they didn't voice their opinions and would downplay such an egregious act of racism as it would seem society oppresses and doesn't care about the injustices about minorities; and two, it would have come off for the people telling them to shut as if they would seem like indirect supporters of racists. I'm only saying these things in order to better understand the psychological mindset of these individuals; not to justify their actions.

Edit: 
Preface: I am a nerd. I am typing this on a table that has all of my miniatures, on a gaming laptop that is one of three gaming PCs in my house. I regularly play D&amp;D, and have a shelf of board and tabletop games. 

When I first bought my kilt, it was just an atypical garment. Functional, comfortable, and it raised the right kinds of eyebrows with the ladies. I was younger, and going for a bit of an stick-it-to-the-man look. I thought, maybe, this evokes punk imagery of very deliberately not giving a fuck. It was downright rare to see, and it opened up some really interesting conversations with strangers. I could fit a sixpack of craft beers in the pockets (though I didn't drink at the time). 

However, over time, they've been incorporated into nerd fashion, along with the duster and the fedora, in a way that don't find particularly flattering. What once was a symbol of 'fuck the system', has become more of a ""m'lday"" in my mind. 

To be 100% clear, I don't have any objections to people wearing them -- more power to them -- however, personally, they've been adopted by a fashion culture that I don't relate to.

"Well, since we were there from Thursday (arriving Wednesday night) through Sunday night, we thought it'd be a good idea to begin with exploring the city while everyone was at work and venture further out in the weekend.  We opted to use public transport Thursday and Friday, and rent a car for Saturday and Sunday (perfect since we needed something to carry our bags after we checked out of the hotel).

This is going to be lengthy but I wanted to do your question justice.  This sub helped me a lot, so I like to think of this as my contribution that will help someone else.  Almost everything was an idea I picked up from here.  

Our hotel was near the airport and had a free, 24-hour shuttle.  So we hopped onto the Link Light Rail, enjoyed our first view of the city and stadiums, then got off on Chinatown District where I fell in love with the city from the moment I saw the architecture.  We stumbled upon a park nearby that had a firefighters monument, ping pong tables, a foosball table, and dozens and dozens of tables with chairs.  And nothing was nailed down, or vandalized.  It was beautiful.

After some pong, we went to Columbia tower to go to the Starbucks on the 40th floor and have a pleasant view with some coffee (at this point, pointing out ""Hey, finally a Starbucks"" became a running joke after seeing one on the 40th floor, the bottom floor, and just across the corner from the street).  We went towards the pier where there was a strange gift shop, the ferris wheel, and the aquarium.  We got a ticket for the aquarium and just geeked out talking to all the bright kids about all the fish.  I touched a starfish.  After doing that, we made our way to Pike's Market and saw the front of the first Starbucks.  

We ate at Matt's Market (good beer, and I delighted in the Catfish sandwich while my girlfriend loved her BBQ pulled pork sandwhich).  We continued drinking at Pike's Brewery, then walked through the back and discovered the Gum Wall (you have to go down the stairs next to the bathroom).  From there, we walked -- that's going to be a theme by the way, we did a lot of walking -- to the monorail that took us under the Space Needle and into EMP park.  We did the museum and got to see the temporary Star Wars exhibit.  Spending too much time in the Nirvana section, we rushed through the others and they were all great.  I'd definitely recommend it.

By this time it got dark so we walked to the Local 360 for a cocktail and some lamb to end the day.

The next morning we took the train to the SeaFair, drank some free Rockstars, and talked to another group of brights kids about how they built their robots.  We found a beer garden along the lake and watched about an hour of the show - it was my first air show ever and I was impressed.  Then we took the train to Pioneer station and enjoyed a Philly cheesesteak at Tatt's Delicatessen.  We drank at a few bars called Altstadt Bierhalle &amp; Brathaus and Fado Irish Pub (great salmon bite).  We took a Uber to the Fremont troll and was finally dropped off at the Henry Art Gallery.  The guy waved us in for free and while it was small, I had an absolutely great experience going through the ""Half the Air In a Given Space"" exhibit.  It's a huge room filled with silver balloons up to probably 11 feet high and you get to go through it!  We submerged ourselves in it, got lost for a little while, and then used the walls to guide ourselves out.  Everyone should do this once.

I couldn't believe how gorgeous the University of Washington was.  I wanted to see the Suzzallo library, but it was closed.  So we went South to Pacific Street and walked to Gastown park for the New Belgium Beer outdoor short film festival.  By the way, speaking as a 'Cane, the direct view of Mount Rainier from the University made me envious.  The film festival was cool, but I will be pissed for a long time that I didn't whip out my camera to take a picture of the screen that had a shot of the moon while the moon was directly above it.  Goddamn it, I'm getting bitter just thinking about it.  I saw someone take a picture, so I hope they post it where I can find it.  

Afterwards, we walked up a hill and sat on a bench to look at the city.  Breathless.  We took another Uber back to Fado because I had left her small bag of makeup there and returned to Altstadt Bierhalle &amp; Brathaus for a beer and some sausages.  Then we enjoyed the sound of drunk sailors singing Mariah Carey in the train back to the hotel.

Here's a tip, if you're going to rent a car, get it out of the way before the trip (like your hotel).  We woke up a little late the next day and renting a car at the airport took a little longer than usual, so we didn't get to go to Melakwa Lake and Chateau Ste Michelle like we had planned.  Instead we hit the road for Rattlesnake Ridge.  Bring a pen and paper with you, or else you'll have to go to the Ace Hardware store nearby (friendly employees) and buy a Day Pass.  Otherwise there's a sign in the parking lot with a number you can call and write down the pass on a piece of paper.  We hiked up to the first viewpoint about a mile up and just took in as much nature as we could.  I loved being surrounded by wild flowers as tall as me.  I ran around like a wild dog.  It took a couple of hours, and then we met up with a few friends of hers at Red Hook Brewery.  The nachos were ridiculously huge and filling.  By this point, we were freaking tired from everything so we went back to the hotel to sleep for a bit.  Well, we did other things first, then we slept.  I then drove us to Alki beach where we celebrated our anniversary with dinner at La Rustica.  Delicious bread, a splendid Pinot Noir, and wonderful plates of Italian food made us further exhausted but satisfied.  I drove around the northern end of the beach and stopped for one last look at the twinkling city, this time from another side.  

I messed up again the next day by not realizing soon enough that the Boeing Museum with the tour was in Everett, not Renton near the airport, so we didn't feel like rushing on vacation and just took it easy going to Redondo Beach in Des Moines.  A few people were fishing.  We hit up a coffee roaster that I can't remember the name by, as well as a couple of bars before departing for the airport and leaving for good.  

I have one more thing to say, even if your shy, this is a great place to talk to strangers.  Hell, they just come up to you and will start a conversation.  I've never gone to a city and talked to as many random people as I had here.  I'd recommend talking to everyone, your bartender, your Uber driver, that homeless guy who's just wishing you a good night.  Well, I had a blast and I can't wait to visit again.

EDIT:  One more tip, you may want to consider if its worth getting the CityPass.  I found out about it at the aquarium and didn't buy it because I was sorta half-winging it throughout the trip and didn't know if I would get its full value.  I was ultimately glad I didn't, since nothing else besides the aquarium and EMP museum was hugely interesting to me, but look into it as it might be worth it for you.",false,false,t1_ctqtvyx,CurveShepard,,0,1438668209,t5_2qhad,t3_3fof9z,t1_ctqpxnq,26,1440269687,0,1,ctqtvyx,Seattle,26,,

What do we know about the Japanese families from Seattle who were interned? I know nothing, sadly and maybe this video will spark some discussion.

I live in SE Alaska and we have a grocery store here named after the Japanese-American family that own it. Thankfully, some town folk opted to take care of their store and kept it running during their years of internment and the grocery store is still here and owned by the same family. In fact, it's just undergone a remodel and looks absolutely beautiful. The family that owns the grocery store were the only Japanese-Americans to return to my community after the war.

"&gt;This writer, for one, thinks they did the right thing, and it speaks mountains that Sanders didn’t invite them to speak even before the event happened — while it was still in the planning stages, and in fact seek to involve them in the planning. However, what was said – and left unsaid – also matters. And also, where things go from here matters.

&gt;Sanders has a history of downplaying the issue of police racism and murder. And when it was forcefully brought to his attention – at the Netroots Nation conference (with all the drawbacks of that group) – he responded by implying that all that need be done about racism is fight for jobs, free education, etc. Sure, the economic issues are intimately tied inwith the issue of racism and it’s a mistake to ignore them, but Sanders’ thinking that that’s all there is to it is totally wrong. As people point out, what good did a job do Sandra Bland or any of the other victims of police violence and racism? (For a more in-depth history of the sort of approach that Sanders takes, see this article.)

&gt;The issue of the criminal (in)justice system, including police abuse and murder, is one of the most crucial if not the most crucial issues in the US today. Until recently Bernie Sanders has pretty much whiffed on this issue and the only reason he’s changed recently is that he wasn’t allowed to go on like that. And why shouldn’t somebody at the forefront of this battle have been allowed to speak at this rally in Seattle?

"**HOUSING/RENTING**

Padmapper and Craigslist are invaluable when searching for a place to live. However, be prepared and start searching at least one month before your anticipated move date. The housing and rental market is extremely competitive and if you apply for a place you are in no way guaranteed the place until you put a check in the landlord's hand.

When searching in May/June we found that usually 4-6 people/families would apply for the same apartments we found and it was very competitive. We finally landed an apartment because I was the very first person to message the manager on Craigslist (I emailed her 11 minutes after she posted the listing - I had been watching Craigslist daily and hourly for weeks) and arrange an appointment for a viewing that same evening. I had my checkbook at the viewing and paid a holding fee on the spot to secure the apartment. Don't be afraid to be aggressive if you really like a place.

"&gt; Nobody looks at the transit engineering models and says, ""well, I see that route 11 could move more people, more quickly, with fewer buses, but those rich folks in Madison Valley would hate it, so nope!""

Correct, Metro's planning folks rely on the factual data in front of them and, I believe, make the right choice for their proposals most of the time.  But the people doing the yelling aren't yelling at Metro.  They're yelling at the elected County Council and those people have the authority to overrule Metro (specifically, they just don't pass the route change ordinance).  Some examples:

* [Save Route 2](http://www.centraldistrictnews.com/2012/01/bus2ridersgmailcom-announces-more-local-metro-meetings-and-action-plan/)!

* During the Metro service cuts debate last year, several low-performing DART routes that were recommended to be cut by Metro staff were singled out to be saved by [an amendment from Kathy Lambert](http://www.seattlemet.com/articles/2014/6/6/county-council-likely-to-adopt-republican-metro-proposal-june-2014).  Why?  She never said, but HopeLink runs the DART routes and loudly protested the cuts.

* I have no links to it but I've been directly involved in the debate over route 11.  It's coming down to Madison Park saying ""we want an all-Madison route because Trader Joe's!"" (paraphrased) versus ""what about service that the 43 would have done but it's now deleted?""

It's never so cut-and-dried as making a change will overwhelmingly reform the system.  It's about making a series of little, interlocking changes.  For example, check out the drastic differences between Metro's University Link alternative 1 and 3 restructures.  Virtually no Eastside service is being redone because people howled about the 545 not going to downtown all of the time.  Changes like straightening routes to make them more efficient, restructuring Roosevelt service (parents were up in arms about their kids walking an extra 4-5 blocks to Roosevelt HS), and rerouting some routes so they could link up with others (like a proposed route 45-&gt;271 North Seattle to Eastside connection) were imploded because people wanted their routes to stay as-is.",false,false,t1_cu4ve84,somenewuser,Central Area,0,1439736948,t5_2qhad,t3_3h6gpy,t1_cu4um9a,24,1441283070,0,0,cu4ve84,Seattle,24,,flair

"To be more specific, it is a non-profit youth organization for boys and girls aged 16 to 21.  There are three types of performers these corps audition:  

* Brass which includes: Trumpet, mellophone(french horn), Euphonium(baritone), baritone and Contra(tuba).  There are no woodwinds in drum corps
* Percussion which includes: Snare, Tenor (sometimes called quads or quints), Bass, Pit instruments (marimba, tympani, etc.) and sometimes cymbals.
* Color Guard - Dancers, flag, rifle, saber twirlers.

These shows must be at least 10 minutes long but no longer than 11 minutes and 30 seconds.  These corps hire an extensive staff to write, arrange and instruct these very elaborate shows.  Auditions and rehearsals start in the winter with weekend camps and then gradually increase as summer draws closer.  Kids who are chosen to be a part of the corps must raise money to pay for their expenses(uniforms, food, tour costs, etc.)  Then come summer, these corps tour around the country competing with other corps across the country and sometimes the world.  It all culminates in the Drum Corp International World Championships hosted in Indianapolis, Indiana.  Corps compete to  qualify in the top 25 in the preliminary competition.  Those 25 are then refined to the top 12.  These twelve will then compete for the Gold medal position.

These finals are taking place tonight in Indy.

The Seattle Cascades performed last night for the first time in three years in the semi-finals.  Unfortunately they failed to qualify for the top 12 but still had a great show.  The kids should be proud.

Also, these shows are an incredible experience if you have never witnessed one live.

"&gt; the mind-boggling amounts of money that they waste, and the hilarious inefficiencies in many federal programs

According to [this handy chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:U.S._Federal_Spending_-_FY_2011.png), sourced from Congressional Budget Office data, the U.S. government spends 34% of its annual budget on defense and 48% on Social Security and health care.  Only 18% goes to *everything else*, including interest on the national debt.

Even if every single federal program that is not one of those big three--that 18% includes every other agency not under the Department of Defense or (mostly) Department of Homeland Security, from NASA to Education to Interior--was 100% inefficient, our net spending in that category would drop from $420 billion per year to $260 billion.  Or, you know, a savings of about 1/5th of the defense budget.

My point: The person wearing that t-shirt, given the origin of that shirt and the likely motivations for having it, is in favor of the part of government that consumes more than half of the budget (let's figure he's not too keen on Medicare and Medicaid so Defense + Social Security = 58%) and only wants to reign in the oh-so-inefficient **18%** part.",false,false,t1_cudk86z,somenewuser,Central Area,0,1440388849,t5_2qhad,t3_3i3rjx,t1_cud4vzw,16,1441434452,0,0,cudk86z,Seattle,16,,flair

Also, if you could somehow get to your job via public transport you could save a lot by not spending as much on gas or other car maintenance (oil changes, brake replacements, etc.) - make sure to sign up for the Orca Lift card (http://metro.kingcounty.gov/programs-projects/orca-lift/).  Finally maybe there are some reduced cost phone and internet plans you could qualify for - for phone, something like this maybe: http://www.wireless.att.com/learn/articles-resources/community-support/lifeline-link-up.jsp#Washington and for internet, see: http://www.seattle.gov/tech/LowCostInternet.  You can also sign up for reduced cost utilities through Seattle City Light.

Your biggest barrier is going to be able to find housing that fits within your budget.  You can also try this site in addition to perusing Craigslist all day: http://www.housingsearchnw.org/

If you are willing to live in a horrible/cramped studio (is one of the dependents your gf/wife? This might be the only way this would work), you can pay as little as $450/mo. in Seattle proper. I hate to recommend an Apodment, but it could be your best bet while you are looking for something better: http://apodment.com/.  There are some efficiency apartments in the International District that run cheaper: http://wordpress.cohorealestate.com/alps-apartments-seattle-washington/ or http://wordpress.cohorealestate.com/hong-kong-apartments-seattle-washington/.  For about twice as much, you can find a decent apartment in West Seattle, though you'll have to be on top of your game - searching CL now I see maybe 1-2 listings for 1 brs in West Seattle going for ~900, and three or so listings for two bedrooms in the ~1200-1300 range.

There should be QUITE a bit of difference between apartment costs in Seattle proper and White Center, Burien (closer via public transport to Harbor Island I would imagine, but check Google Maps) and Renton, Tukwila etc.   Maybe even Seatac could be a good option.  For instance, see this 2 br in North White Center: http://seattle.craigslist.org/see/apa/5136193672.html. Also, though it's going to be hard doing this from a distance and will require coordination skills, you could also try finding another family or working adult(s) to go in on a rental house together with you.  See: http://seattle.craigslist.org/see/apa/5142273142.html.  Note good deals on houses go very quick, so you need to be organized enough with your potential housemates to pounce - sending a short paragraph about why you would be great renters for the space / your availability for viewings, and of course ready for credit checks, application fees, have proof of income, deposits, and ready to sign the dotted line, on the fly. Many landlords may wish to meet all or at least one of the tenants in person.

Good luck...I'd like to believe you can do it :)

"Holy shit, are you for real?  I will be temporarily putting aside that you've intentionally ignored my broader argument... (about how me being white and speaking out against institutionalized racism DOES NOT actually contribute toward the philosophy/idea of white supremacy/superiority, despite what the woman in the audio clip seems to infer.)

For now, I will focus toward the idea that you justify the blatant racism of (at least one of) these women by saying they are products of a self-fulfilling prophecy created by White America.  Even if that is the truth, it still doesn't justify racism, particularly when she is trying to lead/participate/spread a movement that has seemingly broad ambitions to end racism (at least institutionalized racism anyways).

Furthermore, the idea that you think I (and apparently White America, whatever the fuck that means) care more about being interrupted than I do about issues facing black people (or really any minority or disenfranchised group of people) is complete horseshit.  If that was the case, I wouldn't be throwing my full support and attention toward a candidate like Bernie Sanders.  I can't speak for all white Seattle liberals, (although by your statements and tone, it seems to me that you think that YOU can) but I assume they feel the same or similar as I.  Sanders has a proven track record dating back almost his entire adult life of fighting for minority rights, poor people, broken justice system (again particularly towards black people), and so on.

I speak passionately about Sanders to my friends and family because his message, just like many others before him, resonates strong within me.  I know that just by being black, one's chances of getting a good job are lower, one's chances of being convicted of a crime are higher, one's chances of being arrested or negatively treated by police is higher, and the list goes on.  Pretty much every measurable statistic is not in favor of black people, and I do understand that is because of institutionalized racism (whether intended or not) exists strongly in the current system.  I seek to end institutionalized racism, and I do that by trying to support and spread the message of a man that I believe has an actual genuine shot of doing just that.

Also, you show some lack of understanding in how city growth works.  To my eyes, you seem to infer that Seattle is almost some centralized entity that is intentionally raising its cost of living to get rid of minorities.  That's some tinfoil hat shit.  I myself am a poor person, soon to hit 30, trying to restart life by earning a college degree while working more hours than I would like in order to meet this rising cost of living.  This rising cost of living is PRIMARILY (but not solely) happening because of extremely low supply in housing while simultaneously having an extremely high demand for housing.  This is PRIMARILY because of how immensely fast this city and its surrounding areas are growing.

As for the SPD, I am in complete agreement.  Not just for the SPD, but for any police.  The fact that police organizations in America are so militarized is scary.  I am all for measures that limit a police officers ability to kill people and instead do the job that society actually needs them to do.  Police should probably be from the neighborhoods and areas in which they patrol.  Racial profiling should be more than just discouraged, but also trained into each and every officer with the facts backing up that training as why its bad and doesn't work.  There are so many ways that police could approach any number of encounters in so many better ways.  The fact that they seem so damn eager to draw their weapons is terrifying.

EDIT:  Realized I never responded your last statement. 

&gt; Furthermore, Black Lives Matter isn't a monolithic movement with centralized control. If you write off the movement due to the actions of two people, you probably didn't support it much in the first place.

"[this is a map](http://seattletransitblog.com/2011/11/28/map-of-u-s-traffic-accident-fatalities/) of traffic fatalities from 2000-2009.  Notice that no pedestrian fatalities occurred in Pike Place Market, while several occurred downtown east of the Market. 
[this is a map](http://old.seattletimes.com/flatpages/local/pedestrianandbicyclecollisionsinseattle.html) of pedestrian/car accidents in Seattle from 2007-2014.  While some Pedestrian/Automobile collisions occurred in the Market, the rest of downtown looks worse. 

It's counterintuitive that a place as chaotic as Pike Pl. would be safer for pedestrians but I believe that's what the collision data is suggesting.  One theory (and I'm sure there are many) that might explain this is that the chaos Pike Pl. makes the cars slow down, and cars simply don't pose much of a threat when they are travelling at really low speeds. 

Furthermore, I'd like to take issue with this comment:

&gt;   The exact problem described in this article, e.g. people being hit by cars. 

I'm sure the investigation is ongoing, but from the article:

""The driver, described as an elderly man, told officers his foot got stuck between the gas and the brake of the rental car.""

This situation would have been hazardous no matter where it happened; it has less to do with Pike Place Market's open car policy than it does with the driver.

"Environmentalism, as it is formulated today, requires reduction of consumption. Travel requires immense resources. If people are supposed to reduce consumption, where do liberals think this excess consumption lies? We're burning oil, how terrible! Stop drilling! But, just drill enough to provide the jet fuel to get me to Europe for the summer!

Fashion, basically, is consumerism at its finest. It is engineered to change on a regular basis to keep up consumption. It is totally without meaning aside from its power to assert oneself in a social hierarchy, both to signal one's means to purchase the new item, and one's ability to determine what the new item *is*. I mean, look back at the prior forty years: people laugh hysterically at what used to be considered fashionable. As soon as it no longer signals your social status, it becomes worthless and ugly. Basically, being fashionable shows a lack of solidarity. It challenges the poor to keep up, makes them feel less-than, envious etc. 

The unifying current running through it all is that liberals today do not believe they have the individual power to affect change. But, it is because, individually, they cannot abide by their own value system because the temptation to violate it is too great. No one is keeping them down. It is acknowledged that *their own desires* are keeping them down. Their inability to resist the advertising industry and the fruits of capitalism is what is keeping them down.

"While it may be a ""textbook case of Male Answer Syndrome"", you have a case of ""textbook case of Male Hearing Syndrome"".

I explained quite well the difference and the issue isn't that one is better than the other but that it depends on if the area is currently burning or if it is in the path of a burn. Areas in the path of the fire will be better suited by a light pour over a longer period because the water will soak in and thus do better at keeping the fire from spreading to that area. However, areas that are burning currently will be better suited by a downpour, as the mass of the droplet needs to be enough water that the evaporation from the heat of the fire will not evaporate the droplet before it reaches the target (the fire). A light pour on the heart of the fire will lower the temperature but as long as the fires temperature remains above a certain threshold, it will continue to spread both above and below ground. The downpour needs to be such that moisture actually reaches the material burning and thus a downpour is best at dropping the temperature of a fire but not at soaking an area that is in the path of the fire.

However, he has pointed out that in particular for the PNW, we will likely have longer, hotter summers and lower snowfall in the mountains (both similar to this summer) but will maintain close to current rainfall levels. So for us in the PNW, it isn't all ""bad."" I suppose that can rub some people the wrong way because he didn't add the obvious fact that on the whole, it is ""bad.""

It's just very hard to simplify the science for a layman to understand without making incorrect statements or overstating things. You can't say, ""we had a big storm/hurricane/forest fire because of climate change."" - it just isn't true. But you see this constantly in the media and Cliff has spoken out against these types of articles quite often.

"I have a pair of crows (Jay and Silent Bob) who visit my porch every morning, looking for leftover cat food, and one in particular (Jay) sits out there and raises one hell of a ruckus if there's none to be found. I've taken to feeding the cats really early in the morning, before the birds are active, and as soon as I hear the damned crows (well, okay, *crow,* because Silent Bob is silent) I bring the cats' dishes, with any leftovers, inside. I also can't feed the cats their dinner until after the crows have settled in for the evening.

As I'm typing this, I can hear Jay screeching away on my front porch, where he and Silent Bob are no doubt shitting on the chairs (which have no cushions now because the covers got ruined by crow shit).

2) Based on the video and (unconfirmed) reports I've seen, Sanders didn't ask security to step in.  He seemed very calm about the whole thing and never seemed to be in any sort of immediate danger, so security respected his wishes.


My personal opinion is that Sanders came across as patient, reasonable, and very classy here.  He didn't argue or get into a shouting match, he didn't call security to have anyone hauled away, and he seemed open to listening to differing opinions.  When it became clear that he wouldn't get a chance to speak he didn't walk off behind closed doors in a huff or speed away in a limo surrounded by security- he walked into the crowd and shook their hands.",false,false,t1_ctxebp1,trentsgir,Capitol Hill,0,1439164846,t5_2qhad,t3_3gdbzv,t1_ctxclwi,130,1440383170,0,0,ctxebp1,Seattle,130,,flair

"http://www.seattle.gov/transportation/bridgeopenings.htm

&gt; Federal law gives marine traffic the right-of-way over vehicular traffic. The City of Seattle must apply to the U.S. Coast Guard for exceptions to that rule. The exception for bridge closures during rush-hour periods is granted by the Coast Guard. The Coast Guard also allows vessels to be held for 10 minutes on the Lake Washington Ship Canal bridges to allow accumulated vehicular traffic to clear.

The Fremont Bridge is opened more frequently than other draw bridges because it has the least clearance at only 30 feet. Many boats that can safely pass under the Ballard Bridge, for example, still need to raise the Fremont bridge. 

I feel your pain, though. I take the #28 to work and during the summer it seems like the bridge is always open, adding 10 minutes to my commute each way. I understand the law, but in practice it is a bit silly, especially since it's an artificial waterway. When 100s of people are backed up for a small recreational sailboat, I can't help but to feel like we're not making the best use of our resources. Things like tolling and limited/scheduled openings would help a lot. I am resigned to the fact that this'll probably never happen though, and try to just enjoy the novelty of it.

"Wanted to piggy-back on this just to offer my own experience, since it's very different from the other parts of Amazon that I have heard so many rumors about.

I have worked on projects outside of the retail/AWS world, and have had no problem sticking very close to 40 hour work weeks. People in the departments I've worked in have been happy and good to work with, and I've never seen anything like what the NYT article described. Some people choose to work insane hours, but that's their own business. They may feel pressured to do so, which really sucks (they're good developers and deserve their time off) but personally I've never gotten any feedback about needing to work longer hours than I do. The thing that really bothers me is the company-sponsored visa that many immigrants get, which they would lose it if they left Amazon / were fired. Basically they're held hostage, and I've seen many devs work long hours partly because of this. That is super shitty.

Of course some of the negatives about Amazon highlighted in the article are true.

"* Seattle Neighborhoods
  * Greenwood

**General description**  
West of 99 to 8th, from 75th to 105th.  Greenwood is an ""up-and-coming"" neighborhood with a lot of established residents and some young professional families displaced by prices in nearby neighborhoods like Wallingford and Queen Anne.  Prices are on the rise as development increases and the city grows, and the neighborhood has a strong mix of residential options.  

Median Home Value:  $453,000

The heavy development has claimed a number of its older businesses, but they have been replaced by a strong stable of restaurants and bars.  Greenwood is a [walkable neighborhood](https://www.walkscore.com/score/8300-greenwood-ave-n-seattle-wa-98103) with low crime rates, and features several options for groceries (Fred Meyer, QFC, Safeway).  99 provides easy access by car or bus (RapidRide E line) to downtown Seattle.  The E line used to be the 358, and can have some riders who make things exciting outside of commute times.

**Farmer's Market?**  
Nope.  Greenwood hates farmers.

**Schools**  
The local public elementary is [Greenwood Elementary](http://sps.ss8.sharpschool.com/common/pages/DisplayFile.aspx?itemId=305257) with test scores around average to slightly above average, and 22% on reduced or free lunch.

The district feeds to [Ballard High School](http://www.seattleschools.org/UserFiles/Servers/Server_543/File/Migration/Schools/School%20Directory/Departmental%20Content/siso/schoolreports/2012/SchoolReport_2012_011.pdf), which shows above average test scores.

"Full disclosure: I'm a bit more emotionally invested in this than many other people in this thread. I knew Donnie Chin, and I work in the ID, barely a block from where he was killed, but I hope to give a little bit of a different perspective.

I'm not in support of shutting down ALL hookah bars, but King's has been a particular nuisance in this location. It is literally across the street from [Legacy House](http://www.legacyhouse.org/), low-income housing for primarily non-English speaking elderly, [Denise Louie Education Center](http://deniselouie.org/), an Early Head Start program for low-income and immigrant children, and [ICHS - ID Clinic](http://www.ichs.com/), which provides health care to the community and beyond.

I have been to community meetings where residents complain that they don't feel safe walking home late at night, that cars will race down 8th Avenue and sit in the middle of the street at 2 in the morning. Community leaders have been advocating police to bring more presence to this block for a long time, long before Donnie was killed, because community members have felt less safe since its opening. Murray has a lot of pressure from the C/ID residents and advocates to shut it down and SPD has had meetings with hookah bar owners to figure out how to keep them open, but make it safe, and yet nothing has worked.

Under RCW 59.18.210 , leases over 12 months must be notarized in order to be valid. Leases also restrict the landlord from increasing the rent or changing the rules of tenancy during the fixed term. Tenants are obligated to meet the conditions of the lease for the full term or face penalties.

A lease expires at the end of the lease term unless the contract states otherwise. Typically, a one year lease may contain language that converts the tenancy to month-to-month at the end of the stated lease term.

"Oh boy, another shitstorm where nobody's going to change anybody's minds. 

I, personally, hate cyclists in this area. They act like every driver personally owes them something. That the entire roadway is theirs to use as they see fit, and everybody else (even pedestrians) are secondary. They blow through stop signs and stop lights, they split lanes, they jump queues, and they don't pay any additional taxes to maintain the infrastructure they claim they need. They all act like entitled little crybabies when it comes to traffic. 

However, drivers here *are* getting more aggressive. I also hate all drivers in this area now. I've seen more people blowing through red lights. I've seen more people blocking intersections and parking in the cycling lane. I've seen people with gigantic SUVs or trucks park 6 inches from a stop sign that clearly has a ""30 feet"" sign posted on it. I've seen drivers just double-park downtown to run into a shop. Then you have the assholes who are so goddamn cautious that they end up causing chaos and carnage all around them. 

And then the fucking bus drivers around here. One minute they're barely idling along while blocking 2 lanes of traffic, the next they're barreling through intersections and slamming on their brakes. 

And then let's talk about the fucking pedestrians. Trotting across an intersection that's already turned yellow. Aggressive jaywalking. Can't even look up from their phones when crossing streets. Just stop in the middle of the sidewalk to check their phones. Seeming oblivious that they're not the only people there. 

The problem is that this whole area is simply getting too congested. Our quality of life is going down. Every time you do any sort of transit, it feels like you're going into battle. Commuting here is just shitty, and will continue to be shitty until we get off our asses and build some mass transit into most of the area.

* In [1972](http://metro.kingcounty.gov/am/history/history-1970.html) voters allow a small transit tax for busses, but reject the tax for electric rail. (Even the meager vote for busses was the first time Seattleites approved new taxes for transit since 1918)  

* In [1995](http://metro.kingcounty.gov/am/history/history-1990.html), voters reject a Regional Transit Authority (later Sound Transit) measure for a gigantic, $6.7 billion transportation system over three counties that would’ve featured commuter rail, light rail, express buses, and expanded HOV lanes 

* In 1999, with Initiative 695, local voters show their love of Tim Eyman and regressivism- scrapping the progressive car excise fee for a super-regressive $30 state car tabs. Since 29% of the vehicle excise tax went to local transit, local communities have been scrambling to keep their buses running ever since. 

* In 2002, voters showed their hatred of forward-thinking transit/infrastructure funding and support an Eyman initiative yet again: voters approved I-776,which restricted local governments from adding their own excise taxes and limited local license tab fees. While the measure was shot down at first for being unconstitutional, it was upheld by the State Supreme Court in October 2003. 776 repealed many taxes that the public had [already voted on](https://researchcouncil.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/initiative776.pdf)  

* In [2005](http://www.seattlepi.com/local/transportation/article/Monorail-will-go-to-voters-for-5th-time-1183631.php), Mayor Nickels gets the ""all-or-nothing"" plan for a West Seattle-Ballard monorail on the ballot. The plan is a watered down, poor version of the original, so it failed. Its rejection gutted Seattle Monorail Partners, which had been working to upgrade our transit system since they were created by a public vote in 1997. Council President Jan Drago (accurately) expressed fear that not building the monorail segment means ""we will pass it to future generations."" **Now look where we are!** 

* In [2011](http://seattlest.com/2011/07/13/last_night_people_are_voting_with_t.php): The Congestion Reduction Fee. When our regressive and outdated sales tax revenue plummets during the recession – the King County Council approves a $20 fee on vehicle tabs to make up the $60 million deficit, collected in 2012  through 2014  

* In [2014](http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/with-transit-money-approved-seattle-pledges-to-spend-new-dollars-well/), Seattleites vote *FOR* maintaining some bus transit, with more regressive taxes - a $60 car-tab fee and a 0.1 percent sales-tax increase - to keep many bus lines from being cut and to expand services on a couple bus lines. 


Just think where we could be now if voters hadn't rejected mass transit on multiple occasions and hadn't supported regressive taxation and Tim Eyman's anti-transit, anti-infrastructure initiatives.

"Do not buy diamonds locally.

Go to Pricescope and spend time learning about the industry and how to avoid being a huge sucker (if you're buying a diamond, you're a sucker anyways - just try to maximize value to minimize this).

I prefer AGS000 over GIA XXX because AGS also rates light return, which is one of the most important characteristics. It's all about the cut! Do not skimp on the cut! Do not buy diamonds with characteristics that cannot be appreciated by the naked eye, at that point you're paying for rarity rather than visible quality. So, no D color diamonds, no internally flawless, etc. Total waste of money. Check out the Holloway Cut Advisor before making a purchase.

I purchased a 1.75 carat AGS000 Brian Gavin Signature round last year after doing tons of research. Search Whiteflash, Brian Gavin, Bluenile, etc. Diamonds are a commodity and stock changes frequently, check daily until you find exactly what you want at a fair price.

EDIT: Buy online, out-of-state to save on sales tax! It can make a significant difference.

I had a setting custom made by Mark Morrel and couldn't be happier with it. Same price as getting something off the shelf.

A comparable ring from Tiffany would have set me back at least 3x-8x. Do your research to make the most of your budget.

"&gt; Anybody know for a fact that streetcars work better to induce density than busses

I don't know about specific research, but one reason may be ""[the inflexibility of the routes](http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2015-03-17/d-c-ponders-the-fate-of-its-streetcars):""

&gt;If you're trying to spur development with transportation, then inflexibility is a feature, rather than a bug: It allows you to make a credible commitment to serving an area over a long time period. A city can always promise to run a bus line, of course ... but the city and the developers both know that the city can move that bus somewhere else if the development takes longer than expected to materialize, leaving the developer with a giant, expensive building that's hard to get to. Streetcars are also an easily visible signal to potential businesses and residents -- you can see the tracks right there, rather than having to hunt for information about local bus service.

&gt;Effectively, streetcars harness the sunk cost fallacy for a little bit of good: Developers know that the government will be reluctant to give upon on a project once it has already spent a lot of money, so they feel more comfortable betting on transit-oriented development.

There's also (usually) less route anxiety, and it's easier to figure out where the streetcar will stop: The same places it's always stopped. The 4 / 5 / 6 trains in New York have stopped at the same places for a century! But how many of us know where random bus route XYZ goes?

"The ACLU is barking up the wrong tree, I think.

The problem is waaaay more metastasized than just a few bad actors who discriminate (which I never saw when I worked there) .  Amazon doesn't have a culture miasma because of the long hours or competition either.  Many people enjoy their work and enjoy making a difference.  Rather, people are outraged and frustrated at the culture of random crisis and backlash that they are forced to live under.  They see good employees ""Managed Out"" of the organization; who work 80+ hour weeks right up until they get discouraged and quit, citing the long hours.  They live in fear that it could happen to them too, because there is just no logical reason why periodic lightning bolts should just shoot down and fry people.  

So, they blame a perceived mandate for long hours.  They blame stack ranking.  They blame tangible things that they can grasp because they don't want to live in a world were a member of leadership (who they want to trust) can choose to ruin their life because some boss says to himself ""I'm going to put that guy in his place because I just don't like him.""

Weasel Boss alert:  Few if any of these employees were bullied out of the company because of discrimination or the quality or quantity of their work.  They typically were ""Performance Managed"" because they made a well intentioned comment that insulted the wrong member of leadership.

Here is a random example, but I guarantee you 90% of the employees quoted in the article had this happen to them.  They think they were driven out because they just couldn't handle the hours.  Not true.  Not true.  One of my Amazon bosses was the Site Leader who ran the FC that I worked at, and one day she showed our facilities guy a bench she had put together.  He (with good intentions) pointed out a flaw she had made, so that the next time she can build a better bench.  Big. Mistake.  This was the beginning of the end, because from then on, in her mind he simply had to go.  

She criticized everything he did.  If he did make an error, she made a huge deal about it.  If he did something successful, she ignored it or downplayed it.  She talked smack about him to everyone in leadership, and when I tried to point out the true reality, she actually told me to stop defending him.  She told me to shut my mouth about all of his good work.  I lacked the courage to tell the facilities guy what was going on, mostly because I could not see the forest for the trees.  Also, I feared retaliation in case the facilities guy exposed the motivations of this TPOS Site Leader.  Perversely, this made him work longer and harder, to make up for his ""Poor Performance in Aligning with Leadership Principles.""   

Not once did this site leader ever tell the facilities guy what he REALLY need to do in order to save his job:  Fall down and grovel for forgiveness at her feet.  In the culture of deceit and misdirection that infests Amazon, this kind of ""Dark Triad"" mentality is very common; and EVERYONE in leadership is aware that this is going on.  The members of leadership who speak up in defense of the NYT article do so out of either fear or greed.  They know its all true.  They know they have created a crap sandwich work environment, and have every intention of making their employees and customers gobble it down.  The facilities guy worked himself crazy and was driven out in shame with the overall perception that he just couldn't cut it.  In reality, he outperformed everyone else doing that sort of work.

Sitting here at my desk I still feel loathing for the people at Amazon that can so casually ruin a good man's life because their Narcissism has been used to slash and burn their way to positions of influence. 

At Amazon, there really is no requirement to put in long hours.  Employees that are willing to lie, juke the metrics, and cover the errors in judgment made by their boss can do absolutely nothing at all at work and still keep their job.  People interpret these employees as ""Being buddies with the boss"" but its not really that... its the Confederation of Weaseldom that these Weasels use to play Survivor and vote everyone else off the island.  Those that work long hours and do great work, but refuse to cheat the metrics and invent a narrative that makes their boss look like a superhero are put under a kind of Kafkaesque pressure that the boss knows the employee will interpret as ""work long hours and be miserable, and then give up and quit because its just not worth it.""  That is Amazon leadership's plan all along, and is SOP in all groups at Amazon that I interacted with.

The problems at Amazon have nothing to do with competition, discrimination, or time demands.  These are ALL red herrings. The problem at Amazon is that they have become Microsoft.

""Bezos urges employees to bring their concerns to their leadership or HR.""  No one will.  Why?  Because they will be the ones ""Performance Managed"" next as having self identified as a subversive.

"This is an important point that a lot of transit advocates--I am definitely one--either miss or gloss over.  The ones that *do* get it are just as frustrated as you are since we're on those buses and things do get clogged up.

Here's why this happens, at least from my perspective: Seattle's transit network is limited primarily by geography but a close second is ""hardheadedness.""  Our routes are primarily based on bringing people from all corners of the city into downtown or the university and then taking them back out again.  Yes, some of that is geography--there are only so many ways to get to and from each point--but a lot of that is because long-time riders have gotten used to how things are and don't want their routes to change.  It is difficult to convince someone of future value when they see their *present* value as being degraded.

Potential riders or people who need to be convinced don't have as much passion or interest in the system so they aren't heard as much.  Meanwhile, you have routes like #2 which desperately needs an overhaul but has a small, vocal group rallying for it to stay exactly as-is.  (Madison Park / Madison Valley residents, I'm glaring at you in regards to route 11.)

We need a gridded bus system almost as badly as we need grade-separated transit.  There's no reason why getting from the western Central District to the middle of Capitol Hill, a trip of less than two miles, should today take two ill-timed buses and 40 minutes.  Except legacy.

Difficulty level?  Very, very high.  We tried a ""big bang"" restructure in 2011 when RapidRide A and B came on.  The howls of protest are just now beginning to die down.

"Glassdoor salaries for engineers are pretty accurate based on my own experiences. It'd be unusual to not be making six figures after a couple of years (might be even sooner for newer hires, not sure what they're starting college hires at these days), not including RSUs and signing bonuses. 

The perks that I experienced:

* Almost everyone I worked with was absolutely brilliant. There was little to no incompetence.
* I got to work on projects that were very impactful. I knew hundreds of thousands of people were hitting my code every day. That was cool. It made me feel important.
* I got Amazon on my resume. I haven't been denied an interview anywhere since.
* I got to work with many other teams. One of my code changes impacted 36 other teams. So really, it was a highly social job, and I made a lot of connections.
* Many of those connections have since quit Amazon, so now I have a lot of connections all over the industry.
* I was trusted pretty much from the start to do important things. I was held to a high standard. I am the kind of person who performs well when other people tell me I am capable. The assumption at Amazon was that everyone who was there to begin with was capable.
* I learned a lot.

Might also want to let them know - they may be doing more harm than good in this particular instance -  I'm a vehement supporter of their cause, and fully support confrontation of those at odds with the movement.

"&gt;I know some folks will say this is due to global warming, represents the ""new normal"", or was due to the BLOB (the warm water off our coast). At this point, there is no reason to expect that any of these hypotheses are true.  Climate simulations do not produce stronger midlatitude cyclones like Saturday's.  Natural variability can produce extremes and this is probably a good example.

This is exactly why Cliff gets labelled a denier. His smarmy attributions to natural variability are as sloppy as those who hastily implicate anthropogenic global warming. Indeed, there are few reasons to believe that this was a ""new normal"" event. But there are only scant reasons to believe otherwise. I get why he does it—alarmism is annoying—but Prof. Mass is too often merely the scientific equivalent of a poster replying ""inb4"" or ""First!"" We'd all be better off if he just stuck to weather.

"... What a bunch of shit this is.  Those two women who interrupted the rally were being boo'ed (and some cheers, but mostly boos) NOT because they were black, but because they were rude fucking people who, without permission or a good reason, interrupted Bernie Sanders before he could barely get a sentence out and threatened to shut the place down unless they got a chance to speak.

Then, she accused everyone there of being racist.  Are you fucking kidding me?  This same woman is then seen in a photo (selfie) seen [here](http://i.imgur.com/oFNAJSf.jpg) wearing a t-shirt saying ""Sipping on White Tears"" while drinking a glass of what looks like water.

I am glad to start having these discussions, but when I listen to NPR, and this audio clip, and listen to analysts of any given background start being critical of the crowd for the way they acted, I get livid.  Not a single person seems to brave enough to call this horrible fucking person what she is.  At first, I was booing her myself because she was just being a rude fucking person.  I still now boo her and worse not just because shes a rude person, but because she herself is nothing more than another piece of shit racist, just as bad as any genuinely racist white person she seems to be crusading against.

As for this Audio clip, I can't help but feel frustrated and annoyed.  Basically, simply by being White I am somehow perpetuating white superiority or supremacy by even speaking out against it.  What a load of shit.  In order to fix institutionalized racism, EVERYONE needs to recognize it and speak out against it INCLUDING WHITE PEOPLE.

"My understanding is that the KCSO kind of views the transit division as a dumping ground.....   Caballero has had some other issues in the past, including being a party in improper handling of narcotics evidence.  (in below, I believe the first two 2011 dates are actually 2010)

http://www.kingcounty.gov/~/media/safety/sheriff/documents/k/KristopherKizerCert.ashx?la=en

On June 10, 2011, Kizer sent the King County Sheriff’s Office Property Management Unit **Sergeant Lou Caballero** an e-mail *requesting “ecstasy up to around 200-300 tabs/pills. Cocaine up to 2 ½ or 3 ounces, and around a pound of meth*. The ecstasy I have none of, the coke and meth that I have is old and need to be changed. The current dope I have is Bellevue stuff in case you to looking and could find it.”

Sgt. Caballero authorized the release of the narcotic’s to Kizer for training and directed him how to process the receipt of the narcotics for record keeping purposes. Sgt. Caballero directed Kizer to draw a current King County Sheriff case number and “write an information case report listing all of the narcotics he was receiving as new evidence items under the new case number.” Sgt. Caballero was present when Kizer called and obtained the case number 10-178088.

On July 30, 2011, Kizer took possession of the following narcotics:
58.3 grams of crack cocaine
132.6 grams of powder cocaine
26.95 grams of methamphetamine
135 Ecstasy pills
The estimated street value of the narcotics listed above is $20,753.00.

On February 7, 2011, Sgt. Caballero received notice that Kizer had resigned from the King County Sheriff’s Office. According to Sgt. Caballero “this notice triggers our Department Quartermaster to generate a list of department issued property for return. The inventory is limited to uniforms and equipment and does not address the narcotics that were issued for training. That would have been an action managed locally transferring the narcotics to the next K-9 handler.”

On February 22, 2011, Deputy Murphy of the King County Sheriff’s Office returned some of Kizer’s property to the Property Management Unit. He turned in little equipment and no uniforms.

Sgt. Caballero asked Murphy why Kizer had resigned. Murphy told him that “Kizer just started acting crazy and had started spending hours in his garage. He stated that Kizer had moved stuff into the garage and had one time spent almost 48 hours in the garage taking apart computers and showing extreme behavior/mood swings.”

Sgt. Caballero *“immediately became concerned about the whereabouts of the narcotics”*. He did a computer check and discovered that * Kizer had never written a case report documenting his receipt of the narcotics on July 30, 2010*.

Sgt. Caballero then contacted Sgt. Gerald Watkins at the Eastside Narcotics Taskforce and shared his concerns. According to Sgt. Watkins he did not have any knowledge that Kizer had checked out any narcotics from the King County Sheriff’s Office Property Management Unit. Sgt. Watkins asked Sgt. Caballero why he hadn’t been notified that Kizer had checked out the narcotics and Caballero told he’d *assumed that Kizer had his permission.*",false,false,t1_cuf8lrf,ChefJoe98136,West Seattle,0,1440521857,t5_2qhad,t3_3icde0,t1_cuf6q17,15,1441490241,0,0,cuf8lrf,Seattle,15,,flair

"+1 on Sosio's.  Their produce is top-quality, and they're nice folks.  They're never too busy to give some advice on what's the best today, or how to prepare what you're buying, or when to check back for something that's not in season yet.

Likewise Don &amp; Joe's Meats--great products, nice folks, always helpful.  My husband is addicted to their ""trail mix"" (chopped pepperoni, meat sticks, jerky, and cheeses), which they told me they started making to have something to sell to the tourists.  Summer is when the Market is the busiest, but it's Don &amp; Joe's slowest time, because the hordes of tourists make the locals stay away--and tourists don't buy a lot of fresh meat.

DeLaurenti has a lot of great Italian and other Mediterranean specialty items.  Sure, you pay a premium there--some of their merchandise you can find for a lot less at Big John's PFI, but some you can't.  They also have one of the best cheese selections in town, and some really good cured meats (and much as I love Big John's, they make you buy a pound of cheese at a time, and I don't always need that much--and they won't slice their meats, and DeLaurenti will).  Their wine department is also pretty good, and they've given me some good advice when I wasn't sure what to buy.

Holmquist Hazelnut Orchards has a day stall in the North Arcade, several days a week.  Their hazelnuts are Washington-grown, and they're the best--really fresh and top-quality.  I never realized how lucky we are, to be able to get them so easily here, until I sent some to a friend in the Midwest.  She went on and on about them--how great they were, how hard they were to find there, how impressed everyone was with what she baked with them.

Simply the Best--the dried fruit stand right across from the fish-throwing guys--does not lie.  Their dried apple chips are far and away the best I've ever had.

Britt's Pickles makes GREAT pickles--not just cucumbers, but kraut, kimchi, garlic, preserved lemons, and other stuff.  I don't feel too bad grazing on their free samples, because I never walk away without buying something!

El Mercado Latino has Caribbean and Latin American products I can't find anywhere else.  I live in the south end, so I can shop in my neighborhood for Mexican and Central American stuff, but El Mercado Latino has things that stores down here often don't.

The Souk is great for Middle Eastern and South Asian food products.

Uli's Famous Sausage has some of the best sausage in town--lots of varieties, all natural, no preservatives.

But my favorite, most irreplaceable place at the Market is World Spice.  Not Market Spice, the place that's actually in the Market, just south of Don &amp; Joe's Meats (they're just okay, IMHO), but the shop behind the main Market buildings, down on on Western Avenue, next to the Public Market Parking Garage.  They have an amazing selection of spices, spice blends, and teas, and the quality is magnificent.  They're nice folks and really helpful with advice (and they have a great recipe blog).  They could charge me to come in the store and just sniff the air, and I would pay it!

"No way. Only if you had some sort of housing deal - you lived with friends and had to pay very little, etc.

Here's how I see it: A lot of people pay as much as 50% of their income for housing. 25% or less is recommended, 33% is more like average. With student loans and 2 dependants 33% is the max you could pay and still keep food on the table. So, $2400 minus minimum Federal &amp; State Taxes (10%) would give you a take home of around $2160. 33% of $2160 is $721.80.

Can you get a place in the city for $712.80 per month that is big enough for 3 people to live, even if they double up? Not without subsidized housing!

You know what happened? The fire would spread, burning down entire blocks, sometimes resulting in the other paying customers further down the block having their houses burn and losses of life.

At some point, a collective common sense took hold and people realized that for-profit companies don't always provide the best service for society as a whole. Hence we have public Fire Departments paid for with (gasp!) tax monies.

What self-driving cars won't help: peak commuter demand.

I actually do think self-driving cars are inevitable and will remake the transportation landscape. But... I don't think that looks like everyone taking a self-driving car to work instead of mass transit.

More realistically, self-driving cars will allow more people to use cars as an a la carte service (Uber, Car2go) and thus for society to own fewer cars that don't sit parked 95% of the time. In the future, each time you step out your door, you'll likely be making a decision to hail a car, ride a bike, walk, or take transit. You won't just pick the default option sitting in your driveway. That should mean a lot more people choose those ""alternative"" modes, meaning that service and infrastructure will improve.

I tried to comfort her buy telling her that the likelihood of her friend being involved was slim to none, and that she shouldn't worry. 

An hour later she received a call from her friend's mother, telling her that her daughter had been at that house and was killed. She broke into tears, repeating ""I knew it, I knew it."" I was at a complete loss for words, and all that I could manage was ""I'm so sorry."" It was horrible, absolutely horrible. I went to the memorial service with her. I'll never forget it.

"I'm someone who is blatantly oblivious to most Politics and actively avoids political news.  I'm completely ignorant to what's going on.  You can call me part of the problem, I guess, but I'd rather read about movie and sports news over serious issues.  Anyways, up until yesterday I couldn't even tell you which political party Bernie Sanders was involved in.  I'm so out of touch with Politics that I think the first time I even heard of Bernie Sanders was maybe two days ago when I briefly glanced at this ""MAD Magazine Political Movie Posters"" thing:  https://www.ringoffireradio.com/2015/08/mad-magazine-publishes-hilarious-movie-posters-of-the-presidential-candidates/ ...

So as someone who is so shamelessly out of the loop, I'd say these ladies set their movement back quite a bit yesterday.   Their behavior was disgusting and disrespectful.  If they are trying to wake up folks like me to their cause, they may have had an opposite effect, because I spent an hour yesterday (that I normally wouldn't have spent) reading that Bernie Sanders is apparently a Jewish Democratic candidate with a long history of supporting Civil Rights movements... and I also ended up reading up on the reality of the Michael Brown situation (apparently shot in self defense and is a poor example to use to highlight cop abuse)... which was news to me as well.

"Well, okay. But I was at the *Westlake* event and I stood out there in the heat and sun for two hours listening to shitty folk music and some pretty uninteresting and borderline boring speakers. I came there -- planned my entire week around this -- to see Bernie at Westlake. And it was pretty disrespectful of these two girls to prevent him from speaking. I was in that crowd -- and I think most people, after things hushed down, expected after the four and a half minutes of silence that they'd say a couple of words and then the event would go on. But these two just totally filibustered the guy. Once the silence was done, and after they had insulted the audience again, then they wanted to ""try"" him like it was some kind of court. **That's when Bernie left.** And I don't fucking blame him.

I just fucking wanted to see this guy who I've idolized for over a decade. Bernie Sanders was a voice of reason during the terrifying years of the Bush Administration. He stands for working class people. He stands to fight gross income inequality in all races, particularly minorities. We are judged by how we treat least well off among us. He stands against corporate profiteering of healthcare. Getting sick is not an excuse for companies to profit off the backs of the poor. He stands to try to move us into the fucking future. Apparently that's not good enough.

I think it's kind of racist to look out amongst a crowd of (admittedly) mostly white people and just assume they are all a bunch of racists for being white. Treat others the way you would like to be treated. Isn't that the golden rule? God only knows I actively am aware of white privilege and I don't deny racism as a constant unending event. I do everything humanly possible to stop from perpetuating it. What the fuck? I'm already on the side of trying to be constructive here. I am respectful of people, I support progressive causes -- including Black Lives Matter. **Don't call your allies a bunch of fucking white supremacists.**

"If you're referring to the recent article that's been going around saying that everything west of I-5 is doomed, that's more than a bit sensationalized.  If I were less tired, I'd not be lazy and dig up the articles where the UW geologists discussed what was incorrect in that article.  But at the very basic level, yes, the Cascadia Subduction Zone will cause a major earthquake at some point in the future.  We do not know when.  That will cause some problems for the city, and parts of downtown will liquify because of 1) it being a former tidal flat, and 2) the fill they used to build it up included a lot of sawdust which is now decayed. Seattle itself is fairly protected when it comes to the tsunami that quake will generate.  It will cause problems, yes, but not as much as for the beach cities or Everett.  

Thing is, most people survive earthquakes.  It's the aftermath that's uncomfortable for people.  Having a plan, being prepared, that's what will determine how comfortable you and your family will be after a quake.  If you're worried about moving to Seattle because of the earthquake possibilities, keep in mind we also have five volcanoes in the state, two of which you can see from the city on a nice day.  There's just as much chance of them being a problem as the earthquake.  

Of course, I've grown up on the west coast, and earthquakes have always been a part of my life.  Just as the South has its hurricanes, the mid-west has their tornadoes, we have earthquakes.

"* Be a Tourist
  * Ride the Ducks

**Ride the Ducks**  
Ride the Ducks is a popular way for tourists (and some locals) to ride around the city in open-air vintage amphibious vehicles.  It sticks to primarily residential areas, and does not leave the city.  While the tour varies greatly depending on your guide, it's a nice way to see a number of neighborhoods, get out on Lake Union and see Seattle from a slightly different angle.

Locals have a variety of opinions about the tour -- while most ignore it or recognize it as a harmless diversion, occasionally you'll see some that are openly hostile, particularly if they live or work near the tour route (it can be noisy).  Your guide will likely try to distract you or drown them out.

If it's not sunny the tour can get a bit cold, so check the weather and bring a sweater if needed.

You'll drive or float by:

* The Sleepless in Seattle houseboat.
* Pioneer Square
* Westlake Center (Say Anything)
* The monorail (Assassins)
* The Space Needle/Seattle Center (the slender thread and an Elvis movie)
* Experience Music Project
* Gasworks Park (10 things I hate about you)
* The Gates Foundation (1 thing I love about you)
* Pike Place Market (sleepless in seattle tiramisu edition)
* Highway 99's famous motels

You will not see:

* The Fremont Troll
* The University of Washington (21 and over)
* Capitol Hill (singles)
* Ducks

"I've used Munchery 3-4 times. I was actually pretty surprised by the quality, it's generally very good. There are some misses, so just make sure to read the reviews and gauge based on your tastes (best thing I've had was the salmon with orzo). The nutrition info is right there in the app so you know what you're getting into. Some options are much healthier than others. The problem I have with Muchery is the price...you have to pay a delivery fee (think it's like $3 or so). There's also a tip field. They claim that they pay their drivers a living wage and tipping is not required. But tipping is ingrained in me...so I still do it. So after you get your ~$10 meal it can end up being $18 or so. It's more cost-effective to get a couple meals at once for that reason. I do think the meals themselves are reasonably priced for the quality. It's just the overhead of the fee that bugs me.

I will say though, it feels good to eat a ""real"" meal with minimal effort. Basically you can reheat at 325 in the oven for 10-15 minutes or microwave for a minute or two. Generally each meal has a main and a side or two. There's a couple options, you can schedule your delivery if you order before a certain time. The whole reason I use the service is for when I won't have time to cook (usually unexpected), so I haven't done that. The other option is ""asap"" delivery where they give you a time estimate before you order. For me that's been a ""worst case"" and it's generally come 10-15 minutes earlier (ymmv of course).

There's a ton of packaging though, which feels wasteful. Most of it can be composted if that makes you feel better. It would be nice if there was a way to reuse containers.

"I recommend taking care of it yourself. Here are a few reasons why.

1.) You help save your community a ton of money by not having a person come and pick up a dead animal. Instead of picking up road kill, that person can instead be utilized to fill potholes, clear fallen branches, and other items that are typically more expensive or time-intensive for a normal citizen.

2.) You help improve the quality of your immediate community. Imagine if every one of your neighbors took personal action any time they saw something wrong or in need of repair. How proud would you be if you could tell your friends back home, ""This place is great, whenever something breaks, one of us is there to protect our neighborhood. I picked up a dead raccoon, my neighbor cleaned the spilled trash from the crows, my other neighbor picked up all the litter around the lake, we all do our part to make this a great place to live!!""

3.) It'll feel great being proactive! You did something no one else has the stomach or willpower to do themselves! That's amazing and worth commendation!

4.) The five minutes it'll take to clean it up yourself will save you from ever having to think about this again. It's been a week now it's out there; how time much have you spent thinking about the raccoon? How many times did it make your walk unpleasant? How much time was spent contacting the city by phone or downloading the app and submitting requests? How much time could you have saved yourself if you just bagged it and dumped it on your own?

"I'm a rather radical leftist, so from my perspective Seattle is actually a fairly moderate/conservative city, at least on economic issues. Our city is driven by trade and corporate capital, Microsoft, Amazon, Starbucks, Costco, Boeing, etc. These companies would not thrive in this state if not for business-friendly policies, low taxes, and other incentives. So if you are a big fan of free trade, corporate capitalism, and low income taxes, Seattle is actually not that crazy for you. Also if you hate mass transit, we seem to be trending toward more light rail, but we also have a tradition of voting against public transit. 

The harder part is if you are a social conservative. You don't have to travel far from Seattle to be surrounded by social conservatives (anywhere 2 hours N, E, or S) and as others have said, people from all backgrounds and beliefs come to Seattle to express themselves freely and with less judgment. Still we aren't perfect... but I'm not exactly sure what you are looking for politically in terms of representation. 

Seattle might be far to the left for you, but if you check out any of the suburbs you may find many people and politicians who share your views. I think many on this thread are bothered by the rhetoric that Ted Cruz uses, more than his views per se because Washingtonians prefer a more cordial approach to politics. But go to Lewis County, Eastern Washington, Lynden, or Forks and plenty of people are probably proud Cruz supporters.

The people with lots of money will always have options, and reducing the number of options won't make them leave. What you have to do, if you want to keep the people with more money from driving out the people with less money, is exactly the opposite of what you suggested: the city needs to severely *liberalize* zoning for fancy new condos/apartments, so that developers can go crazy competing for all the new tech money, which means the high-wage people will have plenty of options, which means they won't have to bid up the rates on older, cheaper apartments and houses, which means people who aren't making high wages can continue to afford living here.

The basic problem is that our economy is doing well, which means that companies are hiring more workers, which means that more people are moving here, but our restrictive zoning codes prevent developers from building new apartments as quickly as new people are arriving.

"* Seattle Neighborhoods
  * Green Lake

**General description**
  
I’ve always written it Greenlake, but the map says Green Lake, so I’ve been wrong my whole life.

Green Lake is the area around Green Lake (duh), and is bordered by 99 on the west and I-5 on the east, 85th to the north and 60th to the south.  Very residential, primarily houses, although recent development has brought a lot of apartments to the north end of the lake.  Residents are generally rich older people or young, affluent people in yoga pants or non-pleated khaki shorts. 

Median Home Value: $624,600 (up 10% year over year)

Green Lake used to have a dairy distribution center on the north end, but that was torn down and left as a gaping open pit for a decade, then turned into mixed-use buildings, including a PCC and additional parking.  If you don’t like that PCC, don’t worry because there’s another one 1.2 miles to the west.  No, seriously.  That’s how affluent Green Lake is – it needed two PCCs to supply the necessary volume of organic kale.

It’s a nice neighborhood.  If you’re moving to Seattle and don’t want to be downtown, it’s one of the prestige neighborhoods.

**The Lake**  
[Green Lake Park]( http://www.seattle.gov/parks/park_detail.asp?id=307) includes a wide band of grass surrounding the lake.  It’s where the beautiful people go when the sun comes out because there’s plenty of real estate.

There’s also a great wading pool, tennis courts, a baseball field, a public pool, and lake swimming when the MRSA-laced algae isn’t blooming.

There are two trails around Green Lake.  The inner trail is paved and 2.8 miles long.  It’s perfect for riding your bike too fast like an asshole while dodging people walking and for jogging in the bike lane like assholes.

The outer trail is not paved and is 3.2 miles.  It’s perfect for taking your shirt off and running to show drivers and people on the inner path what lazy slobs they are.

**Walking**  
Green Lake has a decent [walk score]( https://www.walkscore.com/WA/Seattle/Green_Lake) for Seattle, but like many neighborhoods it concentrates all the action in a couple pockets – the area that houses PCC and [Tangletown]( https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=Green+lake+tangletown).


The commute to downtown is easy, with a quick ride down 15th on the RapidRide E Line, and there’s a Park and Ride with direct buses to the east side.  (but we have established that west side is best side)

**Farmers Market**  
Technically?  Yes there is a [Greenlake Farmers Market]( http://www.greenlakefarmersmarket.com/index.html), but they spell it the way dumb people like I do, are in the parking lot of a vape shop, and aren’t what you’re thinking of as a farmer’s market.

Also, why aren't you at PCC?  They miss you and are threatening to build a third one in the middle of the lake.

**Schools**  
The local public school is [Green Lake Elementary]( http://sps.ss8.sharpschool.com/UserFiles/Servers/Server_543/File/Migration/Schools/School%20Directory/Departmental%20Content/siso/schoolreports/2012/SchoolReport_2012_229.pdf), and most recent scores show that smart affluent people raise smart affluent children with above average scores and 19% free/reduced lunch.

The district feeds to [Roosevelt High School]( http://sps.ss8.sharpschool.com/UserFiles/Servers/Server_543/File/District/Departments/Schools/Roosevelt%20Data%20Summary/017.pdf), which again shows above average test scores.

**Notable local businesses**  
Food/Restaurants/Bakeries

* [The Butcher and the Baker](https://www. butcherbakerseattle.com) (sandwiches, charcuterie and other meats)
* [Latona Pub](http://3pubs.com/latona.html) (beer and what one reviewer called “bomb dot com food.”  are we really using that?)
* [The Woodlands](http://woodlandspizza.com) (beer, wood-fired pizza, and a friendly owner)

"As a black man living in this town, I must say I have mixed feelings about this. On one hand I'm a fan of Sen. Sanders knowing him mostly from the ""brunch with Bernie"" segment on the Thom Hartmann show. I agree with him 99% of the time on issues. Would police brutality and race race relations improve with Sanders as president? I honestly don't know, but I'm confident at least that it wouldn't get any worse. 

My feelings when I watched a raw video of those two young ladies going on stage was that of unease. It made me nervous seeing two people who may or may not bet part of the official BLM movement (this seems to be in dispute on Facebook) just get on stage and pretty much ""wing it"". It also seems like more ""established"" civil right groups there at the meeting where also sideblinded, including the NAACP and a speaker that also claimed to be speaking for BLM (which is an actual organization btw, they're main complaint these days is one of intellectual property). 

But what really made me nervous, and this may be that I'm 35 now and and just have my cynicism baked into me at this point, was the potential of having white liberals ""pissed off"". Look stakes are high for me, I literally live in a country where a cop can shoot me for no decent reason. I'm terrified. I use a e-cigarette and sometimes (I shit you not) I'm afraid of taking out with me because some freaked out cop may think I'm holding a weapon and decide to ""control the situation"". I have thoughts about this and no American should have to. 

Yeah so stakes are high, but I know that shit probably won't change without white involvement. And outside libertarians (maybe), I doubt  conservatives will rally to the cause, so that leaves white liberals. 

But here is my opinion regarding white liberals, they are a fickle bunch. They are awesome allies to minority and civil rights causes as long as it's on their time and on their schedule. And never ever piss them off, because if white liberals feel an inch disrespected they will at the least disconnect from the cause and at worse turn on minorities completely.

Not to say that's what happening on this thread, seems like everyone's ire is concentrated on these women activists (perhaps a bit too personal for my taste but this is reddit), but I've seen it happen. I heard a white liberal women say she's ""done""  with the BLM issue because of how she felt disrespected over an argument she had with someone over the ""Cecil the lion""  issue being co opted by some BLM activists (I don't condone that btw, lions shouldn't be killed for sport and it's an important issue). But yeah she felt slighted and ""quit"" being concerned about people being murdered for no reason. And she could walk away, because this is not happening to her or her family, she could go back to her world and not be effected in the slightest. 

I don't know these women at all, seems like some of you do. I've been in this town long enough to know some people are ""hobby""  activists or do it to be in the scene, without having any experience or skill at it. I also know that the issue these women claim to be representing is dead serious and there are scared folk out there. I just hope, really hope that just because two overtly enthusiastic activists interrupted your time with Uncle Bernie is not enough for you to turn your back on the BLM movement. No disrespect of course. ",false,false,t1_ctwhvpq,jeromewoody,First Hill,0,1439087783,t5_2qhad,t3_3gadbz,t3_3gadbz,118,1440367622,0,1,ctwhvpq,Seattle,118,,flair

"Waking up before the sun does suck, which is why I aim for as late a work schedule as I can swing.

Other than that, I *like* dressing up. I like having lots of layers of clothing and still feeling comfortable/cool. I know a lot of people (probably such as yourself) prefer to wear as little as they can get away with until the weather forces them to put on more; at least, it's the only explanation I have for people who wear T-shirts and shorts in the 60s. Conversely, I'm happier wearing jackets until the weather just gets too hot for them. I'll wear my light jacket right up into the high 70s, or 80s if it's cloudy.

I can be sitting in my room in just my skin, with a fan pointed right at me, and still sweat uncomfortably (doing so right now, in fact).

[Identity Politics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_politics) comes into play on both sides, and by definition, it's a world view that divides humanity into ""us"" and ""them"". Not necessarily us vs them but it tries to put everyone into a box.

Now the conservatives, have their tribes, but outside of actual blatant racists (the left has theirs too), most of the tribes are ideological, nationalism, culture (whatever the fuck that means exactly), religion, etc. These are things that you can be part of just by agreeing with them. If you accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior, you are in that tribe even if you're blue. You follow the rules, get your citizenship and embrace (at least their definition of) being American, and now you're in that tribe. 

The left has embraced identity politics too, but in terms that are defined ""by nature"". Black, white, gay, straight, LGBTQ, etc. These are not things you just wake up and decide to do differently (recent Spokane example aside). While the intention is good, the result is a world view that forces people into boxes that they have no way out of, whether they want to be defined that way or not. Over the years, I watched gay become LG, then LGB, then LGBT, then LGBTQ. Instead of adding one letter after another to an acronym, why not just add the whole damn alphabet and go back to seeing each other as simply humans. 

The left seems to be compelled to put everyone in their natural born box, a box not defined by the person being put in it and an inherently tribal concept, and then tries to assemble it into an mosaic, but at the end of the day, you are still chopping up humanity into us and them in a manner that takes away the individuals power to define themselves. IMHO, this is counter productive to seeing people a just people, even if that is ultimately your goal. Right destination, wrong path.

Again, not that the right is not tribal, but their tribes tend to be ideological, rather than innate.

tldr; Identity politics based on innate characteristics, is inherently and unshakably tribal, or to fall back on the unassailable words of Morgan Freeman ""Stop talking about it.

"Here's what I don't get.  The basis he uses for saying this is that the cities aren't as religious as he'd prefer, presumably the Mormon (which he converted to I believe) or Christian religions in particular.  But either way, one of the main guys he's supposed to be following, Jesus, repeatedly set an example of spending time with sinners and the downtrodden, people that the uber-religious folk of his day (the Pharisees) called uncleaned and shunned.  As a result, the Pharisees said he was ""a glutton and a drunkard, and a friend of tax collectors and other sinners"" (NLT).

On top of that, Jesus repeatedly called out the uber-religious class for being too proud, and left a message with his followers to go out into all the world.  His main two commandments were to love God and love your neighbor.  In describing who your neighbor is, he tells the famous parable of the Good Samaritan.  There was heated, long-term tension and hatred between the Jewish people and Samaritans, and yet Jesus chose a story where the Samaritan turns out to be the good guy who helps the injured man.

Those who came immediately after Jesus were quick to start breaking down the walls between what was considered the chosen people and the gentiles (pretty much the opposite of walling yourself off against people who you traditionally don't agree with).

"According to [this](http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/burying-power-lines-is-it-worth-the-cost/) article in the Seattle Times, there are approximately 10,000 miles of unburied powerlines in the area served by Puget Sound Energy (PSE), although a higher percentage are above ground in Seattle. Lets estimate that there are ~2,000 miles of unburied powerlines in Seattle. There are probably more.

According to [this wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undergrounding), underground cable costs between $20-$40 per foot in open area, and 10x as much in highly urbanized areas. An average estimate gives us $300/ft to bury powerlines in Seattle.

$300/ft * 3,000 miles * 5,280 ft/mile ~= $3,000,000,000 

An order of magnitude estimate shows that it will cost in the billions of dollars to bury powerlines in Seattle, not including the cost of removal of the old lines.

"I am all for asking ""silly questions"", because I truly buy into the idea that if one person has a question so do others and more so, transparency is best such that people should have their questions answers. However, that doesn't mean their aren't silly questions. To ignore a questions form being silly (e.g. ""does God have feet"") is a kin to ignoring that obese people are fat which is to say their is something unhealthy about dressing up the reality.

It is a ""silly question"" and I entertained it to the degree my physical understandings allowed (where no others did -- important fact to consider). Meteorologists aren't going to touch this and firefighting specialists aren't either, simply because neither of these experts understands the other and it takes both sets of knowledge, as outlined in the physics described, not only do you need a good prediction of the weather as I described, you also need a good understanding of the burn zones as they currently are with their temperatures which is pretty certainly data we don't have (firefighters aren't doctors, they don't go into these burn zones just to take a ""temperature""). But back to it being silly and not the irony that I am downvoted to kingdom come because I answered a silly question. It's silly because of this:

&gt; Is the rain expected to make a material impact in the fires?

Of course.

&gt; Are the fire departments predicting a reduction in the smoke/haze from as a result of this weather system?

Of course.

The question isn't asking if their is an impact which should be assumed given any basic understanding of the physics at hand but rather what degree and if that degree will be ""helpful"" to the firefighters. Again this is why the question isn't being answered because those who have depth in one area do not have the depth in the other and experts don't like silly questions nor questions they cannot fully answer (as they are suppose to be experts). The question was self-defeating and I answered it only be more defeated because no one here sees the complexity of the problem and inhibition of those to answer it nor the problem with the question itself, which is to say a more meaningful question is, ""to what degree will the rain impact the fires and to what degree will it improve air quality"".

First day were people from all walks of life, second day about the same, fast forward a week and westlake had an over abundance of tweekers, creepers, socially awkward, and very few people who were there the first two days. The fights for the mic, always, someone claiming they ran occupy, constant, and the people who really were the 99% couldn't identify with any of the folks claiming to be speaking for all. Same thing here, I'm about as anti racist as a person can be, I've done many things to educate folks on stopping racism. That said, what they did, shoving the elderly, letting someone who supported them 110% get shoved to the side so they could talk, sorry, insult the audience. That has zero to do with any anti racist movement. Part of learning how to stop racism is listening to those who hate. Listening to those who's opinions are different than yours means letting them go first. The women there had no interest in hearing him. They could have asked him questions and had him answer in front of everyone and press, then could have had a back and forth if needed.

"I agree and think that you raise good points. Here is my rebuttal:

1. I would say that tent cities are cyclical in nature, they both attract more homeless to the area but are also a result of a high population of homeless in the area. Typically, homeless people are already attracted to areas with opportunity (work, drugs, shelter, food) which tend to be urban centers. Having a tent city is not necessarily the reason why you have out of city/state homeless. While I can see your point that it may help bring others in, I would also argue that there are a number of factors leading to migration.
2. When you have centralization, while it may exacerbate the situation, it also makes it easier to target care and assistance effectively. Rather than having social workers trawl across the city looking for people who are on programs (because they were kicked out of their encampment), workers can make visits and check ups more easily if there is a defined location. I'm not arguing that tent cities and encampments are a solution, I'm saying that the null case (leave them be) is a better alternative than kicking them out.

Yes, marijuana is legal in Washington ([I-502](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Initiative_502)).  You can only purchase it from a [retail store](http://www.liq.wa.gov/publications/Public_Records/2015-MJ%20Applicants/MarijuanaApplicants080415.xls).  Stores are limited to 8AM-12AM, but can have different hours within that window.

In its first year it generated about $52 million in excise taxes, but that number is rising, and will likely more than double in 2015.  Originally, the money was earmarked for health care, drug abuse treatment, and a small amount to research, however the Legislature has already begun re-appropriating the majority of the expected funds to the general fund (education).

* **Smoke and drive?**  Not if your delta-9 levels are over 5 ng/mL.  Concentrations can vary greatly depending on the individual, so good luck with that.

"The article felt exactly right to me. I interned there, and I remember putting in 12 hour days on the weekend while my friends who interned at Microsoft actually got to have a life (and a pretty kickass one actually). Working in the fast paced environment was exhilarating, the people were fantastic, and the work was challenging. But I remember ending my internship feeling utterly exhausted, sick, and having lost 15 pounds while not exercising. I then spent the next month interviewing so I didn't have to accept Amazon's offer, and I so very happy I didn't go back.

&gt;  I CHOOSE to work somewhere that demands a lot from me intellectually. WHY IS THAT WRONG?

I refuse to accept that there is a choice between having an intellectually challenging job and having a good life outside of work. I currently work with interesting people on interesting problems that challenge me intellectually without sacrificing my health and life. I can leave work at 6 and not have my boss ask why I am leaving early. I can ignore work email on the weekend. I can take vacations and not bring my laptop. I can do all that in my personal life while still having a huge impact, getting a ton of satisfaction out of the job, and working on very interesting and challenging problems.

It is very obvious that Amazon does not invest in its employees and that it does not view them as a long term asset. If Amazon did, they would offer things like paid parental leave. They would have policies in place to prevent people from getting placed on a PIP after dealing with familial or health problems. They wouldn't invade your life. You just need to look at the retention rate. 18 months after I left my internship, the team of 13 people I was on did not have a single person left on it who was on the team when I interned. A 100% turnover rate in 18 months is stunningly bad almost everywhere, but fairly typical from what I saw at Amazon.

"KCSO doesn't have the special review board, but they do have arbitration for disputes like this, which can result in disciplinary decisions the sheriff makes being overturned. I believe one of the big controversies about SPD is that they have two separate disciplinary review processes, as opposed to the one KCSO has.

Here's an [example:](http://mynorthwest.com/76/2338227/King-County-Sheriff-defends-demoting-not-firing-troubled-sergeant)

&gt;But it's far from the first time Saulet has been in trouble. He was demoted in 2008 for another ""courtesy violation,"" but an arbitrator overturned the demotion.

It also appears that the KCPOG must vote to support a member in arbitration [they so choose:](http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/union-wont-support-deputy-fired-over-jail-beating/)

&gt;After that, Schene set about trying to get his job back. To do that, he’d have to go to arbitration, a process in which he’d need the support of the King County Police Officers Guild, according to sheriff’s spokesman Sgt. John Urquhart.

I don't think SPOG has that option. I think they are required to represent all members, legally speaking.

That's probably why Urquhart doesn't worry too much about just axing deputies. He can fire them, then if the union decides to back them in arbitration, it makes them look like the bad guys.

edit: from the article you linked, you can see Urqhart talk about the process:

&gt;Urquhart said when he makes a decision to fire someone, ""it doesn't concern me whether I lose or win at arbitration."" Many of the officers he's fired throughout his term so far can still appeal—some of them are doing so, in fact—and possibly win their jobs back.

I was just thinking of my past year here, and sure not everything here is perfect, but it also seems like Seattle doesn't pretend to be perfect, and just tries to do its best (which is pretty amazing). 

For me, the weather is amazing, the people are fine (I'm sort of a anti-social cynic, but the people here are too bad usually) and a lot of things are beautiful (even when they smell like piss here in pioneer square, but hey, where else do you expect some of these people to pee?

I mean, I really liked living in Tucson Arizona because the people were pretty chill, but they seem pretty chill here (just maybe a touch distant at times), and the weather and relative lack of bugs is pretty awesome. The scenery is beautiful as well, obviously.

"&gt;the mayor decried hookah lounges as hotspots of violence

Bold sentiment. Surely, there's evidence that's not just loosely packed rhetoric which supports this.

&gt; While police have not officially connected the July 23 murder of Donnie Chin to a hookah lounge, Murray and others tied this new effort to the killing of Chin

I'd have been tased out of logic 101 at the UW with this argument. But I guess it's good enough for public policy. There has to be more than this though...


&gt; Chin was shot in the same block as King’s Hookah Lounge in the Chinatown-International District

He was shot in the lou----

Oh, the hookah lounge was on the same block. Why aren't the other shops being targeted with this rhetoric though?

&gt; His death was one of three murders in the last 18 months that have occurred near smoking lounges, according to the mayor's office.

"The law seems to agree that this is discrimination. Her story is basically the inverse of the regulation below (part of the US Family Medical Leave Act): 

&gt;(c) The Act's prohibition against interference prohibits an employer from discriminating or retaliating against an employee or prospective employee for having exercised or attempted to exercise FMLA rights. For example, if an employee on leave without pay would otherwise be entitled to full benefits (other than health benefits), the same benefits would be required to be provided to an employee on unpaid FMLA leave. By the same token, employers cannot use the taking of FMLA leave as a negative factor in employment actions, such as hiring, promotions or disciplinary actions; nor can FMLA leave be counted under no fault attendance policies. See§ 825.215.

Source:
[https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/29/825.220](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/29/825.220)

Also, the ""other than health benefits"" is mentioned above because [this FMLA section](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/29/825.209) specifically says:
&gt;During any FMLA leave, an employer must maintain the employee's coverage under any group health plan (as defined in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 at 26 U.S.C. 5000(b)(1)) on the same conditions as coverage would have been provided if the employee had been continuously employed during the entire leave period. 

So it's like Amazon read the provisions above, and did literally the exact opposite. Immediately after she exercised FMLA leave, they took her health insurance benefits (by ""accident"") and then put her on disciplinary action.

"I love Seattle, but I miss the open mindedness and diversity of SF (where I lived until my mid-20s, I'm in my early 30s now) and the incredible warmth of Chicago where I lived for a few years. If I had the energy, or if my wife died, I would move back to SF. People are just so much more friendly and open minded down there.

Over the last few years I've really struggled to feel comfortable with making friends in Seattle. It's like if I make an off-color joke here, or simply fumble with my words, or if I admit to people I like to get stoned or drink booze I'll be reported to the Seattle social ""HR"" and never be invited to another activity with people I'm trying to bond with and get to know. I went on a hike here and brought a backpack full of beer. When we got to the look-out point I offered them up and everyone looked at me like I shit my pants. I don't even like beer!

In SF, everyone high fives everyone. Things feel a bit more conservative here. I think having so many people migrate here from small-towns in Montana, Idaho, Alaska and central Washington contributes to it.

Someone in the thread mentioned the rights on red problem.  Someone going slowly through an intersection, clear lane ahead, and boom, some dick turns right on a red and that space is gone.  Also the amount of people I saw switching lanes in the middle of an intersection was ridiculous.  Once again you could have a person maintaining their lane through an intersection and then getting cut off by one or more drivers and, once again, ending up blocking the intersection.  A still picture of someone blocking an intersection gives absolutely no context as to how they ended up there.  Also, a little side note, if your bus is late don't get on the fucking bus and start telling the bus driver how late he or she is or asking them why they are late or asking ""Derrrrr where was the 5:00 bus, why didn't it show up?"".

"Things are different now from the early days. I remember when everyone was cordial, constructive, and intelligent.  I remember when people would do the right thing for the business and the customers.   People at the company are increasingly not that way.  They are doing what is right for themselves first.  This is not surprising.  This is a natural outcome.

A lot of the leadership principles worked effectively to build a good company culture in the early days. Even stack ranking was useful back in the days when Amazon was smaller, had less employer heft, and a subset of hires were not capable of doing their job effectively.

Now they hire very good engineers, the teams are uniformly solid, but they still must rank and yank. 

That perverts the performance management process.  If there are no genuinely low performers, but you still have to fire some people every year, you quickly end up with a lot of perverse behavior where everyone is constantly seeking their own advantage over their co-workers just to keep their jobs.  They will not only screw over their co-workers, they will screw over the business as well, if it is what is necessary to stay on the job.

I've seen the culture become increasingly corrosive over the years.  It's destroying the company from the inside.  You can't have a successful company if your business' interests and your employee's interests don't align.

"Current Amazonian. Never seen anyone cry. Never heard anyone say ""Amabot"" (we prefer ""Amazombie"" in my part of the business). Pretty much everything else looks accurate to me. I've been there a year and a half, and the place sucks. Currently applying for jobs to escape. 

Something the article fails to grasp is that all that ""disagree and commit"" shit goes right out the window when it's something Jeff Bezos wants (or, as we know him adoringly, ""Jeff""). Pretty sure that's how the trainwreck that was the Fire phone came about. Jeff wanted it, and no one wanted to say no to the man. And how could they--the place actively encourages a cult of personality around the man (swear to god, Bezos quotes are written on the wall in the building where new employee orientation happens). He is the Thulsa Doom to their snake cult.

A lot of people hate the place, and are doing their time like me. If you're lucky, one of these people will be your manager.

As indicated by the comments on this thread, a lot of people there have had very different experiences, including very positive ones. I don't want to discount these people as corporate shills. One of the best people I ever worked with seems to love it there. She was incredibly demanding, but also gave a fuck about you as a person. Though she wasn't my manager, she was one of the few people who bothered to ""develop"" me, to use the corporate parlance, after I started, and I learned a lot from her. 

Ultimately, the place is decentralized as fuck--sometimes shit feels like we're the Maquis in Nazi-occupied France--and your experience will depend a huge degree on the people you work with. That said, the overarching company culture is still going to get to you. Some people thrive in that shit, and good for them. Some of them seem to be genuine sociopaths, serial killers in another life, and some are decent people whose personalities just lend themselves toward that kind of situation. And then a lot of us are underpaid, overworked and doing our time till something better comes along (please, please let it be soon). 

I will say that, even though I hate the place, I've learned a fuckload there, and gotten experience that I never would've gotten at another place at my relatively low level.

"**MISC - Cable &amp; Internet**

*The big carriers*

**Important Point:** Bad as you might want it to be so, there is currently almost no ISP competition in Seattle.  What serves your residence is what you get.  Posting a sorrowful thread about how crappy Comcast is and ohpleasecan'ttherebesomeoneelse will do little to soothe your pain, so choose your new abode wisely if Internet service is important to you.

Seattle has two main cable companies serving it, [Comcast](http://www.comcast.com/) and [Wave Broadband](http://www.wavebroadband.com/).  You can find out which one serves your area by looking at the [cable franchise boundaries map](http://www.seattle.gov/cable/franchises.htm) (it's a large PDF so I've linked to the city page that links to it).  Notice that they only overlap in some *small* areas.  Very generally, Wave is the exclusive provider in the Central District, Judkins Park, and Yesler Terrace along with the Beacon Hill / Columbia City area between IH-5 and Beacon Ave S.  Wave and Comcast overlap in *portions of* Capitol Hill, Belltown, and West Queen Anne.  Everywhere else in the city is Comcast territory.

* Comcast is, well, Comcast.  Lots of folks have decent to good experiences with them but several people have horror stories to go along with what you've undoubtedly read.  Watch your bills, do not use autopay, and try to sign up online if at all possible.  Buy your own cable modem to save the $8-$10/month rental fee.  Promos change monthly.  Speeds range from 5Mbps to 500Mbps and, as of right now, Comcast doesn't offer their ""2Gbps Professional"" service here.  Their TV service is exactly what you would expect.

* Wave is a small cable company that at least has local management.  Inside Seattle, they took over for a previous company that was liked even less than Comcast and their network reflects this.  They've been working diligently to upgrade it and most of their service are in Seattle is good.  Speeds go from 5Mbps to 110Mbps download and 1Mbps to 10Mbps upload.  Wave has a data transfer cap that it **absolutely** enforces.  On their highest residential package, 110Mbps/10Mbps, you will be able to transfer up to 1TB of data (upload and download are added together) included.  More than this costs extra.  Wave does have TV service, will lease you a TiVo for your DVR box, and TV Everywhere services are generally available.  Mind that data cap, however.

* [CenturyLink](http://www.centurylink.com/) is the incumbent telephone company.  They are deploying a fiber-to-the-home network that--as of the end of July, 2015--is available in *portions of* the Central District, Montlake, Capitol Hill, Beacon Hill, Columbia City, Rainier Valley, West Seattle, Ravenna, Ballard, Loyal Heights, Crown Hill, Lake City, and Northgate.  More areas are coming online, so do check.  CenturyLink's definitions of a ""neighborhood"" do not necessarily follow the city's, nor are all areas within a neighborhood serviced.  Most apartment complexes are--again, as of this writing--not served.  You have a much better shot of getting fiber if you are in a freestanding house, a townhouse/rowhouse, or a small apartment building.  They are rolling out their TV service, called Prism TV, to both DSL and fiber customers, provided your residence can get a minimum of 20Mbps of download.  Many residences max out at 7Mbps DSL, so be careful when ordering.  **Edit**: On 18 August, GeekWire posted [this map of gigabit availability](http://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/8-17SEATTLE_cmyk-620x1079.jpg) inside Seattle.

(Potential CenturyLink customers not inside Seattle, see below.)

How do you know if you can get CenturyLink fiber, Comcast, or Wave? You **go to their websites** and plug in your address.  Do *not* believe a walk-up salesperson.  For example, many CenturyLink sales people like to call their fiber-to-the-end-of-the-street service ""real fiber.""  It is pretty good but usually limited to 40Mbps service.  If you go to CenturyLink's website and it does not show 1Gbps as available at your address, you will not be receiving fiber-to-the-home, no matter what the salesperson tells you.

*The small upstarts*

* [CondoInternet](http://www.condointernet.net/) is the most well-known of the ""specialty"" ISPs serving Seattle.  Previously independent, they are now owned by Wave Broadband and the branding for the service is changing.  Visit their website to find a list of buildings they serve, both within and without Seattle.  Virtually everyone who has their service loves it to pieces and genuinely regrets moving to a new place that lacks it.  Reviews are solid.

* [CascadeLink](http://cascadelink.com/) has an identical offering but is in different buildings.

Their speeds are low and their prices moderate, but you will have the thrill of buying Internet from one of the smallest operations you've ever encountered.

*The Eastside and Beyond*

Since we're mentioning the other towns around here, it's only fair to mention [Frontier Communications](http://frontier.com/).  They bought Verizon's network here in 2010/2011 and have continued operating it.  Inside *all or part of* Redmond, Kirkland, Bothell, Woodinville, Shoreline, Lake Forest Park, Everett--ok, you know what, I'm gonna stop listing cities and say that more or less every city that touches IH-405, highway 520, and IH-5 north of Seattle up to Marysville--you can find Frontier FiOS.  Speeds go up to 100Mbps and promotions change almost whimsically so check back often.  Frontier is the only provider for whom you should **not** trust their website and should call.  Even better, if you live in an apartment building, go ask your front office if Frontier FiOS is available.  They will probably know better than Frontier's sales staff.  If you live in a house or small apartment building, look for a white, grey, or tan box at least 12 inches square hanging around outside on some of your neighbors' houses; that's usually a fiber optic terminal and means you can get FiOS.  If you have a ""choice"" of Frontier DSL, Comcast, or getting kicked in the head repeatedly, take Comcast over the kick in the head...but just barely.  Frontier has TV but it's *spendy*.

If you live south of Seattle along IH-5 or highway 167, you're probably getting Comcast or CenturyLink DSL.  CenturyLink has fiber optic service in a *tiny* slice of places like Issaquah and Sammamish but they don't do Gigabit service in those cities and, so far as I have seen, have not extended fiber to anywhere on the south side.",false,false,t1_ctws9rm,somenewuser,Central Area,0,1439119403,t5_2qhad,t3_3g4tkt,t3_3g4tkt,21,1440372582,0,1,ctws9rm,Seattle,21,,flair

BLM isn't a monolithic organized institution. It is a rallying cry used by diffuse groups and individual protesters around the country.

Majority public opinion didn't give a damn about Black Lives Matter or the issues they're pressing in the first place. This is why people started this rallying cry and putting together grassroots protests. The mainstream opinion (as evidenced in this sub) wasn't doing anything to support their cause, so different people used this rallying to gain momentum/ attention for a cause most people didn't care about.

In practice none of this is true.

But you never have the time or resources to actually fix up the messes that anyone before you made, because there's always something else that's higher priority that has to get done.

"As a daily car commuter who carpools into Downtown/Pioneer Square to take my wife to work and my toddler to day care, cab drivers are the scariest thing to me as a driver.  

This is true on all roads due to a wanton disregard of all other living things within a 100 ft radius of their cab.  However this is especially true on the waterfront and even more so when a ferry or cruise ship is unloading.  A dozen cabs from every possible company lined up, cab drivers just standing around, running across 4 lanes of traffic without looking because, hey, they know that other cab driver across the street so why not cause drivers to slam on their brakes to avoid killing a cab driver so they can shoot the shit for 3 minutes before darting back across the road. 

Another classic is the ""Shit, I parked on the wrong side of the street because, look, all the people are now over there.  Well, fuck it, I'm going to whip a shitty from this parking space across all lanes just to sit and wait for another potential customer!  However, to make it more entertaining for myself, I'm going to start out really fast and then slam on my brakes for no reason part way through the turn(but only if I'm blocking more than one lane of traffic) then I'ma creep forward until I'm almost in the space I wanted but, because I'm horrible at physics and time and being a responsible driver, I'm going to only pull 2/3rds of the way into the new spot and then just say 'Job well done', pat myself on the back and then go back to staring at my phone while the ass end of my cab sticks out into the bike lane, if not fully into the full lane of traffic.  Shit driving is best driving, after all!""

Another one is the 'I'm going to ride your ass so hard, even though you're totally doing at least 5 mph over the speed limit.  At the least safe moment I'm going to swerve around you, gun it past you while giving you a look of soul-rending incredulity, cut you off with as little room as possible and then slam on the brakes right in front of you because HOLY SHIT someone is standing stationary on the sidewalk and that absolutely means the need a cab!'
