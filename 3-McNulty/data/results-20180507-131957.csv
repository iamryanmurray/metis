"Admittedly, I was disappointed with ST's plans to build light rail all the way to Everett when the ST3 draft was first released. I still think ST should give North Sounder a bit more attention, and Metro and Community Transit should have some feeder lines to Mukilteo and Edmonds. But what I missed initially is that the Link spine won't just be an intercity commuter service replicating North Sounder. There will be plenty of Everett-Lynnwood trips and Mountlake Terrace-Shoreline trips and everything in between.

Everett and Seattle today are distinct cities, separated by exurban cul-du-sacs and two-car households. But the Puget Sound region's population is projected to grow at a monumental rate over the next 20-30 years and not all of that growth will be concentrated in Seattle.

"&gt; There's also a strong ""reverse commute"" (with respect to the usual American style) driven by people who live in the city going out into the suburbs for their day jobs.

I was pondering this the other day. I may get ostracized for this (especially in this particular sub), but I think of the ""Seattle Metro Area"" as Seattle instead of just the city itself. Thus, when I think of ""Seattle"", I tend to include pretty much any city on Lake WA (Tukwila, Renton, Bellevue, Kirkland, and Kenmore). Hear me out!

**EDIT:** Maybe a better way to define my version of ""Seattle"" is anything within the I5-I405 circle. That also helps reinforce the point about traffic better.

Relatively speaking, Seattle is much smaller than comparable cities by population. According to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_cities_by_population), Seattle is #18 in population. But look at its square mileage compared to other cities:

Pop. # | City | Population | Sq. Mileage
-|-|-|-
16 | Fort Worth | 833,319 | 339.8
17 | Charlotte | 827,097 | 297.7
**18** | **Seattle** | **684,451** | **83.9**
19 | Denver | 682,545 | 153.0
20 | El Paso | 681,124 | 255.2

If we were to somehow expand the city limits out to surround Lake WA for a comparable square mileage (wild ass guess of 250sq. mi?), the population of ""Seattle"" becomes much much higher. A more salient point is that a lot of the traffic we currently think of as ""to/from the suburbs"" would become intra-city commuting, and thus no longer a 'reverse commute' to work in the 'suburbs'. This could partially explain why the traffic patterns aren't as predictable as one would expect.

Maybe I think this way because I fall in this bucket I've just described. I don't live or work in the Seattle city limits, but I do live and work in two cities that touch Lake WA, so my commute is very impacted/impactful to the overall ""Seattle"" traffic, despite never venturing into the city limits. I don't think of myself of as a reverse commuter at all.",,,,jazzyjayx,,,1472755935,t5_2qhad,t3_50np88,t1_d75hsgu,19,1475240257,0,0,d75qxd0,Seattle,19,,

"&gt;On the off chance you're not trolling

Disagreement = trolling? Well, you're off to a bad start. Let's see where this goes. My expectations are low.

&gt;If you're judging people for getting plastic surgery, that's your problem.

Hoo boy. I pity the people who are so uncomfortable in their own skin that they mangle their own appearance chasing after an image they can never achieve. You do too. You just won't admit it for the sake of argument. That's fine.

&gt;Nobody is talking about reassignment surgery re children in this article, so I'm not really sure what your point is here.

Sure, we're just talking about freezing boys' development, effectively stopping them from reaching adulthood. Their bones don't thicken, their muscles don't develop, their adult characteristics don't develop. What if we did this for girls? What if we froze women in a pre-puberty state? How would you feel about this? I would call it unnatural and abusive.

Not that it matters whether the plan is to modify their genitals now. The goal is to set them so far down the path of gender reassignment that they'll have no choice but to continue with it as adults. What hope is there for a perpetually pre-pubescent male?

What right does anyone have to do this to a child? Even if the child 'consents' to it, what adult would allow such a thing to happen? Puberty is the most important stage of development in a person's life, and we're screwing with it to legitimize a mental illness. Think about that.

&gt;Any halfway decent treatment for people struggling with gender identity has a mental health component.

Component, huh? It should be the full treatment. It is, after all, a mental illness.

&gt;Nobody really expects hormones or sexual reassignment surgery is going to fix everything like some medical miracle.

Then it shouldn't be done at all.

&gt;Everything you've said flies in the face of conventional medical wisdom

""First, do no harm"". It's the first tenet of medical wisdom.

&gt;I trust medical professionals more than I trust some random dude on reddit.

Cool, then I'm sure Michael Jackson's doctor, or Anna Nicole Smith's, or any pill-mill doctor can contradict my suggestion - Don't get hooked on pharmaceuticals. I guess it's good to know the infinite wisdom of a medical degree has now excused pill addictions.

So what do you do when medical doctors disagree with these procedures? You just doctor shop until you find one who comes up with a threadbare excuse to mess with your child's hormones. It's not like there are doctors out there whose entire careers are based on catering to the transgender community, right? Only a fool could construe a correlation between them and the pill mill docs. :)",,,,FartinLutherKingJr,,,1473371121,t5_2qhad,t3_51rzb0,t1_d7erqy8,13,1475466640,0,0,d7eskbs,Seattle,13,,

"Here's an answer to this problem that no one wants to hear:  Get the homeless population using drugs off them - using force and incarceration if necessary.

For some reason, the word 'compassion"" has been corrupted so that somehow people think it's okay for people to continue poisoning themselves and destroying their lives as long as we let them do it with a roof over their head where we don't have to look at them.   We need to rethink that.

Stoned people have no right to their own set of laws (one of which is that you shouldn't have things like crack and heroin.)   Getting hooked people straight would get them back to a place where they could actually hold down jobs or at least move to a place where something for them is available.  Frankly, you're handing them their life back - which is the right thing to do for them and for society at large.

No, it won't take care of the whole problem - but it will make it easier to address the mentally ill who make up a lot of the rest.

Yes, it will cost money - but if you present taxpayers with a proposal to get these people off drugs and help them restore their lives to something manageable vs more ""Hey, lets give these people free stuff so they can continue poisoning themselves and stealing bikes"" I think taxpayers would go for it.",,,,Issyquah,,,1473274895,t5_2qhad,t3_51l80z,t3_51l80z,30,1475423252,0,0,d7d5p0q,Seattle,30,,

"If you look at how various mayors have dealt with the problem over the last decade it's pretty clear that the advocates really don't want the mayor or council to interfere in their business.  As soon as the mayor or council do anything that isn't in line with the homeless services providers initiatives the political pressure is cranked up.  That's how we ended up with Nickelsvilles, why McGinn ended up clearing a camp then letting it fill right back up, and why we had dozens of SHARE protestors camped out at the KC administration building throwing poop at office workers.  The advocates want things done their way and that way isn't one that actually reduces homelessness or their funding.    

Then there's the other issue that the city/county sponsored tent camps (as well as the unsanctioned ones) are huge drug markets.  The dealers serving that population have a lucrative racket selling meth and heroin to the down and out.  TC4, a SHARE camp in Sammamish had one of their dealers busted.  He claimed that he had a clientele of 20-30 regular users he was supplying in the Tent City, and that he wasn't even the biggest dealer at the camp where 70% of the residents were addicted to either meth or heroin.

"Some years ago, our grill hadn't been cleaned out in ages. Like it had two years of crud and spider webs and junk in there.

It would burn absurdly hot, 700F-1000F at peak. It would go for three  to five hours at scary levels and then be hot damn near to the next morning.

Sterile grill, right? I actually did this once to that magnitude myself, in the same scenario as my dad. I don't know if it was good for the grill. It was one of those wider Texas style offset smoker/grill combos from Chargriller, the $150 lower end ones. It was kinda scary how it kept going. I also probably was stupid because we had a ton, like fifty, sixty old checkbooks saved over the decades (some from defunct banks) and I didn't want to sit and shred them all or put them in recycling. So I mixed them in the charcoal before ignition. Nothing but ashes when I opened the grill.

"Dude, I'm reading it right now. I don't see anywhere that excludes parks that the public uses. The only provision is around the definition of ""public space"" and ""specific public use"", in the definition section:

&gt;“Public space” means any area which is owned, leased, maintained, controlled, or managed by a government or public entity.

So, a park fits here.

&gt;“Specific public use” means a lawful designated and recognized function, including but not limited to park use, schools, and recreational areas. The City shall establish by Director’s rule the criteria for and a process by which the Department of Neighborhoods may define a “specific public use” for a particular location, for purposes of designating an “unsuitable location”.

So, the Department of Neighborhoods can use the definition ""specific public use"" to designate ""unsuitable locations"". What does that mean for unsanctioned campers? After the definitions, Section three has an excerpt (my bold):

&gt;Section 3. Removal and impoundment. The City may respond appropriately to emergency situations such as fires, crimes, or medical crises as it normally would outside outdoor living spaces. However, **except as specified in Section 4 of this ordinance**, the City may undertake a removal or impoundment action only when the City has satisfied the following conditions...

So nothing you can do except look for exceptions in Section 4. Let's take a look?

&gt;Section 4. Hazards and unsafe or unsuitable conditions

&gt;A. If an outdoor living space or a vehicle used as a residence is in an **unsafe or unsuitable location**, or creates or contains a hazardous condition, the City may undertake a removal or impoundment action if conducted in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section.

So it's clear that the only way a park is off limits is if it is designated as ""unsuitable"" through the use of ""specific public use"" definitions, and if you read Section 4 further, there are even 48 hour time limits there, too. So at minimum, even with a designation from the Department of Neighborhoods, campers are guaranteed 48 hours minimum in any public space that isn't on fire, in the middle of a gunfight, or experiencing a major medical issue.

Exactly what /u/ziznivypes was saying.

It's really shitty to just make up statements like they are fact when you clearly did *not* read the actual ordinance, or at minimum, did not understand it.

That's because it's their land, not yours. Fuck your cows the wolves have a rightful place to live there. 

You should be thinking of a solution to separate the cows and the wolves then. The solution isn't just mow them down and wipe your hands clean. 

Countless studies have shown that if humans didn't hunt the shit out of deer the wolves would rather prefer eating deer anyways.

http://www.capitalpress.com/Oregon/20151116/deer-and-elk-serve-as-a-buffer-to-livestock-attacks

But no, humans have to trophy hunt deer for ""muh tradition"". Even eating deer is fine, it's all the people that do it drive down deer populations.

I am absolutely not a know nothing city slicker. I studied this for 4 years at UC Davis and later UC Irvine. I've volunteered with 3 wolf sanctuaries and have spent the better part of 6 years invested in this. 

I've since moved from Irvine to Colorado. 


TL:DR, Wolves have a rightful place to be there, I state ranchers need to stop being violent hicks, provide ample sources and my own experience at UCI and wolf sanctuaries. ",,,,[deleted],,,1473464375,t5_2qhad,t3_51zhyh,t1_d7gbvfs,25,1475505031,0,0,d7gc95p,Seattle,25,,

"We are a destination for homeless people because we treat them well relative to the rest of the country, and it's nice here.  

&gt;For years, Oklahoma City tackled its homeless problem by handing out bus tickets to other cities to its down-and-out residents. But once the homeless arrived at their destination, they were often greeted with a new one-way bus ticket, as city leaders across the nation increasingly embraced the practice of busing out the poor, a solution that solved the immediate problem of reducing a municipality’s homeless crisis without actually finding housing for the needy. [source](http://www.ibtimes.com/homeless-bus-ticket-programs-across-nation-offer-little-accountability-poor-housing-2016812)

San Fran also has bought 10,000 one-way bus tickets to other cities, some of them end up here.

&gt;Over the past five years, Nevada's primary state psychiatric hospital has put hundreds of mentally ill patients on Greyhound buses and sent them to cities and towns across America.

&gt;Since July 2008, Rawson-Neal Psychiatric Hospital in Las Vegas has transported more than 1,500 patients to other cities via Greyhound bus, sending at least one person to every state in the continental United States, according to a Bee review of bus receipts kept by Nevada's mental health division. [source](http://www.sacbee.com/news/investigations/nevada-patient-busing/article2577189.html)

500 of those mental patients ended up in California, a couple hundred ended up in Oregon, nobody has access to the data to count how many went to Washington state.

&gt;Civic leaders in Portland, Oregon, want to start busing homeless people out of town. The city council there quietly set aside $30,000 to buy one-way tickets for certain homeless individuals last week, the Portland Mercury reports. [source](https://thinkprogress.org/oregon-just-set-aside-30-000-to-buy-the-homeless-one-way-bus-tickets-dc85fdb6eb01#.tchgt4pgs)

Portland set aside 30k/year to buy 1-way bus tickets to other cities, the first two bus tickets the bought for people were to Seattle and Spokane.

&gt;In November, KIRO 7 spoke to Teman Crawford **a twice-convicted felon** living on the streets of Seattle.

&gt;He said **police** in Oxnard, California, had gotten him a bus ticket to come to Seattle.“It was $116. They said it was a **once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.** **Don’t come back**,” Crawford said. 

&gt;When asked why he picked Seattle, Crawford said his friends had called this the “land of opportunity.’““

&gt;There’s a lot of angels up here. A lot of love. People buying people brand new tents, giving them blankets, putting food in their stomachs,” he said.

&gt;On Friday, a homeless man named Steve told KIRO 7 he was given a bus ticket to come to Seattle from Phoenix.

&gt;He said he told the Phoenix location of St. Vincent de Paul that he wanted to come to Seattle where he has relatives. They purchased the ticket for him, but he admits now he does not actually have family here.

&gt;Steve said he has a much better chance of surviving in Seattle, compared to Phoenix. He said he wanted a change in scenery, and he preferred the weather here. He added, “You can never starve in this town, everyone feeds you.” Seattle is the “land of opportunity” … [source](https://shiftwa.org/cities-buying-one-way-tickets-to-seattle-for-their-own-homeless/)

I drafted evidentiary reports, facilitated a countywide Reentry symposium, evaluated King County's adult detention programs, and co-developed an offender Risk-Need-Responsivity tool for correctional treatment-matching. He also led interdepartmental meetings with DAJD directors, DOC staff members, university professors, district court judges, and attorneys.

He currently serves as a Co-Chair on the Seattle Human Rights Commission, where he lead taskforces, draft letters, and support resolutions, specifically community-led initiatives to reduce juvenile detention and improve reentry services in Seattle. Through his recent educational and professional experiences, he brings a thorough understanding of how Seattle and King County's policies can assist the HRC in achieving its mission of eliminating discrimination and promoting human rights.

"That only applies in the District of Columbia. Each state is responsible for tort laws like this and the idea of duty of care under the 10th amendment.

For a good overview of how it works in WA, I'd suggest reading this response to petition from the WA State Supreme court: https://www.courts.wa.gov/content/petitions/90369-7%20Answer%20to%20Petition%20for%20Review.pdf

Basically if the police encounter a situation where there is no duty to rescue (as in there is no apparent crime _in progress_) they have no specific duty to you as an individual. You as an individual though are part of the greater public, which _they do have a duty to_. But because there is no crime taking place, or no appearance of a crime taking place (like in the case you mentioned, where the police were unable to see if a crime was taking place, despite taking all the required steps to investigate) they do not have a specific duty to you.

It is fairly complicated but it ultimately makes sense. If the police see a crime taking place and fail to act then it is a failure to uphold the duty to rescue exception of their duty to care. If not they can not reasonably be held responsible for things they can not legally gain knowledge of (like for example in the case you mentioned, police knocked on the door of the residence and drove around the residence, had they gone any further it would be a constitutional violation of the 4th amendment).",,,,NouberNou,Capitol Hill,,1473093065,t5_2qhad,t3_5198h1,t1_d7ad7er,21,1475356552,0,0,d7ae53g,Seattle,21,,flair

North Cascades Highway (SR20) - this one has a few viewpoint spots with large parking lots.

SR112 - Different kind of scenic (ocean-side), it's mostly a narrow two-lane road hugging the shoreline, I don't remember any viewpoint stops.

"Please please PLEASE adopt rather than buy. If you don't have a preference, it makes a huge difference. That said, I got my pup from Forgotten Dogs Rescue, a foster-based rescue that focuses on dogs at high risk of abuse or euthanasia...almost exclusively pitbulls. Follow them on Facebook (can't link to FB in /r/seattle but their handle is forgottendogsrescue) and you'll see why these are the most loving, adorable, sweet pups. The organization has a for-life policy on all their dogs, so you never have to worry if something goes wrong about abandoning it back into abuse or anything, and all adoptions have a 2-week trial for you to make sure it's a fit before signing anything away. They work with you very personally to ensure your dog is a good fit for YOU (your home, kids, other pets, activity levels, etc). I got Nigel through them, and he's perfect. He looks like an actual show-dog...probably sold for ~$2K when he was a puppy. When in foster care, they taught him basic commands, socialized him, and got him all of his vaccines, and neutered him. He came to me with basic commands down and potty trained, ready to go, for my fee of $185. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/pJ7J6IG.png) is proof he's as handsome as I say he is. He's also sweet, great with kids, cuddly, and hates getting up early. Literal perfection. Please DM me if you want any more info. When I got him he was about a year and a half, and he's about 55 lbs, so just your preferences!

'Gender identity disorder', (or whatever it's called) is a **mental** disorder. It's not some biological accident where the body was mis-assigned.

We reel in horror at people who've destroyed their faces with plastic surgery, or who inject substances into their lips, butts, faces to try to look different. These are all byproducts of a mentally ill person trying to modify their body to meet some impossible physical expectations of themselves.

Yet inverting a boy's penis or sewing a meat stick onto a girl is supposed to elicit cheers of 'brave' while we all pretend not to pity the poor soul.

"I think the biggest cost driver is the right-of-way acquisition.  It's really expensive to get land.

Landowners get a big chunk of the money this thing costs.  Directly by Sound Transit buying their land.  But even more so if we put a station next to their building.

The amazing upside of this thing is that we only have to buy the land once.  Then it's public.  In the future, we can upgrade the tracks, signals, stations and trains as technology advances, but we won't have to buy all sorts of new land to do it.  

Transportation is such a huge part of most people's personal budgets.  By reducing the need to put miles on your car, you put money back into people's pocket that will immediately turn around and spend it on something else.

"EXACTLY.

A friend of mine lost his puppy in Redmond (ran away from a dog sitter). The dog was young, skittish, and loose for about 6 days. 

He brought out 2 dog crates and put in old t-shirts and clothing the family had worn, in each. Then he placed the crates about 300 yards apart, in the vicinity of where the dog had last been seen. The next morning, the dog was asleep in one of the crates, with the door open. 

The dog is lost, and is looking for you.  Help the dog find you by leaving your scent where you want the dog to find you. 

If you roam the entire area, and keep going in larger and larger circles, you will cause the dog to smell you in larger and larger circles, and therefore the dog will wander in larger and larger circles looking for you. Resist marching all over tarnation to find the dog. Let the dog find you. Go out where you think the dog is, but confine your activity to where  you want the dog to go. 

If you can enlist other people the dog does not know, to march around and look, that would be better.

The Community Policing means that they try to redirect and not arrest people who might be having a mental health issue. That's the directions that they're given. They community groups have the mayor's office wrapped around their finger because it's either their job to lobby or they don't have a job so its easy to get large groups at city hall.

"Yes, they're underpaid. Nurses, *especially* pediatric nurses, are responsible for people's lives. They are on their feet, constantly pushing, pulling, rolling, turning and moving heavy equipment to get the job done. They are some-what frequently (at least compared to the rest of the world's population) in blood and/or shit up to their (double-gloved) wrists, encased in plastic gowns, breathing through a plastic mask (so the shit doesn't splash them in the face), sweating buckets, as they clean up patients who are in bad shape. Always moving at the speed of light, trying to get ahead, stay ahead, anticpate the next order from the doctor, get the med out, measure it, verify it, ensure the patient has the right kind of access to their body for it, verify the right patient, the right route, the right dose, the right time - EVERY time they give EACH medication to EVERY patient. 

So yeah, staffing matters. If your staffing is supposed to be 3-4 patients to one nurse in a 30 bed facility, and two nurses call out sick, and nobody to fill in, you're fucked. 

Nurses, by LAW, cannot leave their assignment (aka patients) until they give report to another nurse. They have to ensure patients are safe, and taken care of, it's their duty, it's their priority, it's their license on the line. 

You make ONE mistake, you fuck up ONE time, and you're thrown under a bus by management so fast it'll make your head spin.  You remember oh, I wanna say 10 years ago, a nurse at Children's accidentally gave a patient the wrong dose of a medication. She was working too fast, didn't notice. The kid died.

The nurse, who had worked there for over 20 years, was summarily fired and had a lot of sanctions imposed upon her. She couldn't find another job due to having to be supervised for a certain amount of time. She killed herself. 

So yeah, nurses care about staffing, they want to keep patients safe, they want to work.

"Nowhere. One time I got a ticket for parking beside a fire hydrant. I was parked for like 10 minutes. Now... when I got back to my car and saw the ticket, I was like... wtf... I don't see a hydrant anywhere. So I start looking around. There was a hydrant. With one of those trident like [signs](http://sequoiasigns.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/sidewalk-sign-2.jpg) placed over it (it was a real-estate sign). The hydrant was completely covered. There was no way to see it. 

So... The ticketing officer, obviously understood what had happened. He didn't even move the fucking sign off of the hydrant. And furthermore, he must have just been camping that spot out, because I wasn't parked long at all. I took pictures and documented it. 

In order to fight this ticket, I would have to take a day off work, drive into the heart of toronto (I lived in oakville at the time) pay for parking, wait in line at the traffic thingy, DECLARE that I wanted to fight the ticket, wait 3 months, take another day off work, drive into toronto, pay for parking, and wait all day at the court house. I think it was a 150$ fine.

I paid the fine. Obviously it wouldn't be worth it to fight it. I'd end up spending more in time/effort/gas/parking/time off work, than its worth. So basically an employee of toronto parking unit is just scamming the shit out of all these people to make his quotas. I wouldn't be surprised if he put the fucking sign there. Absolutely no real recourse.

By banning any user who posts a subreddit hyperlink in any r/Seattle thread, unless it's one of the approved subs listed in the rules. 

Today he posted a sticky post basically bitching about how he's been treated unfairly and his version of certain accusations. u/careless then turned into a little baby when his post didn't go over well in the comments, so he took it down. 

Post after post has gone up today essentially mocking the mod, calling him to step down, and users encouraging others to check out the new sub. Users did their best to type out the name of the new sub without actually typing it exactly, but hinting to the subs name. This got A LOT of users unexpectedly and permanently banned.

"I know some nurses at Seattle Childrens. Every year or two the union renegotiates their contract with the hospital. There's usually a cost of living wage increase of ~3%, that's been the norm. However, apparently this year the hospital got a new CEO who is trying to play hardball, offering no cost of living increase and cutting benefits. 

The hospital is doing very well financially but they seem to be putting all their funds toward increased compensation for administration and building projects while squeezing the nurses. 

The biggest issue is the unsafe staffing, they are starting to get high turnover and not hiring enough nurses, so the nurses they have are being asked to work multiple 16-hour shifts in a row, not getting enough breaks, etc. This is a big safety issue when you've somone who is sleep-deprived and overworked administering kids' medications.

"Why are you entitled to free public roads to move around? Or free sidewalks to get where you're going?  Or a free fire department to stop your personal property from burning to the ground? Oh right, taxes are used to pay for community resources. 

People are upset because a few years ago their taxes were enough to adequately cover the community resource of parking. With the influx of people that has put more strain on that particular resource. Also, with more people it doesn't make sense to try and scale that particular resource: it would be too burdensome space-wise and financially. But that doesn't mean people don't have the right to be upset that one of their community resources, that they likely paid taxes toward, is now diminishing in usefulness. They're paying the same/similar taxes but are being forced to use it less. It's not surprising that people feel unhappy about that. 

The unfortunate part is that due to Seattle's growth, the benefits of having a smaller city are being eroded away.

"NO!

For fucks sake, no.

The felony must be of a violent nature and there must be an IMMINENT threat to your life.

Imminent means right fucking now. Not 10 hours later when you use those drugs.

You need to consult the Jury instructions in WPIC Chapter 16.03

&gt;Although the statute does not limit the kind of attempted felony that will justify a homicide, the deadly force appears to be limited to resisting felonies committed by violence such as those when great personal injury is involved or in which human life is threatened. In State v. Nyland, 47 Wn.2d 240, 287 P.2d 345 (1955), the court held that adultery is not a crime that imperils the life of the unoffending spouse or threatens personal injury and in no event may the life of a human being be taken to prevent the commission of an act of adultery. See also State v. Griffith, 91 Wn.2d 572, 589 P.2d 799 (1979) (unlawful trespass does not come within felonious activity envisioned by the statute).

My natural reaction would've probably been feeling weird and vulnerable, laughing away the uncomfortableness of it, and remaining silent. Women have been the butt of inappropriate jokes in office places for a long ass time, she did her best to make the perpetuator be the one feeling uncomfortable. The people that continue mildly sexist and racist attitudes deserve a stronger reaction than feels comfortable and natural to give. I commend her for that.

"I've been working in higher education for 12 years and I'm scratching my head trying to remember the last time (ever?) I've seen this. 

A university publicly admonishing and correcting a professor's statements is exceedingly rare. When I worked at Western we had a loudmouth Climate Change denier and even he wasn't corrected like this, because of academic freedom. 

This is clearly an attempt by Wazzu to shut up a researcher who angered powerful political interests (and potential donors) in Eastern Washington. 

I know a professor who used to teach at Wazzu and studied water rights, when he started there he was told ""don't do any of your research on in-state issues. You piss of the wrong people your career is over. Do your research in California."" 

Funny I do pretty much exactly the opposite now. I work in California and most of my research is on Washington and BC. But I'm not a full on academic, I'm one of those 'neither fish nor fowl' people who works at a university. 

Still, 12 years in this business I'm trying to remember the last time I saw this, and I can't honestly remember.

"&gt; How can you explain a 150% increase in encampments in two years when the population is only growing around 2% per year?

I'm a longtime local with a good resume, a grad degree, no substance abuse problems, two kids, and an ex-wife. I lost my last high-paying gig three years ago and haven't been able to find pay-comparable work since. Since then I've temporarily lost my kids and have had to bounce from rented room to couch to car seat because I can't afford both rent and paying off the mountain of debt I incurred trying to keep a roof over my kids' heads for two years without work.

So I'm technically what you'd call homeless, /u/antibutter. I don't steal bikes, chase people around with knives, lurk in brambles, shoot junk, piss in doorways, or set fires under the highway. I just had the bad luck to run out of savings/credit right about the time rents in Seattle started rising with visions of young urban tech professionals in the head of every money-hungry landlord. I'm the explanation to your question, or at least part of it.

It used to be possible to cobble together a fairly comfortable life in Seattle with useful but odd jobs and a low-key gig or consultancy. We rented from mom &amp; pop landlords who knew our names (instead of the blase ApartmentCo representative who only knows your name from your rent check). Our neighbors were mechanics, school teachers, retired folk, craftspeople, coffee shop workers, musicians...all people a city can't function without: whose lives enriched everyone else's in our provincial little Seattle way. These people still live here...well, in the area anyway. Now you'll find them commuting from White Center or Lake City to jobs in town 'cause their amazing old apartment (and believe me every old timer has a story about at least one in their lives up here) got knocked over for one of those fungal 'tall/skinny' townhome developments or Ma &amp; Pa Landlord sold out to ApartmentCo and the rents doubled. So now Joe Espresso-Slinger goes from a $600 1BR on Capitol Hill and a $90/mo. bus pass to a $900 1BR in Lake City, plus the cost of car/ins/gas he never had to cope with before; utterly in exile from his social life.

"Yes, black people ARE fatally shot by police at a higher rate than white people. (See, for example: https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/study-finds-police-fatally-shoot-unarmed-black-men-at-disproportionate-rates/2016/04/06/e494563e-fa74-11e5-80e4-c381214de1a3_story.html?tid=a_inl or Google as liberally as you like!)

Some recent research, linked below, has suggested that these differences--at least in Houston--can be accounted for by police encountering black people in dangerous situations at higher rates than white people. In other words, given that a scenario between a police officer and civilian has already been elevated to a dangerous level, white and black civilians are shot at similar rates. That's not the same thing as what you said, though. 

But this can't be too surprising. Disproportionality occurs all along the criminal justice process. It is a diffuse thing. Black people are more likely to be stopped by police, to be charged with a crime, to be perceived as dangerous, to be treated with force, and so on. These are all within the universe of issues of concern to Kapernick, BLM, etc. 

Unless you believe that black people are inherently *inclined* to commit more crime and be more violent and more dangerous, this disporportionality--wherever it occurs--signals that our system is in need of reform.

"Hmm it looks like it might be GPS now: http://199.191.49.179/p/FrequentlyAskedQuestions.action


It used to be like below:


King County Metro
OneBusAway is just a front end to data from MyBus http://mybus.org/, which provides the underlying tracking data. MyBus was developed in the days before cheap GPS units, so it actually works by putting a wheel rotation encoder on each bus that tracks the active mileage of each bus. This info gets radioed in once a minute and is translated into an estimated position along each route. Since this method isn't super accurate, there are radio transponders located in a few places along each route that provide a sync signal for positioning.

MyBus takes this estimated position data and produces a deviation from schedule for a number of timepoints along each route (distinct from the actual stops along each route). That data can be publicly accessed through the web interfaces at http://mybus.org/ or through some web services provided by the Intelligent Transportation Systems group at UW (the original developers of the MyBus tracking system: see http://www.its.washington.edu/its_ws.html).

OneBusAway combines the timepoint prediction data from MyBus with the transit database from MetroKC to interpolate prediction data to each physical stop along a route. The transit database from Metro is sort of public, but you have to fill out a waiver to get access.

"One thing to keep in mind about Canada and Chinese investors is that Canada, particularly Vancouver, has long been a place for Asian investor expats (Hong Kong since the late 80s, mainland China now). Many Chinese ""abused"" this investor visa program to get residency in Canada by ""investing"" money and receiving permanent residence in return. The US has a similar program, but it requires actually running a business and creating jobs so it's inherently less attractive than Canada. Canada has since ended this program but at this point there is already a sizable RE economy that feeds on itself and the virtuous cycle continued until the foreign buyer tax was passed. 

Seattle is inherently much less attractive to Chinese - you really need to speak English to live here - public transit is inadequate. It doesn't have nearly the ""comforts of home"" that Vancouver has. It's harder to get a visa here. There aren't that many Chinese people here (particularly mainland Chinese) and a lot of the Chinese that moved here are to work in tech companies so they are a much different demographic than the rich kids that flooded Vancouver and LA. 

In general I think it's much more likely the Vancouver investor segment goes to LA or SF instead of Seattle. The article only references inquiries, and the high percentage increase is probably the result of a very low base. Doesn't mean the Chinese investors won't take over Seattle, but I think it's pretty unlikely to change the market significantly. Tech jobs are the main driver here, and there doesn't really seem to be any hard evidence foreign investors have been a price driver outside of the 2-3M+ segment in the east side.

"Reading the comments of the Seattle Times readers causes me great frustration. So many clueless residents call any increase in density a strain on our city and talk about halting growth. These morons don't understand that population growth is completely inevitable and rather than have sprawled out residential development further and further away from our job centers, the most prudent thing to do is to increase housing density in the center-most neighborhoods where we can make the most out of infrastructure improvements. Being a member of the human race requires personal interests (NIMBY interests) to give way to big picture social interests. We should not allow a handful of misanthropic old homeowners get in the way of city-wide improvements and long-term city planning. Old Man Jenkins who has been a homeowner since the 50's should not decide how we zone neighborhoods.",,,,SloppyinSeattle,,,1475173385,t5_2qhad,t3_5537cz,t3_5537cz,12,1476187303,0,0,d87820g,Seattle,12,,

"I think we should start with simple things, because, it seems to me, people here don't know how to drive. Let's start with promoting WA driver's guide, especially some basic rules -  
1. (Attention, Uber drivers!) Do not stop in travel lanes for any reason (confusion, 
breakdown, letting out a passenger).  
2. On a road with two or more lanes traveling in the same 
direction, stay in the right lane except to pass.  
3. Turn from the lane that is closest to the direction you want 
to go and turn into the lane CLOSEST to the one you came from.  
4. Pedestrians and bicyclists have the right-of-way at 
crosswalks and intersections, whether the crosswalk is 
MARKED OR NOT.  
5. (This one is my favorite) At an intersection where there is no stop sign, yield sign, 
or traffic signal, drivers must yield to vehicles in the 
intersection and to those COMING FROM THE RIGHT.  
6. Don't talk, text or read Facebook while driving (I noticed that most of the drivers in Seattle do the opposite)

etc.

Like he said, (some) Black folk were beating white folk.  A black officer shot a black man for mortally dangerous violent behavior.  I do not think it racist or unfair to characterize such violent behavior as ""thuggish.""

I think the answer to the Black Lives Matter movement is the demilitarization of our police.  But acts of violence against white people motivated by these shootings are hate crimes and should not receive this blanket of protection from critique.

As for the parking enforcement division, they were likely called out by the construction company to ""deal with the people who disobeyed the no parking signs"" and dealt with them, unaware that the signs had been posted moments before making the call to parking enforcement.

[Dec 2011](https://www.good.is/articles/bike-czar-nicole-freedman-gets-boston-pedaling)

&gt;To find out how cities are getting people back on the bicycle, GOOD chatted with the director of bike programs for the city of Boston, Nicole Freedman. **As the unofficial ""bike czar,""** of a city that’s been on the ""least bike-friendly"" list three years running, she has her work cut out for her.

"Keith from Seattle Subway here.

Responding to a few questions in the thread.

We used the discounted individual online cost for The Seattle Times as being the lowest and therefore the most fair number.  Regular priced print edition works out to $452/Year and average taxpayers per household is about 2 -- which is obviously more.  

http://www.seattletimes.com/subscribe/offers/

Sound Transit has always included operating costs in their measures.  One thing they definitely got right looking at how DC is now suffering after years of deferred maintenance.  

For more information on how the tax per person is calculated below.   It seems from some comments we've seen that a lot of people assume the average taxpayer lives alone in a $600k house and drives a $35k car.  That is not the case.  

In The Sound Transit taxing district, the average household earns about $73k, has two people, and lives in a dwelling that is taxed at a $360k value and a car that is taxed as having a $5k value.

"Sure. My personal viewpoint of this, /u/careless, while that big stickied post was nice and all, you are blending the realm of personal life vs volunteer as a mod. Even with that whole post, everything is about you. ""I did not do this, I got Doxxed, I didn't hit on her!"" Not about the sub. You. 

No one cares. No one cares about you or your personal life as long as you keep your personal business away from your moderation, which you obviously failed to do. Stop acting so paranoid about everything. 

And for the love of God, locking your own explanation post? What a stellar idea that was! You should have known that there where going to be people in there just there to hate on you. It got a little out of control and you locked it? You could have just kept it up and rolled with it. This is a prime example of over moderation and poor decision making on your part, or at the very least an inability to take a punch over the internet of all things. To wrap it all up, this whole condescending attitude you have needs to be adjusted if you have any hope that this will blow over. All of these qualities do not make a good moderator. 

I know it's a volunteered position and you probably feel like you worked really hard to keep this sub going being the most active mod, but I think you should step down. That is the most adult thing to do. The more you fight, the more of your true colors you appear to reveal and the more people detest you.

"The council's proposal ""says the city has to provide an alternate site or housing before sweeps and provide 30-day notice."" 

I don't see what is unreasonable about this requirement. Unauthorized encampments are not pleasant or safe, but simply displacing these people without warning, preparation, or an alternate site is unproductive or counterproductive at best. 

Murray is discussing a ""Rapid Rehousing"" solution, but from what I can find [current Rapid Reshousing](https://www.ywcaworks.org/page.aspx?pid=1359) only applies to families and is not comprehensive. 

In other words, from what I can find in this article and elsewhere, Murray doesn't appear to have any viable alternative plan as opposed to the council's proposed bill.

So is he basically saying that this is just for bargaining, and he doesn't actually think the building should be historic?  I really don't like the idea of designating what probably shouldn't be a historic building as historic just to save a beloved business.  I love that ReBar exists, and I hope it continues to exist.  But we shouldn't allow an abuse of the historic designation just to keep a business we all like.  What happens when ReBar inevitably closes in the future and now we're left with what really shouldn't have been a historic building, making terrible use of what should be a high density lot, and also no ReBar?

If a business is really great and should be kept around for the community (which ReBar probably matches this criteria), we need to find legitimate ways of funding those, or some sort of city program for helping them find and afford space.

The internet is a  strange place, and for a lot of people it's new. Their first internet connection was their iPhone, so things like trolls and lying are new and confusing to them. Im just surprised at the reaction of this boards mod. It's like they have no prior experience in interneting or modding online communities. Hell, there are users that know this guys real identity and he identifies with the company he represents as well? I would never never do something so STUPID on the internet. Reddit needs mod HR to screen these people who think they can handle an internet community because they can program or sell houses or whatever. It takes a very special kind of person to do this job, and the /r/seattle mod is way too in the real world to handle internet people correctly.",,,,TelmatosaurusRrifle,,,1475084705,t5_2qhad,t3_54vzmc,t3_54vzmc,22,1476151372,0,0,d85rwk1,Seattle,22,,

"You don't say where you're starting, so I'm going to assume you can start by the Space Needle.

**PART 1 - Great views, mostly flat and separated from traffic**

* From there I'd go east on Mercer which has a nice newish separated bike track to Westlake, stopping in Lake Union park to look out over Lake Union with all its wooden boats and seaplanes.

* Then head north on the new Westlake bike track crossing over the Fremont Bridge, which you should note raises more often than any other bridge in North America.

* Take a left on 34th and bike on the new two-way bike track there, past the PCC until you hit Theo's chocolate factory on your right, and two giant dinosaurs on your left.  There's also two bike shops within a one block radius of this spot in case you need any assistance.

* Then get on the Burke Gilman trail and head east back the way you came along the Fremont Canal, under the Fremont bridge, and stopping under the Aurora Bridge for some more epic views.

* Continue east along the BG and pull into Gas Works Park for more cool things to look at and a big grassy hill to take a break on if you want.  Then get back on the BG and stay on it, making a slight detour up onto the mall in front of UW for great views of the University and Rainier if the weather is nice.

* Get back on the BG heading north, and it'll be all downhill here until you get to 25th, which will be the next set of lights.  Here I would backtrack slightly and head NW up Ravenna, following it up a twisty climb as it changes into NE Ravenna Blvd, and then take that separated bike lane all the way to NW to Green Lake.

* Take a left on Greenlake Way which has bike lanes, heading SW around the lake, and then bomb down Stone Way back to 34th.

* Take a left on 34th and climb back to the Fremont Bridge, and take a left on Fremont Ave across the bridge.

* Here you can either continue straight up and over Dexter, which will take you back to Seattle Center, or you can do some riding on the road and some more climbing for some more sweet views.

-

**PART 2 - About 50% road and quite a bit of climbing, but totally worth it**

* If you want to keep going, take a right after you cross the bridge and ride west along the South Ship Canal Trail as it turns into Emerson, and then cross at the lights onto 21st Ave W.  Take this for a while as it turns into W Commodore Way, stopping at Commodore Park to gaze across the canal at the Ballard Locks.

* Then get back on Commodore Park until you dead end, and take a left on 40th for a steep climb up to Texas Way.  Take a right there and bike into Discovery Park, following the paved trails around until you exit at Magnolia Blvd.

* Once you're there you can bomb down Magnolia for some truly epic views of the sound.

* Eventually you'll take a left on Thorndyke heading north, and continue downhill until you'll take a sharp 90 degree right to head south on 20th Ave W.

* 20th will take you south to the Elliott Bay Trail, which you can then ride along the water through Centennial Park, and all the way to the Olympic Sculpture Garden.

* From there take a left, climb back up Broad St, and once you get to 5th you're back at Seattle Center.

"* **Distracted driving**, mostly cell phones. You can see their face lit up by the glow when they're hiding it in their lap -- they know they're breaking the law, they just know they can get away with it.

* **Aggressive driving**, sudden lane changes without signaling, passing on freeway shoulders.

* **Headlight law should be updated**, currently allows driving without headlights half an hour beyond sunset and half an hour before sunrise, and few people can accurately judge the thousand-foot-visibility requirement for bad weather.  Should be required any time between sunset and sunrise, and should add a requirement for lights any time it's raining enough to turn on wipers.

* **Failure to stop for occupied crosswalks** -- Crosswalk enforcement cameras work well in other places, they'd work great here, especially for school zones and busier locations with crosswalks that aren't signal-protected.

* **Exiting/turning right from other than the right lane** -- 99 with the bus lane on the right, for example, some drivers think they're not supposed to merge into the bus lane before making a right turn, or that they're supposed to turn onto the highway across the bus lane instead of into the bus lane.

* **Changing lanes in intersections**, like taking a left turn into the right lane of a 2-lane street.  Lots of drivers have moved here from states that allow lane changes in intersections, and there's no testing required on Washington laws when they get their license here.

* A growing issue -- **insanely bright strobing headlights on bicycles** -- for $50 Amazon will sell you a flashing LED headlight that's brighter than both high beams on a car.  ""At least they can see me....""  Yeah, but I can't tell exactly where you are, and I can't tell where you're going, and I can't see the street in front of me over the glare.  They're clearly illegal, any flashing headlight on a bike is illegal, but they keep getting brighter and more common.  (At least I don't have strobe-induced migraines, vertigo, or seizures.)  

* Not a driver behavior, but a significant concern on many freeways -- **""ghost"" striping on freeway projects**.  WSDOT appears to allow old lines to be ground off in just the area of the line, leaving a groove that fills with rain and is just as reflective as a painted stripe.  Several other states mandate over-grinding to eradicate the **shape** of old markings as well as the actual paint or plastic.  Lines get feathered out a couple of feet wide, turn arrows get a big rectangle so there's no trace of the old arrow, etc.

Planned Parenthood is not just for poor people. They exist to serve women in their health care needs without any religious or biases in their care. If a surgeon exists who will help this person with their needs, and it's the proper medical thing to do, they'll help. 

It's also a great resource for teenagers who don't know where to go or what to do. Teenagers rely on their closest adults to provide them with correct health care and birth control information, and that isn't always reliable. Planned Parenthood can be that unbiased medical resource for these kids.

"RapidRide is supposed to be BRT, its just a half assed implementation of it.

Planks of BRT are:

1: Dedicated ROW (a dedicated lane for the bus)

2: Signal priority (bus has a switch that makes all lights for it green.  Tho this is moot for ST3 as it looks like most of the BRT is freeway buses)

3: Longer than normal stop spacing (speeds up getting through an area)

4: Off bus payment (kinda like Link, buy your ticket or swipe your Orca card at the station, then just step on the bus.  Speeds up boarding)

5: Upgraded dedicated stations (more standing area, canopies, ticket machines, Curb bulbs, etc)

6: Upgraded buses (Longer articulated buses with nicer seating inside)

RapidRide hits on 4, 5 and 6 pretty well. Lines like the E line have their own lane in some areas, but those lanes are shared by all Metro buses and don't run the whole length of the route.  None that I know of have signal priority, but happy to be corrected if that's not the case.  E line also seems to have pretty much identical stop spacing to the old 358 bus it replaced.  Those things add up to make it not so rapid.

A lot of work needs to go into the freeway BRT lines.  Freeway center stops like in MTLK Terrace are really nice for keeping things moving.  I hope to see more of them at various PNRs.

"[You forgot one](http://www.cnn.com/2013/05/27/travel/china-egypt/)

But in all seriousness, be careful of judging all Chinese based on obnoxious 'Chinese tourists'. Keep in mind 40 some years ago, China was basically closed off to the outside world.  Only recently has the middle class had the means to travel domestically, let alone internationally. There are MANY Chinese who have 'New Money' (tuhao). Maybe their father bought a coal mine or is lining his pockets with bribes. They do act like rules don't apply to them, drive fancy cars and cut in line, because back home, that's perfectly acceptable. [Take this kid for example, trying to bribe police in Des Moines after running a stop sign and killing a woman](http://komonews.com/news/local/wealthy-chinese-student-convicted-of-deadly-crash-is-deported-11-21-2015). 

My point is, this is more a product of globalization than it is Chinese culture. Many of these people from the country side are riding a plane for the first time, traveling abroad for the first time, and their parents (58 and older) very likely weren't college educated. They may seem clueless when you see them traveling because maybe they are. Remember behavior is learned, and their parents probably never visited museums or navigated airport.

"&gt; Does Seattle have a Crow problem

No. We have the awesomeness of our local natural mascot. *Corvus brachyrhynchos* rules our skies as our squawky, bitchy kings and queens.

&gt; Do they have a natrual predator in the Pacific Northwest?

I've seen owls, hawks, and bald eagles try to take them now and then, but it seems to be too much of a pain in the ass. They attack one and suddenly here are a hundred more crows driving them away. 

&gt; Can my nephew shoot them with my pellet gun?

No. It's very illegal.

&gt; Ornithologists at the Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture have the answer in our 12th installment of Ask the Burke

&gt; Answer: The crow population has increased dramatically in Seattle over the past 40 years. Increases in human population have reduced forest cover, creating open foraging areas preferred by crows and generated food sources such as garbage that crows are quick to exploit.

"&gt; Those countries basically have similar policies that what I have described above, with some variation of course. I do realize its technically possible to obtain weapons as an average citizen in those countries, but even then, the restrictions on them are so overwhelming its not that far from an outright ban

That is objectively wrong. In Canada, this [Tavor 21](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/IWI-Tavor-TAR-21w1.jpg) is categorized as an unrestricted firearm, making it just as easy to buy as this [Remington 700](https://www.remington.com/sites/default/files/styles/product_gallery_1200/public/product/rifle/galleryimages/Model700CDL_SF_84028_Beauty-3.jpg?itok=AOwVVQ1l). You can buy it without a background check, without registration, and without a waiting period. The laws governing semi-automatic rifles in most of the other countries listed are typically no different than acquiring any other type of sporting firearms.

In Switzerland, the [SIG 550](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b7/Stgw_90.jpg) is the most popular gun in the country. Similarly, in Finland some of the most popular guns are civilian variants of the [Valmet 76](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6a/RK_62_76.jpg), which is in turn a derivative of the AKM.

&gt; For example, in Norway you can't have a gun in a public place unless there was a clear indication of it being for an appropriate use ( driving to the woods with a rifle in your trunk in an approved, locked case is fine. Walking with a rifle or handgun down the street is definitely not allowed).

This is completely orthogonal to banning all modern firearms. You're comparing apples to oranges here - if you want to defend a ban on all modern firearms, why are you all of a sudden writing about carry laws?

&gt; In Canada, for example, its illegal to have a semi-automatic weapon that is capable of shooting more than 5 shots at a time. 

Again, you're pivoting to a point different from your original proposal to ban all semi-automatic firearms.

Also, the limit is 10 rounds, not 5 rounds. Ostensibly rifles are limited to 5 rounds and pistols 10 rounds, but there's no law against inserting a 10 round pistol magazine into a rifle. Second, this limit really only exists on paper. The RCMP has confirmed that it's perfectly legal to take a 10 round magazine chambered in a larger cartridge and insert a greater number of smaller cartridges. You can buy a [10 round .50 Beowulf magazine](http://www.shopalexanderarms.com/Magazines-10-Round_50_Beowulf_Magazine_1.html) and stick 30 rounds of 5.56x45mm and be perfectly legal (the "".50 Beowulf® magazines will feed only .50 Beowulf® ammunition."" disclaimer isn't actually true).

And for what it's worth, France, Germany, Sweden, Finland, and Switzerland all do not have magazine capacity restrictions (and maybe other as well, these are just the countries that I know for sure do not have magazine restrictions).",,,,Guinea_Pig_Handler,,,1473648376,t5_2qhad,t3_52beqn,t1_d7j2qgf,13,1475575704,0,0,d7j3422,Seattle,13,,

"&gt; Camping on sidewalks, rights of way, school grounds and highway overpasses would be prohibited under the ordinance sponsored by Councilmembers Rob Johnson, Lisa Herbold, Mike O’Brien and Kshama Sawant, they said. The ordinance doesn’t explicitly name all of those areas, though, nor does it address camping in parks in detail. It says the Department of Neighborhoods would decide which locations would be off-limits.

No, they are allowing camping anywhere except sidewalks, rights of way, schools and overpasses. Everywhere else is open season as the legislation passes the buck to DoN.

"Lots of thoughts on this...

I watched about 15 high school students walk right out into an intersection after getting off the city bus yesterday, and I don't mean the crosswalks.  They walked right out into the middle of the intersection.  I sat at a green light for 15 seconds before I could move, and if they had been at the intersection a few seconds earlier, I would not have been able to stop.  This is where this city is heading.  We have to dumb down everything to protect the lowest common denominators in this city.  I mean you, I, and everyone else understand not to walk diagonally though an intersection at 8am in Seattle, but since we have made it a priority to keep everyone safe they all feel like it is OK to just walk out into the street. 

We design a road in 1960 for cars to go 60 on, then we lower that to 50, because there is a gas crisis, then its 45 due to congestion, then its 40 help port traffic merge, then its 30 to because of the children and all of a sudden why does is take me 3 times longer to get where I need to go?  Why are drivers all over the place at different speeds, it feels like a race?  Duh. Yes increased amounts of drivers are on the roads, but slowing down the flow of traffic by 25-40% doesn't help anything but to bunch up the traffic even tighter.

I live a block off Rainier in CC and we went through the road diet because maniacs are driving too fast through the business district.  Yes, I agree, there were the occasional assholes driving 50mph through there, but there was nothing wrong with the 30-35 speed limit.  And it wasn't the speeders that were crashing into buildings, it was the inattentive divers, not expecting for an Uber driver to have double parked in the right lane of Rainier.  Every, and I mean every accident I saw in the CC business district was caused by someone stopped in the right of way, then 5 cars back someone gets into an accident, not expecting traffic to come to a sudden stop because somebody couldn't drive the extra 50 feet to make a right turn into one of the loading zones off of Rainier.  Now from Genesee to Orcas its just one slow moving mass going 15mph.  The city beat me on that one, I don't drive Rainier unless I absolutely have to. My record for making a left hand turn on to Rainier since the diet is over 4 minutes, to drive from Orcas to Genesee, 14 minutes.  That is insane.  You can walk there that fast.

We keep making things safer when we should be making things harder.  I just read about a driving school that had their students taking pics of the written tests at the DOL so they could feed the answers to others that don't speak English.  2 weeks ago I had Samir, my Uber driver for a night of boozing, stop at every intersection whether there was a stop sign or not.  It was obvious that this person had no idea what the laws were on the roadway, had n  Its insane that we have people who cannot speak the language, who cannot read the signs, who have not studied the rules, driving commercial vehicles all over this city.

If we really wanted to improve the safety of driving in this city for card, bikes, and peds, here are my proposals:

1.  Minimum 5 years of driving in the USA, with insurance records to prove that you were driving, before being allowed to operate as a for hire or commercial driver.  There should be a Seattle version of ""The Knowledge"" before you are allowed to drive on these streets for a living.  You can spot the shitty Uber drivers here from a mile away.  They have made driving way worse.

2.  Make the driving test way tougher.  Double the amount of written questions.  Double the amount of real world driving tests.  Make every driver re-qualify every 3 years, no exceptions.  If you drive commercial, tested every year.  Make the fees for testing a sliding scale, first test $100, second test $200, third test $300.  I saw a lady crying once at the DMV a few years ago, asked daughter why the lady was crying (she didn't speak english) and she said this was the 8th time she had failed the driving test.  Some people are just not meant to drive.  Maybe we can motivate those people into public transportation instead of dumbing down the entire system to their skill level.  You must remain skilled at driving to continue driving.

3.  Every vehicle over 10 years old goes through a safety check.  Brakes, lights, glass, engine, etc. We do it for emissions, we should do it for the rest of the car as well.  Too many crap cars are on the roadway, and the worst ones are the Port drayage trucks.  I was a heavy wheel mechanic in the Army and those trucks scare the crap out of me.  Walk along the roads in the areas they operate, and look for all the bolts and parts in the gutters.  Those come from trucks that are literally falling apart as they pull 20 ton containers around town.  

4. stop offering blanket solutions to local problems.  The Rainier road diet was a good local solution, to a point.  Lowering the speed limit to 25 was dumb.  30 or even 35 would keep the traffic moving, and with only one lane there now there is a lowered chance of people driving into buildings all the time.  Slower doesn't always mean better.

5.  Legislation to prevent stupidity is a death cycle.  You are never, ever, ever, going to stop people from getting run over, it just happens.  The only solution is to remove all vehicles.  People got trampled in the streets by horses 150 years ago.  I remember someone pointing out when vision zero was announced that more than half of the peds killed in Seattle the year before literally walked out into traffic wearing headphones.  There are more people killed on the damn railroad tracks than on the city streets, and its a friggin railroad!  Trains can't even turn and idiots get killed on the tracks all the time!

I can't decide if I need to write an initiative, or sell my house and move away, or just buy an electric bike and give up. Murray is a tool, Kulby is an idiot, and we all wonder why traffic and quality of life keep getting worse.  Maybe it would be better if stopped lowering the expectations of interacting in public.

"I do not mean this to be rude, but please, please take some serious time looking into how to raise a well-rounded, well-behaved puppy. Look into how much money it can (and will) cost. Look into how much training it takes. Look into how much exercise each breed needs. Think, very, very strongly about just how much time you want to invest into a puppy. You say you're new here. You're probably going to want to get out and explore the city and surrounding area and despite it being somewhat dog-friendly around here, there are a LOT of places you can't take a dog. So you might be away from home a lot more than you think you will right now. You can't leave puppies alone by themselves very long. They need to go out repeatedly. They need mental stimulation. They need lots of exercise. What are you going to do with it when you want to go away for a weekend? Can you afford $30+/night to board them? What are you going to do when you work late and can't get home to let them out? What are you going to do when your coworkers want to get drinks after work but your dog is at home? What happens when you move? Are you prepared to pay hundreds of dollars in pet deposits and fees, once you even find a place that accepts your dog? (Note that many, many landlords/apartments have breed and/or size restrictions.)

Puppies (and later, dogs) are incredible, wonderful companions but you have to raise them to be that way. Every dog requires training, time, effort, energy, money, and sacrifices in other areas of your life. I say all this because I've been involved with rescue, and I see what happens when people just don't think about these things ahead of time. Cute little puppies grow up to be rambunctious, ill-trained dogs and suddenly the owners don't want them. Rescues then have to step in and fill in the training holes that are left to get them adoptable. Please do your homework and seriously think about the impact a dog will have on your life and if you're ready for that responsibility at this point in your life. 

With all that said, adoptapet.com and petfinder.com are great resources where rescues post their adoptable animals. You can filter by location, age, breed, size, etc and see what is available.",,,,rubberduck05,,,1474406625,t5_2qhad,t3_53lx89,t3_53lx89,12,1475885651,0,0,d7v5uk7,Seattle,12,,

"I'm 49 and an exec in the tech industry and got some really good advice when I was younger - figure out what your personal base income is.  Personal basic income is the base level of income you think you could earn without landing a job like your last one.  For me, I spent 8.5 years of my career working in strategy consulting firms, so when I left MegaSquishy Software and took two years off, I did consulting.  So, I figured out what I could reliably sell my time for to my clients and that was my 'personal basic income'.  When I was hired two years later by a client to lead a function for them as an exec, I kept most of my expenses at what I could afford under my 'go make money yourself, not from a job' level of income.

"So first, good on you for being introspective and curious and (maybe) willing to change. That's not easy.  

Start with what your goals are. If you just want to vent into the void of the internet, then keep doing what you are. You'll anger people who don't agree with you, and feel a little better, for a short while. But nothing will get any better. In fact you'll probably just make people who disagree with you do so even more.  

If you want things to get better (regarding equality and treatment of people of other races, let's say) then you have to actually do the hard thing of first being empathetic towards other people and consider their views even if they're offensive to you. Until you ""walk a mile in their shoes"", even if they're racist shoes, you won't be able to understand them, and if you don't understand them you won't be able to change their mind.   

It's uncomfortable and challenging, but that's kind of the point. In order to change someone else's view, you have to also be willing to change yours. So you have to know your facts and arguments cold, and not get into personal attacks or judgements, and also remain open and listen.  

No one likes to be yelled at and told they're stupid/ignorant/racist/mean/immoral/bad. It's the easiest way to shut down a conversation and make someone an enemy for life and have them reaffirm their current views tenfold regardless of merit. Listening, especially to things you disagree with, is the most important thing you can do. Showing you hear and understand someone doesn't imply you agree with them, but it will make them much more receptive to hearing and listening to what you have to say. If you're arguining from a morally and logically superior place, that shouldn't be a concern for you as you're in the right.

TL;DR Don't write what you feel. Consider how people who disagree with you will read it. Be an expert and knowledgable, with statistics and data as well as logical arguments, about the subject you're engaging in. 

edit/PS: A lot of things about USA are super frustrating. But the best way to appreciate it is to Travel somewhere else(or read if you're on a tight budget). And I'm not talking about Canada or UK. I mean Central/South America, Asia, Africa, or someplace.

"I agree, Portland's structure makes a lot more sense. Pronto's pricing structure makes it very difficult for me to try out their system... I don't want to commit to $8 and a whole day of riding bikes around in short intervals, and I am not going to commit foolheartedly to their annual program without trying it out. When I first try it out I want to do a single trip on a fairly safe route, which Portland's system allows for $2.50. 

But as the other poster mentions, Portland is overall better suited for a bike system. Which is why I think they should focus on a specific customer instead of trying to make Pronto work for everyone in the city.  I think university students (UW/SPU/SCC/SU etc) would benefit the most from a true bike share program. All of the racks should be placed specifically using students from various universities/colleges as their primary customer, and densely place stops wherever students would find them convenient. I think this strategy would have a better chance at reaching profitability over what they are doing now.

"They used the median Seattle income for determining the 'rent burden' rather than the mean, so extremely wealthy people are not going to bump up the value much. The median household income for Seattle is ~$72k, and a rent burden is arbitrarily set at 30%... So if your **household** is making $72k you are considered to be living within your means rent-wise (again arbitrary) if your rent is less than $1800 a month.

For the majority of people living in Seattle, rent is still affordable, and this peer reviewed study confirms it. However, if you're an individual living alone and making ~$40k a year which is close to the median income for an individual in Seattle, you'd be considered to be living outside of your means if your rent exceeds $1200 a month. For those people, I don't think Seattle is affordable and I think it'd be difficult for any study to show affordability without breaking it down into classes. For middle and upper class, Seattle remains affordable. For lower-class, Seattle is definitely out of reach barring roommates or housing assistance.

Keep in mind this study only went over rental costs, not all housing costs. Single-family home purchases in Seattle are out of affordability for many people, including middle and even upper-middle class to some degree. But the good thing is this is talked about in Seattle just about everywhere it seems, and we're also seeing a *response*. The level of new construction is at unprecedented levels, new housing guidelines are being proposed and adopted for affordability, and there is an eagerness for progress in the air.

I really have no interest in involving myself with drama, but I'd highly recommend either loosening up what constitutes a 'Seattle Related' post and letting the voting system take care of it, or at least codifying what exactly is allowed and not allowed in the subreddit's rules.",,,,Nashtok,Lower Queen Anne,,1474849767,t5_2qhad,t3_54gb3a,t1_d81z3j9,40,1476056160,0,0,d820kwi,Seattle,40,,flair

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Washington_firebombing_incident

&gt;The University of Washington firebombing incident was an arson which took place in the early morning hours of May 21, 2001 when a firebomb was set off at Merrill Hall, a part of the University of Washington's Center for Urban Horticulture, causing an estimated $1.5 to $4.1 million in damages.

&gt;The Earth Liberation Front claimed responsibility for the fire ten days after it transpired.  Prosecutors alleged they were part of ELF cell known as ""the Family.""

&gt;The motivation for the arson was rooted in **suspicions by the ELF that Professor Bradshaw, a plant geneticist, was engaging in experiments funded by the industry to produce genetically-engineered trees.** In their statement, the ELF claimed that ""Bradshaw... continues to unleash mutant genes into the environment that is certain to cause irreversible harm to forest ecosystems... As long as universities continue to pursue this reckless 'science,' they run the risk of suffering severe losses. Our message remains clear, we are determined to stop genetic engineering.""",,,,ChefJoe98136,West Seattle,,1474406395,t5_2qhad,t3_53p3vo,t1_d7v3juj,17,1475885529,0,0,d7v5nzj,Seattle,17,,flair

"I don't know man... I've been around this subreddit for ~7 years. I even temporarily became a moderator for a few weeks to try and help out.
I've watched the shitty people do shitty things, and genuinely been on your side when that's happened. I remember when CJS was created (there was an alt named U737, targeted at me), and I remember thinking that it seemed like a childish and stupid thing to do.

But right now, I do not agree with you. There are a lot of legitimate concerns about how you interact with users on this subreddit, and I think that you're far too aggressive.
I think that over the past month, you've been way too quick to dismiss people's concerns, and that's largely what you've been seeing in the posts here these past few days. 
I do not think you're seeing serious brigading nor pitchforks related to falsehoods about your actions (and for the record, I buy your point about the AirBnB alt and I'm willing to totally take you at your word on all of that).

I think that you owe it to yourself and to the 85,000 subscribers here to take a little break from r/Seattle. Maybe you don't need to un-mod, but I think it'd be good to let some of the other moderators drive the ship for a little bit.

Let them wreck the place, if that's what you think will happen (and you might be right for all we know). 

Then, come back and just see how things are going. If it's a worse shitshow than ever, then you can go right back to your way of doing things.

But if it's going well and there's an active community? Then everybody wins.

I hope you at least give what I'm saying some serious thought. Don't let it hurt your ego to take a break. For what it's worth, those of us who are adults will have a ton of respect for you. The trolls are going to troll, regardless.

"Racism in Seattle is very subtle. Seattle is not a welcoming city in general. People are extremely segmented by income and employment, and many people have very restricted social graphs - they still live, work, and socialize with people they grew up with.

When Seattlites hire, they offen hire friends. When they sell real estate they sell to people looking to stay in the same kind of community.  When they look for partners they tend to find people who share the same backgrounds.

As a result there are strong and hard to pierce demographic sorting functions at work. You may not get a job offer because you aren't in the same social space as the hiring manager. In other words, they picked someone more like them and less like you, which is de facto racism even if it in't driven by conventional ""racist"" attitudes about race.

"&gt; Too little moderation can be just as bad as too much moderation

Yeah, absolutely agreed. In previous mod-drama threads there were proposals to end *all* moderation for a week or a month and just ""see what happens"". I view that as exceptionally naive - I have no doubt that there's a ton of outright spam that the mods delete with very good reason, and ending all moderation would be a terrible idea.

But I've also been reading the ""rising"" tab, seen an interesting thread, gone to comment on it, and by the time I wrote my comment the post had already been removed for ""rule #6"". These are posts that are getting more upvotes than downvotes, have people commenting on them, and so on. It's ludicrous to me that posts like that get removed and the excuse is a rule that says ""we're a community"". For example: https://np.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/4x2sxq/airbnb_asking_its_users_to_take_action_and_email/

And it's not just me who's had that experience - a few months back we had a series of ""was your post removed from /r/seattle?"" threads.

"&gt; So what's stopping that? Why rely only on ST?

Money.  Sound Transit has the state-granted authority to (ask voters to) levy far more dedicated-to-transit taxes than the City ever will.  But, there are still some possibilities:

&gt; My question is can the city of Seattle itself build something to help?

Seattle already has a Transportation Benefit District. That's the $80 you see on your vehicle registration and it can be increased to $100 but that's already a somewhat unpopular tax and it might morph into a very unpopular one once that 3-digit barrier is hit *and* the TBD only lasts for six years.  Seattle spends almost all of that money on buying more bus service hours for inside the city (it's one reason why virtually every core route in Seattle has gone to 5a-1a span of service and at last 15-minute frequency six days per week).

Seattle could use that money to kick in to Sound Transit to inspire faster building or more building.  Whether that would build all of Ballard-UW or the ""Metro 8"" subway...is not really up for debate, it wouldn't.  But if Seattle could find matching funds *and* Sound Transit 3 comes in ahead of budget, that's a way.

There is also the much lamented Monorail tax authority.  Most observers agree that it can't really be used to build what we call ""light rail.""  (There are ways to sneak, like building light rail powered by a third-rail instead of overhead wire, but remember that the law isn't computer code and a judge will have to rule on whether Seattle was being sneaky or just realistic.)  If Seattle voters authorized using that tax and Seattle built fill-in service in conjunction with Sound Transit, that could work but would be rather limited in scope.

**/u/somenewuser's realistic editorial corner...**

What do I think will happen?  In the short- and medium-term, I think that Move Seattle plus the TBD will mean that buses become more plentiful and they have an easier time moving throughout the city.  Digging a subway all by Seattle's lonesome is too expensive and would sap the city's taxing authority to do anything else.  But more buses, more often, with more dedicated lanes would help a lot, especially if where they went tied in with Sound Transit's light rail stops.

Oh, and why do I keep writing ""with Sound Transit?""  Because this region needs another agency doing its own thing with its own rules and own routes and own fare structure like it needs a hole in the head.  Make the system compatible with what Sound Transit--and, by and large, Metro--is doing for ease of use and swiftly moving between all of them.",,,,somenewuser,Central Area,,1473702738,t5_2qhad,t3_52fbx2,t3_52fbx2,13,1475594606,0,0,d7jtor9,Seattle,13,,flair

"An Open Apology to the Masturbaters Displaced by the Block Party  

We're sorry we displaced you this weekend. It seems like when parks are put to their intended use, it's often you who suffer the most. As a society, we're in the bad habit of sometimes wanting to enjoy the city we live in. We haven't put enough energy into making sure that each person has a place in Occidental Park where they can masturbate.    
Sometimes design is used to make aspects of the city more uncomfortable for you, like benches that are difficult to masturbate on or no public toilets (again, to masturbate on). Not only do you not have the privacy of your own place to masturbate, but places where you might sit and masturbate for a minute are terribly uncomfortable -- almost as if we wish to discourage this kind of behavior!    
Not all of us are insensitive to this. We know that you are just normal, sexually healthy people with beautiful and worthy fantasies who may just need a little help masturbating right now.  
We're here to listen. We want to know how we can help. Leave even more of your rank seed in the empty newsstand boxes around here and we'll look for it.  
Today, we start with this apology. A promise of ears that listen to your fevered grunts in the bushes, and eyes that see you punishing your ragged meat handles as we walk past with our children. We are not blind to you. We know that the city needs you, your dirty needles, your broken glass, your bottles of urine, your loose piles of greasy feces, your unpredictable and aggressive screaming, your sudden fits of violence -- and, of course, your endless, flavorful sessions of public masturbation.  
Keep your rotten cocks out as much as you can. We're in this together.

"My issue with opinion pieces like this (anti gun) are always the same:

Ignorance of firearms in general and the usage of colorful language to paint a weapon as being ""more powerful"", and therefore more deadly, when in fact the weapon in question has such a low power factor that they cannot be used for hunting, unlike other autoloading weapons which CAN. I suspect this is done to paint a narrative to an uninformed public, as well as draw attention away from the fact that these weapons are almost never used for killing (suicide weather intentional or accidental, homicide or other).

The selection and adjustment of data to fit the specific narrative, instead of presenting the data as a whole. Specifically in this article, one of the organizations cited Washington Ceasefire, to my knowledge has not produced the survey methodology used to conduct the study, from respondent selection, to the actual question asked, or any other relevant details. The two things we do know: 1) The poll had 310 respondants across two states; and 2) the survey was done on surveymonkey. [Washington Ceasefire also is selective about their choice in facts](http://washingtonceasefire.org/facts-about-gun-violence/): For example, while in 2009 there were more deaths from firearms (618) than motor vehicle traffic (538) the majority of these firearm deaths were from suicide. Removing the 466 firearm suicides and leaving ""accident"", homicide, ""undetermined"" and ""Legal Intervention"" there were only 152 Firearm deaths. Only 118 of those were actually ""Murders"" despite what Washington Ceasefire claims. It is also telling that while they do cite their source in so much as saying ""Washington state Dept. of Health"" they do not provide a link to the data, [which is available publicly](http://www.doh.wa.gov/DataandStatisticalReports/VitalStatisticsData/Death/DeathTablesbyTopic) in fact, controlling for suicides by firearm, there has never been a year in which people have been killed by guns more than they have been killed by traffic since 2006 (I had not bothered looking at previous years, which go back until 1980)

Sidebar, and as fucked up as it is for me to say this, I find it disturbing how often the media feels about pointing out that the Mukilteo shooter was spotted reading the manual on the gun he bought. To me that sounds like something that a reasonable would do: When you get something new, you read the manual. The only thing disturbing about it was that it indicates that this was a premeditated event.

Patrol officers do not have time to write and submit a search warrant, or even know how, as it is traditionally a detective responsibility. 

And even if there is a third party GPS function active, if it leads to a house, and the occupants refuse entry, that's the end of the line, a judge WILL NOT sign a warrant based on 3rd party unregulated GPS software.

"What the hell do we even do about this? There was an [AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/4qhue6/i_am_joe_bernstein_a_homeless_man_in_seattle_ama/) on here recently of a guy who's been homeless for a while. He says in it that he doesn't even really think about getting out of his situation but just living day to day. Seattle's unemployment rate is one of the lowest in the country but these people aren't really looking for jobs either. It seems like helping them is just another way of making sure that they'll stay homeless forever. I was literally at a McDonald's a few weeks back that had ""Now Hiring: Jobs start at $15/hour with benefits and opportunities to advance"" and there was a clean-looking young white girl panhandling with a sign next to the exit. I agree that even if we did give the homeless food and housing that it would just lead to a huge influx of homeless or potentially homeless people from other parts of the state and country. I've visited other countries in Central and South America and those homeless people really are fucked be/c there is literally no help for them there.

" I can tell you the city's art scene isn't nearly what it used to be, which I'll admit is a superficial and shallow observation without explanation. But it's the most immediate difference I've felt since leaving and coming back. 

On a deeper level, the feeling of having shared experiences that many decades-long residents had doesn't exist anymore. This is not inherently bad, I just experience the ""growth"" as a loss of something. And that's ok. I can't change it. And I don't mean to invalidate the existence of a transplant in my homeland.

I no longer can afford to go to school and live within city limits while holding down a job without food stamps or apple health. It becomes impossible to live in this city without any sort of government assistance, a high 5 figure salary already lined up, and/or a trust fund.

"&gt; If the drug users are committing real crimes then they should be arrested.

That's exactly what isn't happening in Seattle currently.  Drug users are being given a pass on most addiction related crime.  Example:  Catherine O'Toole noted in a community meeting in Greenwood that 95% of property crime in the North Precinct is addiction related.  She also noted that the closed case rate is 7%.  They only have resources to investigate and solve a very small percentage of property crime reports and it's mostly geared towards rings of prolific offenders (7%!!!) .  Nothing SPD or any city official has said indicates they have plan to significantly reduce property crime driven by addiction.  When you put that in context of Seattle already having a property crime rate 5 times the national average it's clear that even if addicts are committing real crimes, it's not going to be enforced.

Now they want to move injections sites in to concentrate addiction related crime even more in certain areas?  I can tell you what's going to happen:  People living in those areas are going to be robbed blind. Then they'll start locking down anything and everything.  The addicts are still going to need to steal things relatively close to where they buy and use drugs, so 1) There will be more brazen acts of theft, more home invasions.  2) There will be more muggings and robberies and 3) more people are going to get hurt or killed during the commission of these crimes (both addicts and victims).  Supply of drugs is a huge, huge concern for both the addicts and the population as a whole and safe injection does NOTHING to change the supply dynamic other than concentrate it in certain areas.

They need to prescribe heroin to cut out the theft.  Until that happens this is going to be a huge problem for everyone around the sites.  ",,,,JohnDanielsWhiskey,,,1473990402,t5_2qhad,t3_52yope,t1_d7oo1b1,11,1475721648,0,0,d7ooj78,Seattle,11,,

* More privatization of the Education System

&gt; What as president would you seriously do about a massive overreach of big government into the classroom?  

&gt;JOHNSON: I'm promising to submit a balanced budget to Congress in the year 2013. That's a 43% reduction in federal spending. I am going to promise to advocate the abolishment of the federal Department of Education. The federal Department of Education gives each state 11 cents out of every dollar that every state spends, but it comes with 16 cents worth of strings attached. So what America does not understand is that it's a negative to take federal money. Give it to 50 laboratories of innovation, the states, to improve on, and that's what we'll see: dramatic improvement.

* More privatization of Health Care

&gt;Government-managed healthcare is insanity

&gt;Government has never managed any segment of the economy successfully. To expect that it can do so for health care--one of the largest segments--is insanity. Nowhere is it more important that the best possible services and products be available at affordable prices than in the area of health. Government simply cannot fulfill that mission. Rather, real competition, freedom to innovate and a working marketplace will provide Americans with the health care they want and will demand.  
&gt;To the extent that we, as a society, want to help those who are truly in need, that help can best be provided by the states--with any federal assistance coming in the form of block grants to be applied to best practices, innovative programs and the most efficient delivery of services.

* 1999: Vetoed raising minimum wage from $4.25/hour to $5.65

&gt;In 1999, Johnson vetoed a bill which would have raised the minimum wage from $4.25 per hour to $5.65. He also signed a law deregulating New Mexico's electricity market that allowed residential, small-business customers and schools to start shopping for their electricity supplier. He's argued that when a Democrat negotiates with labor unions through collective bargaining it's a ""giveaway"" instead of a negotiation.

"Terrible conditions in private prisons has been documented pretty extensively. Here's the most recent example: http://motherjones.com/politics/2016/06/cca-private-prisons-corrections-corporation-inmates-investigation-bauer

Looking at it purely as $76 per person per day vs. $56 is incredibly short-sighted and misses the forest for the trees. It's like clipping coupons but still buying filet mignon and telling yourself you're saving money. 

Let's set aside for now all the humanitarian concerns about how the prisoners are treated, and look at it purely as cold, rational, dollars-and-cents fiscal conservatives.

Someone goes to jail. If we want to calculate the cost imposed on society to keep them imprisoned, we can't just look at the length of their sentence, multiply it by the cost per day, and say we're done. We want the prison to be tough enough to be punishment for whatever crime they committed, but we also want to rehabilitate them, convince them that crime doesn't pay, so that when they're released they're able to get a job and an apartment and go back to being a productive part of the economy, paying their taxes, etc. If someone re-offends after their sentence is over and goes back to jail, that $20/day savings gets completely wiped out. 

Private prisons have *zero* incentive to rehabilitate inmates. They actually have a perverse incentive to not rehabilitate inmates, because that will keep ""business"" flowing. Note that I'm *not* claiming there's any grand conspiracy, no smoke-filled room with private prison execs who are scheming to keep prison populations high. Simply that the economic incentives in place for private prisons mean that the ""invisible hand"" will push them towards keeping prisons full, and lobbying to build more prisons. 

There's also always an incentive to cut costs even further - if those private prisons are charging the state $56 per inmate per day, but they can reduce their own costs to $40 per day, that's taxpayer money that goes directly to the people who own the private prison company. Like I said, corporate welfare. And there's plenty of evidence that private prisons engage in exactly that sort of cost-cutting (in fact, if they weren't cutting costs to the bare minimum, their management would be failing in their fiduciary responsibility to maximize shareholder value, and would be liable to be replaced with managers who will).

"I have seen a few posts here stating that you should rent it out as you will get a better return. I disagree.  You will be an absentee landlord, meaning that either you will need to commute here to manage the property, or else hire a management agency to mange the property for you. In that case, your annual return will be dropped *significantly* due to the overhead costs of having that management company.

Secondly, there are two big unknowns in this scenario. 1)The assumption that housing prices will continue to rise for several years, which while likely is not guaranteed. and 2)that the house will not suffer undue damage from tenants, which is unlikely, but vastly more likely than you would think.  Not to mention the costs of regular maintenance and upkeep, etc.

I would say this. Do not think of your house as an investment. It is not. It is a thing you buy to use, and there are always associated upkeeps cost with that. The fact that you happen to have been fortunately enough to purchase at a low price and are able to sell high is a bonus, really.  Take that free money and buy yourself a house in Montana with it, and be debt free quicker since you've been basically handed a golden egg.

It's lower risk overall, less overhead time dealing with a management company, less complicated on taxes, less stressfull because you won't have to screen tenants, manage deposits, etc. etc. etc.

You'll need to go into your chosen credit union with your ID, a piece of mail with your current address (unless your ID has your current address), and knowledge of your SSN. The whole process should take less than an hour, and you'll walk out new account information and maybe a debit card, depending on which credit union you choose. 

Once your credit union account is open, you can go to WF and tell them you're closing your account. You should get a cashier's check for the balance of your accounts, which you would then walk over to the credit union and deposit there.

There are a lot of good credit unions in the area. All the credit unions listed below participate in ""shared branching"" and the ATM ""co-op network,"" which means that no matter which credit union you're a part of, you can go into branches of other credit unions and use ATMs branded with other banks. Each of the credit unions below might have different perks that could apply to you. Peruse the websites and decide things like how many debit transactions do you usually have in a month, or will you have direct deposit going into the account. 

Some area credit unions:

* BECU
* Sound Credit Union
* Seattle Metropolitan Credit Union
* Verity Credit Union
* First Tech Federal Credit Union
* Alaska USA Federal Credit Union
* Salal Credit Union
* Harborstone Credit Union

Personally, I'm a member of Verity. I've heard good things about many of the others though. ",,,,billybk,North Beacon Hill,,1474825437,t5_2qhad,t3_54g2xf,t3_54g2xf,15,1476043593,0,0,d81io0y,Seattle,15,,flair

"I'd like to tell you the story of a British TV show called ""Have I Got News For You"".  This is a panel show consisting of four comedians (two regular ""captains"", two guests) and a regular host.  The purpose of the show was to essentially mock the news of the day in a sarcastic type of manner.

It's a very successful show and is currently on series 51 after 26 years in production.

Anyway, in series 24 there was a big scandal involving the permanent presenter Angus Deayton who was caught having sex with a prostitute in a hotel room and in possession of cocaine.  Now remember, the whole purpose of the show was for the presenter and the captains to crack smart - sometimes about the news and sometimes about the other guests.  The format was based around witty comments and ""banter"".

Angus Deayton refused to leave the show as he said that the evidence against him was sensationalised and he hadn't done anything wrong.  So he went back to filming.  However there was a problem; due to the nature of his allegations and this being a news show, the ENTIRE SHOW was hijacked by his indiscretions.  They no longer could function as a topical comedy show because Deayton's behaviour will always be an issue or an elephant in the room that they have to address.  It also meant that they couldn't act with any form of comedy about pushers and users if their presenter was a user.  The show's dynamic was crippled.

Eventually they had to sack Deayton just to save the incredibly successful multi year award winning show, as it was an issue that he could NEVER come back from in the dynamics of the show.  It doesn't matter whether it was right or wrong or context of the allegations, it just mattered that it hurt the show.

This is careless' problem that they don't get.  Their issues have overtaken the subreddit and the stickied post is all about them and their issues.  It doesn't matter whether they're true or false, it just matters that staying as a moderator is significantly damaging the community and as a moderator their first loyalty isn't to their ego or their righteous indignation but to the community itself.  

Every day these conversations happen and every day they will continue to happen until careless goes.  This will never go away.  The subreddit's usual business cannot take place any more and careless is so bothered about being seen as justified in their actions they don't seem to notice that Rome is burning around them.",,,,Swordee,,,1475074773,t5_2qhad,t3_54vzmc,t1_d85elvq,153,1476145319,0,1,d85jqcr,Seattle,153,,

"According to the city of seattle website on parking the majority of 2hr blocks allow up to 3hrs after 5pm when the paid parking goes to 8pm now. That means right now you can park at 5pm, pay, and be good for the whole night. I assume this practice will be continued which means you can arrive at 7pm and you would be able to park for the rest of the night. That sounds reasonable, especially if demand for parking is that high. 

I'll agree there arguments to be made that this will negatively impact people working who would tend to be on the lower economic scale and require a car because they can't afford to live close to work. I don't think it's a winning argument but it's better than complaining about limits on time

"&gt;One reason is, SDOT can save the similar sum of about $9 million, and still replace both sides, if it closes Fairview completely. Costs were approaching $34 million, but an accelerated 15-month timeline would help SDOT finish at or below the $27 million target. SDOT Director Scott Kubly said Friday that savings could amount to $17 million, in a letter to the City Council and Eastlake activists. A further breakdown was not available over the weekend.

Replacing both bridges at the same time saves more money, and if they want to run the streetcar over the bridge it must be replaced. 

The cost savings of strengthening the stronger bridge is about how much they are going to save by completing the project faster, so I can not say this for sure but I would guess the cost savings on strengthening the old bridge would be lost due to a longer time frame.

...I pay taxes, which helps pay for those services to be available to people. 

These taxes also help OTHER PEOPLE have access to things like roads, highways, public schools, the internet, healthcare, food, housing, clothes, fire departments, police departments, museums, air bags, smoke-free airplanes. These taxes are why people in wheelchairs are able to get into buildings, they are why  we have national parks, they are why your home's water pipes don't burst for no apparent reason.

I happily pay taxes so that OTHER PEOPLE have access to things I don't/won't/can't use because that's how society works. Someone else helped pay for me to get through highschool. Someone else helped pay for the road I used to get to the library, which someone else helped pay to run. Someone else helped pay for the law that requires seatbelts which is why my nose isn't crooked. Someone else helped pay for the amazing museums I got to see when I visited D.C. Someone else helped pay for the research that developed the internet.

Even if all the personal accusations are false, that doesn't mean that the over moderation and hair trigger bans are justified or how the community wants to be moderated.  And that's what the community cares about and as caretakers of the community, that's what every single one of the moderators should care about.

You fix this not by making a post addressing the personal accusations, but by making regular posts asking the community what they like and don't like about the moderation and the rules here and following through with actual changes.  By showing you want to be in touch with the community and evolve the moderation and rules with the community.

If the claims are false and you're doing a bad job of moderation, the community _still_ isn't going to care about the claims - their gripes are against the bad moderation.  The claims are just extra static.

If the changes the community is asking for aren't made, the community is going to fragment, and that's really worse for everybody.

"A couple reporters got in touch with me yesterday. Some updates below: 

There's a video and article here:
http://www.kiro7.com/news/local/photos-show-no-parking-signs-going-up-cars-being-towed-within-two-hours/449156061

And an article here:
http://komonews.com/news/local/alert-neighbor-catches-cars-getting-improperly-ticketed

Sounds like the tickets got dismissed and the drivers won't have to pay the towing fees. 

However, my girlfriend came home and spoke with one of the people who got towed. That person still had to figure out how to go to the towing company, do all the release paperwork, and then apparently their car was blocked in by other impounded cars and had to wait another hour for it to be accessible. Not cool. And as many of you shared yesterday, these sorts of things happen all the time without someone there to document it. Anyways, thanks for helping this get some attention.

Who knows, because we only have one year of data available for after it was passed. So we literally cannot say if it has had an effect or not.

Stop making grandiose statements that cannot be supported by the data we have, either way. I realize this is going to get downvoted to hell by the pro-gun side of this sub, but I'm really fed up of seeing the same of rhetoric completely unsupported by the data we have available (because we basically don't have any, and what we do have doesn't even fit that narrative) ",,,,OSUBrit,Bothell,,1474475477,t5_2qhad,t3_53tgg6,t1_d7w3h1h,29,1475911194,0,0,d7w6zxb,Seattle,29,,flair

"Rifles (of which ""assault rifles"" are a subset) were only used to commit 248 murders in 2014. The same year, 1,567 were murdered with knives, 435 were murdered with blunt objects, and 660 were murdered without a weapon. When we look at crime statistics, we can very clearly see that ""assault rifles"" play a negligible role in gun crime.

Even the department of Justice, in an analysis of the federal assault weapons ban that expired in 2004, stated that ""Should it be renewed, the ban’s effects on gun violence are likely to be small at best and perhaps too small for reliable measurement,""

Now I'm of the opinion that we do need to revise certain gun laws, but it's important that we take measure we can reasonably believe to have an effect. With the knowledge and data we have from other states, and the 1994 federal assault weapons ban, it's unreasonable to assume such a ban in WA would have a great enough effect on gun crime or violence to justify it. Either Bob Ferguson doesn't know that and is pushing this measure based on ignorance, or he does know that and is pushing this measure to score political brownie points with the fearful and ignorant.

"Mike Brown was shot and killed after stealing a box of cigars and shoving someone.  He was then shot once after attacking the police officer (wounded), and ran off.  Then the police officer unloaded 6 rounds into him, paused for 3 seconds, and unloaded 4 more rounds.  Just wondering why an unarmed man needs to be shot 10 times, over 150 feet from the source of the initial altercation.

Freddie Gray lived in Housing projects in Maryland for his entire young life, and was likely lead poisoned from the deteriorating condition of his unit.  Lead poisoning has been linked to propensity for criminal behavior later in life.  He was arrested for carrying a switchblade (reasonable), and somehow died of internal decapitation during the ride to the precinct.  He was already in custody and he died.

In Baton Rouge, a young black man (yes, a criminal) was selling CDs outside of a corner store.  Police came to move him along, and he refused.  The police then subdued him on the ground, had him handcuffed, and then shot him in the back for no reason.  Even if this man did have a gun, he was subdued.

In Minnesota, a young man was stopped for a traffic infraction.  He informed the officer he had a weapon, but was reaching for his registration and license.  The officer then shot him .  In front of his child and girlfriend.  The aftermath was videotaped by the girlfriend.  The officer made no attempt to secure medical attention for this man as he bled out and died.

There are definitely problems in the black community, and black folks will be the very first to admit that to you.  They're not saying there aren't problems.  They're saying that the disproportionate number of black men shot by police is something that should be of concern.  They're saying that their lives matter, too.  Black Lives Matter, Too.  That's the last word in their organization name that is implied by the name itself.  Your life matters, a black person's life matters, a hispanic person's life matters, a gay person's life matters, everyone's life matters.

1) People are more aware of the health benefits of a good night’s sleep. That’s led to shorter purchase cycles for new mattresses.

 2) Baby boomers are upgrading to fancier and more expensive mattresses.

"This is absolutely the correct answer. However, I think there needs to be more emphasis on the ""general ineptitude"" going on in this region. There is no fast lane/slow lane on any freeway. When a light turns green, it takes the average driver 1-5 seconds to press the fucken accelerator. It's not uncommon to see a meager 4 cars make it through a light. Oh and if someone is turning left? Do folks just drive around and proceed with their day? No. They wait until the left turner has completed their turn and then they go. If an emergency vehicle is approaching, people DO NOT get the fuck out of the way. They mosey to the right when it is absolutely undeniable that a vehicle with sirens blasting is directly behind them, blaring their horn. Clogging intersections is a passionate hobby in Seattle. When people see a wreck or even someone being pulled over, they slow down or needlessly pound their brakes, causing blockages for miles.

"""Certified"" service animals can be insanely expensive. I've heard of diabetic alert dogs, for example, being upwards of $20,000-$30,000. I know that in a lot of cases people don't have to pay the full price for a service animal, but it really varies depending on what sort of niche the service animal is filling. Because of the high cost of service animals, some people chose to train their own service animals, either on their own or with the assistance of a professional trainer, so they may not have any documentation to provide. Some, but not all, states have programs for certification. The ADA does not require licensing/certification by a state or local government for an animal to be considered a service dog.

A service dog is not required to wear any special vest or harness. The service animal may even be untethered entirely IF a leash/restraint interferes with its duties or if a person’s disability prevents the use of a restraint. The service animal MUST, however, be under the handler’s control at ALL times. If a service dog is acting up, they can be asked to leave.

"It's also obvious that there's plenty of economic growth in Seattle (something like 100k jobs have been added this year in the Seattle area alone), and it makes sense that tax increases (since apparently flat funding is the current way that metro gets paid, which is really dumb) follow, in amount, if not percent. 

An easy solution to this would be a tax increase that is based on a %, rather than a flat amount. Take it out of property taxes of people who refuse to increase height limits on buildings in Seattle if flat amounts are mandated. I'm looking right at you, Capital Hill.

Trying to recapture the Seattle of the 1980s-1990s is just harmful and selfish, as it limits the benefit of everyone. Increased demand on transportation, since growth cant happen locally, means longer commutes (less time with family, and more greenhouse gases burnt from cars).

This change WILL happen, whether in 5 years, guided by the neighborhoods of Seattle, or in 15 years, after the City siezes property under Eminent Domain, forcing the people who live there out (given compensation at their current base rate of the property), once Seattle reaches a housing crisis to make San Francisco look tame.

His boss is a turd but Jake is aite, he's on here all the time). So then Dori just goes thermonuclear reacting to something they found on Reddit and takes some really gross angle on it. He once said he thought if  people wanted to kill themselves jumping off the Aurora Bridge they should just die already, that suicide prevention was a waste of taxpayer money. 

Then Ron &amp; Don come on and they do their best to pull it out of the sewer Dori's gone down into. Ron &amp; Don will grab a couple things off Reddit and maybe react to what the other hosts have said earlier in the day. Ron &amp; Don are just really good guys though. Like, these are two dudes with hearts the size of Texas. After reading a couple reddit posts and offering some thoughtful, hearftul commentary, they might have Ed Troyer on to tell us that unfortunately, he's got another dead kid on his hands down there in Pierce County. Christ on a cracker, what I would go for one month without Ed Troyer having to tell us about another dead kid. 

But yeah, reading /r/Seattle out loud is basically KIRO Radio's M.O.

"Workers aren't interested in profit and greed. Most workers are paycheck to paycheck regardless of income.. They are interested in health insurance, mental health days, maternity leave, fair pay for fair work that allows them to feed their family and pay their bills and just live in their city.  
  
Many have none of this. And every  year the income gap expands, and every year more people fall into homelessness and despair which is increasingly more difficult to get out of.  

Why is Walmart allowed to rake in such profit while their full time employees go on food stamps? Is it so much to ask they simply arrange a fucking schedule so people can plan their lives? Get their kids to school, or the doctor or whatever they need to do without being harassed by their incompetent supervisor? And I'm sorry, but if you can't create a schedule, you're incompetent and you don't deserve your job.

My company rakes in billions every quarter, and you know what? We haven't had scheduling issues in decades. The complaints about over reach are absurd.

The vast majority of Americans are paycheck to paycheck, only one bad car problem away from ruin. Or losing you're job because you took your kid to the doctor, and oh guess what that supervisor changed your schedule, didn't tell you, and now your fired. 

The companies are the ones who utilize the most government resources by far, the onus of responsibility to all stakeholders is on them.

Demographics in the city are unlikely to sustain being as young as they are forever, and larger 2br-3br units can be used as roommate situations for budget conscious young people, and also for families/couples.

There's also some concerns about the sheer firepower of Reddit, and that you could get dozens or hundreds or thousands of eyes onto parts of Facebook where the users or participants may not want that attention. A lot of subreddits just restrict it to play it safe.""

Q: Why is there a dress code?
A: Since 1950, Canlis has lived up to its reputation as the swankest, dressiest restaurant in Seattle. Today, we maintain that tradition by requesting that **men wear a suit or sport coat** (though we don’t require it in many areas of the dining room). Casual attire? Not appropriate. The bottom line: Everyone likes to look good. In 1950, people knew fashion and loved to show it.

He called the cops at the house, the cop knocked on the door, an older gentleman answered, the cop asked if he had the stolen property, the guy denied it. The cop then said he couldn't get a search warrant from the GPS location app, said there was nothing he could do, and left.

"There's no limit to rent increases that can be imposed, particularly on month-to-month tenancies.

""Because rent control is illegal in Washington State (RCW 35.21.830) landlords can raise the rent as much as they see fit as long as they comply with the appropriate notice period and have not issued the notice to discriminate or retaliate against the tenant.""

The appropriate notice period is 30 days notice for month-to-month tenants (statewide rule) or 60 days notice for an increase of 10% or more in a 12-month period (only eligible for Seattle tenants).

"Rifles (of which ""assault rifles"" are a subset) were only used to commit 248 murders in 2014.  The same year, 1,567 were murdered with knives, 435 were murdered with blunt objects, and 660 were murdered without a weapon.  When we look at crime statistics, we can very clearly see that ""assault rifles"" play a negligible role in gun crime.

Even the department of Justice, in an analysis of the federal assault weapons ban that expired in 2004, stated that ""Should it be renewed, the ban’s effects on gun violence are likely to be small at best and perhaps too small for reliable measurement,""

Now I'm of the opinion that we do need to revise certain gun laws, but it's important that we take measure we can reasonably believe to have an effect.  With the knowledge and data we have from other states, and the 1994 federal assault weapons ban, it's unreasonable to assume such a ban in WA would have a great enough effect on gun crime or violence to justify it.

"So I recently drove from CA back to Seattle. Here's some of the things that stand out from that trip:

Unsafe undertaking: left lane campers annoy everyone, but where it gets dangerous is when there is traffic but the road speed is still high and complete idiots decide that the line that has formed in the left lane (we're talking like 15 cars in line here or more) isn't for them and do wild, unsafe undertaking manoeuvres (sometimes rapidly cross 3 lanes back and forth) to tuck into a gap that isn't close to wide enough for them. All to move one car length further up. Rinse and repeat.

Small gaps: related to above, people often leave smaller gaps because of wanting to shut out idiot drivers doing unsafe undertaking etc. But in general tailgating and just lack of concentration leads to more accidents. Saw this yesterday, when a Honda fit was forced to dive into the HOV lane because the van in front of them slammed on their brakes in stop-and-go traffic.

Moving between lanes: seriously, rapid moving between lanes in traffic is a nightmare, people pulling out into faster moving traffic from stop-and-go lanes. So, SO dangerous.

Zipper merging: I think getting information on how zipper merging actually benefits everyone would be huge. People don't know about it and so they close gaps and force people to make unsafe merges because they view people as ""jumping the line"" or something. This is ESPECIALLY true of the NB I-5 express lanes entrance, it's a total mess because of this.

Also while we're at it. Yesterday while at the I-5 on ramp at 405 in Lynnwood I was overtaken by 18 cars in the HOV on ramp before I got to the meter. Fully 2 of them had 2+ visible passengers. You need to do something about this. HOV lane abuse it beyond ridiculous at this point.

"[I must confess that over the past few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to ""order"" than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says: ""I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action""; who paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for another man's freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for a ""more convenient season."" Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection.

"It's been a long history of high capacity rail transit for our region. Here's some of the highlights: 

* 1912: Voters reject the [Bogue Plan](http://65.media.tumblr.com/ff9dbc6909864e4fd9a4849c5cf06952/tumblr_o3f5iy80XZ1r54c4oo1_1280.jpg) which ""would have built train lines up the wazoo."" (Go Cougs)
* 1920's: [Rapid Transit Plan](http://www.seattle.gov/cityarchives/exhibits-and-education/find-of-the-month/2008-find-of-the-month-archive#jun08) with three subways proposed
* 1939: [Interurban shuts down](http://www.historylink.org/File/5341)
* 1940: Trolley buses begin operation in Seattle
* 1968: King County voters reject [Forward Thrust's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_Thrust) rapid transit proposal, a ballot measure that would have built an [X-shaped BART-like system](https://www.flickr.com/photos/viriyincy/3488685623) in our region.
* 1970: Second rejection of Forward Thrust rapid transit proposal due to worsening local economy (Boeing Bust). Federal money goes to Atlanta instead.
* 1981: Metro 1990 plan leads to The Bus Tunnel and various other transit improvements
* 1985: [Metro's rapid transit plan](http://www.washington.edu/uwired/outreach/cspn/Website/Images/Mullins%20images/1985system.jpg). Sure looks familiar, doesn't it?
* 1986: Bus Tunnel construction begins
* 1990: The Bus Tunnel opens
* 1995: Voters reject Sound Move v1
* 1996: Voters approve [Sound Move v2](http://www.soundtransit.org/About-Sound-Transit/News-and-events/Reports/Sound-Move), Sound Transit created
* 1997: [Seattle Monorail Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Monorail_Project) gets [voter approval](https://youtu.be/lHD6CfqcDnY?t=3m51s).
* 1999: Voters pass [I-695](https://ballotpedia.org/Washington_Voter_Approval_for_Tax_Increases,_Initiative_695_(1999)), causing significant damage to [Washington's budget](http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2000/04/03/initiative-695-haunts-state-government-in-washington), including capital spending on transportation. [I-695 Headlines](http://old.seattletimes.com/special/i695/)
* 2000: [Sounder Commuter rail service begins to Tacoma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sounder_commuter_rail)
* Early 2000's: [dark years for Sound Transit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Link_light_rail), nearly collapses, Link significantly scaled back. Monorail project gains significant momentum.
* 2002: [Joni Earl](http://crosscut.com/2015/10/how-joni-earl-saved-light-rail/) comes in, Sound Transit gets its shit back together, construction starts on Central Link. If anyone deserves a statue to commemorate their leadership, its Joni. It's no exaggeration to say she saved us and Sound Transit.
* 2003: Tacoma Link, the first piece of light rail, opens.
* 2005: After a *5th* public vote, Seattle Monorail Project collapses after everyone realized it was run by people who didn't know what they were doing.
* 2006: Voters approve [Transit Now](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_County_Metro#Transit_Now), funding Metro and the RapidRide program.
* 2007: Voters reject [Roads And Transit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roads_and_Transit) because of the road component. [SLUT opens to the public.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Lake_Union_Streetcar)
* 2008: Sound Transit comes back with [ST2](http://seattletransitblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/regionalmap.jpg) and it's approved by voters ([more info](http://www.soundtransit.org/About-Sound-Transit/News-and-events/Reports/ST2-project-details)). Economy tanks and significantly impacts budgets of every agency; scaling back both capital investments and operations.
* 2009: Central Link &amp; Airport Link open
* 2010ish: [Bellevue dicks around](http://www.seattlemet.com/articles/2010/2/9/afternoon-fizz-wallace-hires-consultants-to-push-vision-line) and delays East Link by two years. Kemper Freeman and Tim Eyman (asshole) do all sorts of legal things to try and stop East Link, but ultimately fail.
* 2011: Boom really picks up speed and the need for rail transit becomes more apparent. Acceleration of [serious ST3 planning](http://www.soundtransit.org/Projects-and-Plans/High-Capacity-Transit-Corridor-Studies) begins.
* 2012: [Mayor Mike McGinn](https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/597124681/McGinn_Photo.jpg) pushes hard for [Seattle light rail](http://www.westseattleherald.com/2013/06/13/news/mcginn-sound-transit-will-study-light-rail-feasib), other city politicians don't play ball, but he gets consolidation prize of [Ballard-Downtown High Capacity Study](http://www.soundtransit.org/Projects-and-Plans/Ballard-transit-expansion-study) and the first major breakthrough in Seattle-focused rail planning since the 1960's.
* 2011-2015: A lot of behinds-the-scenes work many don't see, but there are several public outreach sessions to gather feedback!
* Early 2014: [King County voters say hell no to more Metro](https://seattletransitblog.com/2014/05/07/map-of-king-county-prop-1-results-by-precinct/)
* Late 2014: [Seattle voters say hell yes to more Metro](http://www.seattle.gov/transit/about-prop-1)
* Early 2015: Sound Transit gets approval from Washington State Legislature for more taxing authority to pass ST3 after getting together a presentable plan. Without this, there'd be no ST3.
* Late 2015: ST3 planning starts to solidify, and public outreach starts. SUrprise surprise it looks a lot like the X-shaped rail concepts we've been studying for a century. Seattle voters approve a nearly $1 billion transportation prorgam; [Move Seattle](http://www.seattle.gov/transportation/moveSeattle.htm).
* 2016: University Link opens $200M under budget and to great fanfare (despite the [haters](http://www.seattletimes.com/author/seattle-times-editorial-board/)). Public vote for ST3 is in November, two years ahead of what many of us expected due to *incredible* regional growth.

Future, as approved by voters

* 2016: [Angle Lake opens September 24th!](http://www.anglelake2016.org/)
* 2018: 122 new Link light rail vehicles will be delivered. 
* 20??: [Tacoma Link Expansion opens](http://www.soundtransit.org/tacomalinkexpansion)
* 2021: [Northgate Link](http://www.soundtransit.org/northgatelink) set to opening, adding 3 stations and 4.3 miles of light rail.
* 2023: Three major ST2 projects come on line: [Lynnwood Link](http://www.soundtransit.org/Lynnwoodextension), [East Link](http://www.soundtransit.org/eastlink), and [Kent/Des Moines extension](http://www.soundtransit.org/Projects-and-Plans/Federal-Way-Link-Extension). This closes out the ST2 capital program.

"Wrong, reductive, and unsupported. Stop buying the narrative that Johnson is crazy and read for yourself. 

There is a lot of room for reasonable disagreement with things like FairTax, but don't call it crazy. 

&gt;We need to get rid of the income tax. Giant, slow corporations spend their money on lobbying because tax avoidance is where their profit is. General Electric earned $14.2 billion in 2010 and paid zero taxes on it. Why? Because it has the lobbyists to get subsidies and tax breaks.
But those mom-and-pop stores? The tech startups? The nimble new corporations with new ideas and new visions for our economy? They pay as much as 35 cents on every dollar they earn. When the company pays its employees, the government taxes that money again. We need to stop taxing work, savings and investment. I advocate removing all income taxes, all capital-gains taxes, and replacing them with a consumption tax, kind of a national sales tax called the Fair-tax.

I happen to agree. There is so much waste in the IRS and it still doesn't really work for the low and middle class. 

There is no reason to think that he would dissolve the EPA. This is more misinformation. He has never said anything about dissolving the EPA (at least not recently). He supports a carbon emissions tax. He supported clean water and state superfund initiatives. He has always been in favor of endagered species legislation. Saying he would dissolve the EPA (and the implication therein that he does not want environmental regulation) is patently and woefully false. 

Maybe you should go to a Johnson rally to really be informed. Feel free to disagree with what he says, but at least listen. He's a surprisingly rational guy. 

Edit: he's also shown to be willing to change his position on things you might not expect. Previously on record as against trade regulations, here is a recent quote of his on NAFTA:

&gt;He did sound a little squishy on trade in a March 2011 interview when he said that ""So much of the legislation that we pass isn't really free market at all. It's touted as free market, when the reality ends up to be very corporate. The reality ends up to be corporatism. I was always looking at business legislation from the standpoint of having it affect everyone equally as opposed to big business being further advantaged. So many of these treaties--NAFTA being one--the criticism of NAFTA should be rooted in the fact that big business became even bigger business""

"I'm glad you asked! I've noticed some things that really make me go ??? 

1. No one zipper merges here - it's a race for the merging cars to get as far ahead of people in line/traffic as possible and then cut in at the opportune moment. It's so incredibly frustrating to sit in traffic while people go around, merging far ahead due to poorly planned lane merges. For example, 15th Avenue West as it becomes Elliott Ave during morning rush hour. The cars coming from the Magnolia bridge use the bus lane on the right for a half mile instead of merging. Hwy 99 Southbound near the southern end of the Viaduct is similarly bad - people totally ignore the 40 mph speed limit, fly down the road doing 60 and then have to merge with cars in the left lane, while the right lane comes to a total standstill before the S. Atlantic exit. 

2. Use of a blinker seems to be optional here. I regularly see people cut from the left to the right to make an exit or on ramp with no blinker at all. When I look directly at the driver they are on their phone, or applying lipstick, or just generally staring straight ahead into bad-driver space, oblivious to the dangers they are causing. What is going on in drivers ed? 

3. Cars parked facing the opposite direction of travel on residential streets. Before you turn down the road you hesitate and ask yourself if it is a one way? Nope, just random parking...Any other city/state and you'll get a ticket. That hesitation means you stay in the intersection a second longer; maybe you get hit, or you don't see a pedestrian. EDIT: Furthermore, some 4-way residential intersections have no signage whatsoever - who has the right of way here? How do you see down the road if parked cars are blocking the corner, within the often-ignored '30 ft. away' rule? 

4. Two way streets with cars parked on either side = one lane street where you play chicken to see who goes ahead. 

5. I drive the mountain passes frequently and it seems more often than not people are getting in major wrecks near Cle Elum and North Bend, and on Hwy 2 and other mountain roads. I see the state patrol on occasion but maybe they should do more to enforce the speed limit?

The only in real life thing I've done with this subreddit was play on teh softball team like 4 or 5 years ago. I don't go to game night or meetups or whatever cause I don't live in capitol hill like the other 95% of yall. But softball was fun and we somehow won the first game in the playoffs when a couple of us begged wives/girlfriends to play cause we needed enough females. JohnL set that shit up I recall. Careless was on the team and I don't remember him other than being a normal guy who played softball and drank beer afterwards and it's all good.

I got two young kids so I just use reddit to poke around and kill time waiting for one of em to poop or whatever. So it's hard for me to follow all the drama and nonsense. But this sub the last couple days has been crazy... and the ""new"" other sub is a bunch of self celebratory stuff that's just not super interesting to me right now. Hopefully both or at least one of em calm down. I just wanna know basic stuff about what's goin on in the city is all. 

I gather that some of the ""other"" people are a little TOO enthusiastic in my opinion about the exodus... I'm not in that clique and I can't really follow everything. But man, you gotta let it go. AmericanDerp and JohnL as mods both seem like they're trying to do a good job. I think they're good for r/seattle.  Maybe some of the other mods are too and I just don't know about it. Careless part of you clearly wants to be good for the sub too and I appreciate it... but this stuff's all just gone too far and its too personal and if these people don't matter to you, if all the accusations really are lies, then just walk away man. let is wash off you, it ain't nothing.

The US doesn't have to be like this, Finland just 2 decades ago had a much worse educational system than what we have, and they cleaned up their system to the point that the best school to go to is your neighborhood school. We need to properly fund our schools and abstract educational funding to the federal level, while also cleaning up our school districts at the local level.

So if you're listening to the radio and a show you don't like comes on, switch over to PublicRadioFan.com and see [what's playing right now.](http://www.publicradiofan.com/cgibin/whatson.pl?when=now)  Or, if you missed the second half of This American Life, don't worry, because [dozens of other stations are running it](http://www.publicradiofan.com/cgibin/program.pl?programid=28) throughout about 15 hours a day all weekend, plus much of Friday night, so you can catch it where you left off.   Can't find any station that's still running the marvelous but long-cancelled show Schickele Mix?  Neither can I, but back when WNYC was streaming it, it could be found on PublicRadioFan.com.

I'm not affiliated with the site, but I would be willing to affiliate myself with the site PublicRadioFanFan.com.

"The Youtube video has been stabilized, but otherwise hasn't been altered.

At the time, the wirecutter [review of dashcams](http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-dash-cam/) liked the G1W the best.  I bought [this one from eBay](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Full-HD-1080P-G1W-2-7-LCD-Car-DVR-Camera-Recorder-G-sensor-H-264-Night-Vision-/310752336819) for $45 with free shipping from China.

When it arrived the suction cup mount was defective.  It was only $45 so I didn't bother reporting it as arriving damaged.  Instead I bought [this rear-view mirror mounting kit](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0102CK1BS) from Amazon for $12.

I also bought [this 12 volt to USB power converter](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CGQME5U) from Amazon for $8 so I could hard wire it into the car power.  My rear-view mirror has switched 12 volts on it which I tapped into for camera power.

I used a normal microSD card for a while but it died pretty quickly due to the constant writing.  I bought [this heavy duty 16GB card](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B013CP5F90) for $11 on amazon.com and it's been working great for the last 9 months.

Pretty cheap insurance if you ask me.  If I had it to do over again I would buy the version of the G1W that uses a capacitor instead of an internal battery or I would try out one of the cameras that the wirecutter now is suggesting.

I was definitely a bit out of line but I was quite upset because shit, I thought there was a rule against personal attacks. but turns out that doesn't apply to a mod. oops.

anyways, I got banned, I messaged the mods apologizing and asking how long my ban was for, told (in ..not very nice words) permanent, and then muted.

I got a couple messages from several other people who had similar experiences, and this mod inteprets their ""helpful critique is allowed"" rule as ""if I think you did something I don't like, or your tattoo isn't 'good' I can be as rude as I want"". Since he's a mod, not a lot to do. 

I, and a lot of the other people who have experienced this guy, use /r/tattoo (no S) which is much friendlier, and doesn't have a mod who apparently knows how all tattoos should look and is OBVIOUSLY objectively correct about aesthetic choices /s

It may not be om Murray's plan right now to laser focus that assistance, but it still seems like a bad idea to just make a statement that it's all good, and we'll spend lots of money trying to help *everyone*. I imagine there are plenty of people who are making the choice to live that way, whether it's the lack of obligations that impede their drug habit or people just wanting to live differently.

Coverage of the BLM movement is definitely used as fuel in the racial fire but it's also used as a way to demonize those who stand up and protest the system.

Construction company rang my doorbell and tried to tell me I couldn't park in front of my house one morning around 6:30.  He said he'd have my car towed if I didn't move it.  I told him he wasn't towing shit.  He pointed to the sign his employee put up that morning and said, ""this sign means you can't park here, or you'll get towed.""  I told him, ""I have on camera, your employee [pointing at him] showing up last week, taking out a sign, looking around, putting it back in his truck, and leaving without putting anything down.  I can probably check my camera feed to see when he put it down, and the 72 hour clock will start from that point.  You can tow my car, yes, but when the officer shows up, I will have printed out the rules before he arrives, show him the footage, and call the Department of Building Inspections.  Your job will then be halted for 72 hours.""  

The jackass did call parking enforcement, I did have to prove the signs just went up, and the officer told them they couldn't enforce it.  I called DBI, and they said it was a city project.

"If your business is running on such razor thin margins that you can't plan out a 2 week schedule, you might want to reexamine your practical skill set and do a little brushing up to operate in a more fiscally responsible manner. Otherwise you are just another person in business, that doesn't really understand business. 

As far as businesses going to full automation, good luck with that. I won't spend one thin dime in your robot shop and a lot of other people won't either. Automation is a little harder than it sounds. I know everyone is impressed with all the robotic prototypes being built but the thing is, they aren't available. Robotics is expensive, requires a significant investment and automation requires a lot of maintenance. I retired from a facility that was always trying to find new ways to automate job functions, they failed across the board and they had very deep pockets. The likes of Siemens, McDonnell Douglas and several other major electronics wizards could not get the job done. It was faster and simpler to move product with manually operated machinery. The system would bog down with increased work load and stop functioning. That was a 55 million dollar boondoggle, mostly paid by Siemens trying to make an automated system work and then turning it over to Lockheed, who finally gave up. The whole nationwide automated system was phased out almost as quick as management could make it happen.

"The reason for the ""micro-housing crisis"" in NYC that you cite was extreme poverty. The alternative for these people was homelessness.

We live in a society that is 10X more wealthy than the US in 1870 [1]. Modern micro-housing units are incredibly luxurious compared to flop-houses. The comparison is very misleading. In the early 20th century, entire families regularly lived in houses smaller than 1000 sqft. 

New micro-housing units only add to the available housing options. Nobody is forced to live in these units. Those that do live in these units vacate existing housing (or for new Seattleites, they don't take existing housing) which drives down the price for everyone.

I simply cannot fathom an argument against these units that makes sense. ""That apartment is too small, it makes me uncomfortable"" is a poor argument since the person choosing to live in the micro-apartment clearly prefers it over other options.

"A Washingtonian, a Californian, and a Texan were out camping. They were lazing around the campfire when the Texan pulled out a bottle of tequila and after taking a couple of swallows, threw the bottle in the air, pulled out his six-shooter, and neatly shot the bottle. The Californian noted that there was still some tequila left in the bottle, but the Texan replied, 'That's okay, we have plenty of tequila where I come from.'

The Californian promptly brought out his bottle of White Zinfandel, took two swallows, threw it up in the air, and shot it with a Glock 9mm pistol with the 17-round magazine, stating: 'We have plenty of wine where I come from.'

The Washingtonian took all this in and finally opened a bottle of Henry's Blue Boar Irish Ale. He downed the entire bottle, threw it up in the air, shot the Californian with a 12-guage Mossberg he kept around for the birds, and deftly caught the bottle. The Texan's jaw dropped nearly to his silver belt buckle and his eyes opened nearly as wide.

"In the 90's that analogy actually worked for parts of Europe, but they made some demographic choices that broke the social contract which allowed for that model.  Very harsh gun control can work like that in strict monocultures like Japan or what used to be the Scandinavian countries.  Their laws still haven't caught up to reality, and when you have net immigration flows from areas of the world with high firearms ownership then the model breaks down.  Imagine if Tokyo was suddenly flooded with NRA members from the deep south.  Yes, Japan would still have ""strict gun laws"" but undoubtedly that cohort would come along with a cultural need for protection, and if Japan was too afraid of offending them to enforce those gun laws then you'd have what the EU is going through now.

"This decision by the Des Moines City Council is very stupid. But first a bit of backstory.

As some people may know, Des Moines is a dying city. Businesses have left, buildings are empty, and places such as The Dollar Store are coming into a what was a small community. Recently, the Des Moines City Council has been attempting to reinvigorate the local economy and bring more people into Des Moines; new restaurants, the weekend farmers market, concerts at the Marina, food trucks. 

However, Des Moines is still dying despite their efforts. Pokemon Go has provided basically a free opportunity to bring in more people to Des Moines. People who will eat at restaurants, buy gas and return to Des Moines because the Marina has many PokeStops. However, these people that are coming to play Pokemon Go are teenagers. For the City Council, kids are apparently the type of people they don't want in their community. Instead, they want to cater to the elder community.

For the city to be desperate to attract more tourism and basically try and reject a tourism opportunity is incredibly stupid. Beggars cannot be choosers. The Des Moines City Council desperately needs more progressive thinkers. 

The ironic part of this story is that the City Council wants to  add more restaurants to the Marina which would simply encourage more (possibly drunk) people to hang out at the Marina. ",,,,hellarad,,,1472858403,t5_2qhad,t3_50tsk8,t3_50tsk8,27,1475283530,0,0,d77elta,Seattle,27,,

"I have seen this, although my observation has been that it is folks who live in the area, and have the opportunity to buy up near by properties for slight refurbishment into multi family rentals.

The last paragraph gives the incentive to purchase with an LLC.
in case of bankruptcy/ issue w creditors, it is more difficult to seize assets.

But as it is easy to check purchase price of property, and when a month or two later they are renting it out for an amount that would cover their purchase price in as little as 8 years, it kinda makes me hope for the bottom to fall out of the market.

""The assessor’s records do not indicate the country of origin of the LLC members.

Homes owned by LLCs are spread throughout King County, and range from very modest to palatial. The average assessed value for LLC-owned single-family homes in Seattle was $560,00 in 2015. In Bellevue, it was $830,000.

Hempelmann says investors from around the globe began to take notice of Seattle in the early 2000s.

“There’s no question that for the last decade or more, Seattle has been seen as a very good place to invest,” he said, “in part because the economy here is so vibrant, and the job growth is so strong.”

The biggest increase in investment homes happened during the housing-bubble era, when Seattle’s market was red hot. In 2008, just before the bubble burst, the number of LLC-owned homes jumped by more than 1,600.

“People were buying homes left and right and flipping them,” Hempelmann said, explaining the rise in LLCs. “Obviously it dropped off dramatically during the Great Recession, but it’s back on again.”

Last year saw the biggest spike in LLC ownership in King County since the start of the recession — an increase of more than 800 from the previous year.

Investors buy properties through an LLC for a variety of reasons, the most important being the limit on personal liability for business debts and claims. And you get that corporate-like protection from creditors without having to pay a corporate tax.""",,,,MrsWhatsit-75,,,1474924681,t5_2qhad,t3_54modd,t3_54modd,10,1476085668,0,0,d836ycl,Seattle,10,,

Then I was prescribed oxycontin and percocet and a bunch of other shit for 1.5 years when I was 27 and quit cold turkey and had incredible withdrawals for 8 days, but my mind was made up.

I had worse withdrawals from venlafaxine, a nerve pain med, it took months of trying to quit from 300mg/day and basically I had to set aside 3 days to just lay in bed and wish I was dead.

Sunday evening we saw a Seal Pup haul itself out of the water in Golden Gardens Park.

We told the various people who were getting really close to take cellphone pictures of it to back off and let it be. As folks moved away, it pulled itself further up the beach to get out of the tide.

So, consider this a PSA about leaving Seal Pups alone. Pretty much everyone else we talked to there thought it was sick or abandoned or something.

If I were allowed to make the rules, I would only ban full automatic guns and focus on sentencing. We placed mandatory minimum sentences on drug offenses and while the long term effects may not have been completely ideal, it certainly did curb crime.

"Don't be selfish. Of course our home prices will appreciate when the faucets of corrupt cash come pouring in.

All of this ignores the ethical and moral side of things as well. Why should we help launder some scumbags dirty money? Virtually none of the capital flight from China is legitimate, it's from bribes, skimming, shady land and business deals, it's all dirty money which is why they want so desperately to launder it out of China and into a ""safe"" country (in other words, a country that isn't going to prosecute them for being a corrupt scammer).

"It was an interesting idea but it came at a time when we were all just a little wary of big expensive projects. 

The first vote on whether or not to build what is now Safeco Field was on that same ballot and got rejected. 

I just remember the political climate at the time, the general sentiment was along the lines of ""These are neat ideas but christ this is expensive."" 

The stadium got railroaded through the state legislature and built anyway because baseball had political power and cohesive lobbying power that the Commons idea lacked. 

Seattle/King County politics tend to swing on a pendulum between ""Yeah let's build big cool expensive shit"" and ""whoa Nellie, we gotta reign this in and say no."" 

Forward Thrust in the late 60s was a major era of ""let's build shit."" We got a lot of parks, public pools and good infrastructure there. That phase ended with the defeat of the proposed light rail system that Uncle Sam would have paid 75% of. King County voters rejected paying the 25% cost to build the system, and instead the funds went to Atlanta to build MARTA. Senator Slade Gorton called it ""the stupidest vote the people of Seattle ever cast."" It was just the wrong moment -- taxpayer fatigue was too high. 

It's hard to look into a crystal ball and say what's going to happen next -- my training is in history not political science -- but based on Seattle history I'd say Bertha does not bode well for  hitting the gas pedal on big expensive projects right now. Taxpayer fatigue seems to be inching up.

"&gt; Allow competition.

Upgrade Seattle's proposal is to build an open-access network, much like roads.  The city owns and maintains the underlying infrastructure while private companies lease capacity on it to serve their customers.

We did this in the mid-90s with the Telecommunications Act of 1996.  Telephone companies were required to lease their copper infrastructure to competitors at cost plus a defined profit.  Internet providers you still know today--Earthlink, RoadRunner, and Speakeasy (a Seattle-based ISP that lasted for years)--got their start like this.  But, in 2002, the FCC under President Bush decided that ""sufficient competition"" existed and rolled back those rules.  As expected, competition collapsed now that third-party providers didn't have open access to the copper network.

(Why did we require this for copper?  Because the copper system was, by and large, built by the Bell System with taxpayer money.)

This proposal is basically the same thing but with fiber, owned by the city, and supported with public sector borrowing but paid back by fees charged to use the network.",,,,somenewuser,Central Area,,1472760462,t5_2qhad,t3_50of37,t1_d75u4l0,34,1475242706,0,0,d75uflp,Seattle,34,,flair

"Where do we put expanded roadways? Does the neighborhood in which I live have to be torn down? Will it cost billions and take 20 years to add a lane, just like it is on SR 520? How will we widen arterials in downtown and throughout our region where we've built up to roads? Do we need another huge roadway tunnel? These are legitimate questions that must be answered prior to expanding roadway capacity.

It's not as simple as claiming piss-poor planning. In reality, until 2011ish, this insane growth was completely unpredictable and unprecedented in our region's history, and we've had to play catch up. We've been planning and building for some time. Sound Move 1996 is mostly done while Sound Transit 2 was passed in 2008 and is under construction. Sound Move and ST2 included money to study and perform light design on many corridors; several of which are in ST3.

If you want to talk hard numbers, [the plan (PDF)](http://www.seattle.gov/Documents/Departments/ParksAndRecreation/PoliciesPlanning/CommunityCenterStrategicPlan9-1-16.pdf) says the cost of dropping the fee is $174,500/year. To put it another way, $0.27 per resident.

"It sounds like the other half of this Northgate tool recovery/citizen's arrest story.

http://komonews.com/news/local/spd-theft-investigation-escalates-to-violent-failed-citizens-arrest
&gt;From Jan. 21-30, Seattle police fielded multiple reports of tool theft from construction sites in Northeast Seattle, reports say. Surveillance footage showed that a red Ford Bronco may have been linked to one of the burglaries.  One of the affected contractors noticed on Feb. 2 that some familiar tools were listed for sale on OfferUp, a Bellevue-based resale app. A group of involved contractors met the next day at the Seattle Police Department's North Precinct to consult with a detective about meeting the tool seller.  That night, one of the alleged victims contacted police to report that she had arranged to meet the seller at Northgate Mall. The seller claimed he would show up in a red Ford Bronco. The caller tried ""repeatedly"" to request a cop to assist with contacting and arresting the seller but was unsuccessful.  A pair of reported victims met with the seller about 11:10 p.m. at the mall parking lot, police reports say. While they looked over the suspected stolen tools, another involved contractor stepped in, removed the keys from the Bronco and informed the seller he was making a citizens' arrest.

&gt;Citizens' arrests are technically legal, but Seattle police advise people to leave arrests to the cops.

&gt;The seller engaged in a physical struggle with the contractor for the keys until the seller reached into the Bronco and pulled out what appeared to be a black handgun, according to the probable cause.  The seller pointed the gun at the contractors, who reportedly gave back the keys and stepped away. The man with the gun jumped back into the Bronco and drove away, allegedly waving his gun and yelling, ""You want some of this?""",,,,ChefJoe98136,West Seattle,,1473374287,t5_2qhad,t3_51tp1o,t3_51tp1o,63,1475468277,0,0,d7eut6h,Seattle,63,,flair

"And this is relevant - how? ""Gun violence"", ""crimes involving firearms"", ""gun homicides"" are meaningless buzzwords invented by gun control activists.

Tell me about reduction in overall homicide rates - of which there is none (here, for example, are stats for Seattle: http://www.seattle.gov/seattle-police-department/crime-data/crime-dashboard), all the numbers of all the recent years are within half a standard deviation from each other.

Yeah, sure, ""not enough time"". However, there are states which enacted similar regulation a long time ago - CO for example - where after 10 years there is still, apparently, ""not enough time"" to show anything.

By the way, the reports you are citing are very interesting. The third link (2013) does not point to the document that has either the word ""firearms"" or the number that your cite. The difference between 2014 and 2015: there was a robust growth in overall number of violent crimes, however, the number of crimes committed by firearms, knives, and blunt objects all dropped, by roughly the same rate. Unless you claim that I594 somehow impacted the rate of violence by clubs, I suspect there is a reporting difference in there somewhere that is responsible for the difference, not the law (which by the way is not even enforced).",,,,verylittlefinger,,,1474478975,t5_2qhad,t3_53tgg6,t1_d7w7pif,12,1475913147,0,0,d7w9wk3,Seattle,12,,

"ST III is what, 5 billion dollars? 3 billion?  

Lets say we take 500 million of that and buy 12,500 autonomous cars.  And then we take a billion of that and endow a maintenance facility for them.
(1 billion at 6% return = 60 million dollar budget perpetually available for no additional cost - EVER)

Pay the mechanics $75k a year, with 25k a year for benefits and taxes
Pay the administrators $150k a year
add some additional staff.  call it 30 million a year in payroll
30 million a year for other stuff - advertising, internet, whatever.  

12,500 cars would give you a capacity of (4 passengers * 12500 = 50,000 passengers)

figure 10% of the cars would be broken at any given time, so 45,000 passengers

"The problem is people within the social movements that are trying to make progress on actual social issues are unable or unwilling to call out this kind of behavior as being destructive/harmful because by calling out a woman like this you will get yourself ostracized and attacked just like she did to this guy. The loudest and quickest to call someone a negative term is the one with the power right now and not the people with the best ways to actually help others and accomplish goals. 

I say this as someone who believes in a lot of these causes, but finds that a lot of people like this woman are given a lot of power and no accountability within the communities fighting for social justice. This pushes away and alienates people from listening/considering the ideas of change and harms the causes more than anything else and if the people within these groups could solve these problems on their own they would, but no - they need to convince others to support the causes as well and this is NOT the way to do that.

This guy is a good example - he seems like an average, hard-working, middle America guy who probably works hard for his family and probably doesn't make a lot of money and who clearly cares about his daughter and supports the police because they put her in jail and got her clean...but what if someone sat down with him and talked to him about ways funding for police could have helped her WITHOUT jail and without giving her a criminal record, or about the way that addiction is being fueled by the failed drug war policy, unregulated prescription pills being handed out like candy from doctors while cops are spending their time in minority communities, and so on and so forth. 

This is a regular dude who could have been very open to ideas like that, instead this woman is allowed to act in such a manner and just makes such ideas seem the ideas of people with no concept of reality. Within certain communities, she is being supported and hailed as hero for standing up to this guy. That is self-destructive to the idea of spreading awareness and trying to actually craft solutions to problems. But as it stands right now, if a person was to challenge this woman in the moment and say that her behavior was extremely inappropriate she would have likely started yelling at that person as well and calling them sexist/other terms and then THAT person would be ostracized and or turned on by others.

- It turns out it wasn't your front door, but your neighbor's in the same house
- You opened the door and confronted the man (where was the man? was he outside still trying to get in? was he inside your neighbor's?)
- The guy attacked you and you yelled for help
- You didn't want to use the box cutter because you didn't want him to bleed on you
- You wrestle back and forth and there's a witness who is watching
- The cops come and the guy takes off
- The man comes back with a shirt on and a baton 
- The cops watch him flail around (what does this mean?)
- The man goes into an empty sushi place
- The police ask you to id the man but you can't, even though you confronted and wrestled with him earlier, but you are also sure the same man put on a shirt and returned with a baton

"What I'm trying to elude to is that growth of Spokane with easier access to Seattle would be good for Seattle in the long run. If you allow spokane to expand to businesses that need some access to Seattle yet don't **need** to be in the city proper you'd reduce congestion and skyrocketing property prices.  
  
Tech and commercial organizations (management as opposed to storefront) would have the ability and easy access to land for expansion into the area where there is actually room for more people, reducing the already over stressed reliance on the Seattle Tacoma core.  
  
It also reduces the cost of industrial shipping to the rest of the country by a significant amount.  
  
All of this takes long term planning and would benefit the state as a whole but it's not often people on the east side get considered regardless of how much Spokane actually contributes to the state.

"I haven't listened to the podcast and I usually don't like posts that are self promoting (although at least in this case it is honest), but this is a real problem and one that I deal with pretty regularly, so I will give a little spiel.

Almost all of the hospitals in the area are in a constant state of being filled past capacity.  What does this mean for you? It means if you or your mom/dad ends up sick and go to an ER and need to be admitted, there is a good chance you will be ""boarded"" in the ER, which means that patient is being treated in the ER overnight instead of in a normal hospital bed because there isn't any room.  This is less than ideal for multiple reasons: ER nursing staff with different skills and focus than floor nurses, lack of privacy, noise issues leading to lack of sleep are just some of the examples.  If you aren't boarded you may end up shipped to a different hospital, and you will have to pay the ambulance transport fees.  Furthermore, this different hospital may not even be in the same system (such as UW to Swedish) so your medical history, labs, imaging will all have to be transferred to a new set of providers, increasing the chance of a medical mistake.  Finally, this hospital may not even be in Seattle so it makes transportation home more expensive and harder for family members to visit.

All of this ends up making healthcare more difficult and expensive for everybody.  The hospitals don't profit from it, the doctors and nurses all have to do more work to take care of the transfers and thus have less energy for other tasks.  I suppose the ambulance companies are probably the only ones who benefit from it.  I'm not really sure what the solution is though because in the current state of healthcare, nobody is jumping at the bit to build a new hospital because of all the uncertainty about reimbursement and being able to financially keep it afloat.

"That's not what [the proposed ordinance says](http://columbialegal.org/city-seattle-ordinance-protecting-rights-and-property-homeless-individuals). Basically if it passes you can't move homeless out of a park unless:

* You secure housing for every person in the site at least a month before moving them off (meaning you must have *empty* units ready to go)
* You interview *each* person living there, figure out their situation, and attempt to offer help. If a person accepts an offer you must be able to provide said help
* You provide a minimum of 30 days of notice before moving people
* Phone numbers for outreach organizations dealing with impoundment (which presumably must be staffed and able to answer all calls within a reasonable time)
* You must hand deliver the notice to every tent/structure in a space
* Storage of everyone's stuff collected during the impoundment for *free* in a storage location that is easily accessible by public transit and the disabled with extended operating hours to accommodate them so they don't have to miss work
* Delivery services for people's stuff into housing if they decide to accept it
* Cataloging and photographing of every item collected from the site and entry into a database which is searchable by call center agents working for the city at a staffed item retrieval information center

That's a ridiculous list of requirements, it treats people that are *illegally* camping more like tenants than trespassers. This exponentially increases the amount of work the city (and thus cost) of kicking people out. Even if you were to go through this process you can't issue people trespass orders and telling them that they can be arrested if they return. Instead you must repeat the entire thing from the beginning. People frequently do move back after they are kicked out.

On top of that problem you have the problem that if housing fills up for any reason or storage units for people's stuff then the entire process grinds to a halt and you can't remove anyone.

I'm the most active mod on /r/Seattle.  I'm also the moderator who is willing to interact with the community, answer questions and explain things, which makes me a target.

It's fairly entertaining to see that all mod actions are attributed to me, when other mods frequently are the ones who removed a comment, etc.  I suspect the other mods see how vilified I am and shy away from interacting with the public at all because of it.

That being said, I want /r/Seattle to be a nice place for people to ask questions and interact - I have banned folks who apparently enjoy being horrid to others via the anonymity of the Internet, and one of them created a subreddit to say horrible things about myself and other mods.

"Actually, those intersections you're describing?  They explicitly violate legal standards and have no clear legal progression.  There simply IS NO structure in the law to describe how to act when a trail user encounters a stop and then a crosswalk, while drivers encounter a crosswalk.  I've seen 3 *different* descriptions of usage given by SPD or SDOT of proper behavior, and all of them conflict with written law at some point.   But ALL of them agree on one point: the intent is for road users to give right of way to trail users; the stops are apparently there for the intended purpose of increasing reaction time for drivers.  Meaning, as a driver, you just yield to everyone; them stopping or not doesn't change that.

Don't blame cyclists for infrastructure that can be objectively demonstrated to be idiotic, nonsensical, and cryptic.  Having checked into this pretty extensively, I still have no freaking clue how to behave at those.

Meanwhile, from a cyclist that blows through those stops every damn time and will continue to do so, thank you very much - When I first came here, I would stop and yield to traffic.  99% of cars would stop and wait until I went, delaying everyone involved.  But dammit, I'm a GOOD cyclist, I'm going to follow the damn law!!  So, with determination, I continued to stop every time.

Until one day I did so, just as a car had stopped at the crosswalk.  I waited a bit, and seeing that I wasn't going to continue through, he started to go.  Just as another cyclist moves past me and into the crosswalk.  Cyclist has to make an emergency veer, and car has to make an emergency stop.

Was this the cyclist's fault?  At the time I'd have said hell yes.  In light of the fact that NO ONE in any position of actual expertise on the matter can actually answer what the proper progression for this nonsensical arrangement is, I'm not sure.

But here's what I do know - whether right or wrong, no one knows how to handle those intersections legally - so what the community has settled on is just treating it as a straight up crosswalk.  Stop at those intersections for however long you want, and watch: 99.99% of the users, drivers cyclists and pedestrians alike, treat it as a crosswalk.  

As I discovered that day, maybe I'm not the cause, but if I refuse to take part in that community decision, I put lives at risk.

"I volunteer a lot with Seattle Subway and just registered to clear some things up. 

Seattle Subway is completely volunteer-run, and as an organization we only have a few hundred bucks to our name, and that's mostly used to buy handouts for farmers markets and t shirts for volunteers. 

The timeline graphic this post links to was made by three volunteers for zero money (I was one of them). If you remember the [ST Complete video](https://youtu.be/AVaNjbfaR_I) we made last year, that was just three people, all of which worked for free. I did the motion graphics, and the map was the combined work of two other volunteers. We did pay a small amount to have someone do the voice over because we didn't have proper audio equipment, and that money came from individual small donations. 

We're made up of very passionate people who dedicate their time for the cause of bringing high-capacity transit to the region. We don't *need* anything more than small monetary donations simply because we have passionate people who donate their time and skills, so we rarely need to actually pay for anything but the occasional printing and webhosting fees.

I've had occasions where I will be waiting at a stop for an hour then have 3 buses of the same line all show up simultaneously. I've had busses arrive early. I've had scheduled buses fail to show up entirely and need to wait for the next one. 


This is my experience in-city. If you are going to a hub then out to suburb, I'm not sure if its more or less accurate.

"I used to be a cop in another city (am not PD anymore). 

There was a McDonalds parking lot that people would park in and then go to another site. The lot had clearly marked signs that said no parking except for customers. However, the law states that the car has to be illegally parked in your lot for 45 minutes and that the manager of the establishment has to call to complain. Tow truck drivers know this. This McDonalds pre-signed a stack of the complaint forms and gave it to the tow company. They would then camp out and watch for people to park in the lot, then tow them immediately.

This is illegal. So, a detective set up a sting (I was just a blue-suiter working the take-down car). They parked in the lot and walked out. Sure enough, the tow truck comes up, fills out the paper without any complaint from the McDonalds, hooks up the car and drives off. He was arrested for car theft. 

I wish I'd followed up on the case to find out the adjudication. Tow truck companies are incredibly shady and difficult to monitor. Thanks for looking out for your neighbors, OP. 

EDIT:

This must be on the front page! To address some questions:

* This was not in WA state. The towing laws definitely vary from state to state, and also based on the metro area. So, for those who have had their cars towed without any grace period, you might want to look up your local laws to find out the details. 
* I don't know the specifics of laws for Seattle, WA. I _suspect_ that what the construction worker did (put out the sign without warning and call the police / tow company) was illegal and a violation of some kind of municipal code, but I'm not sure. That doesn't mean he will be cited or arrested, but I sure would if I were dealing with this situation. OP is the real hero.

He's book smart as fuck, but he's always been off socially. He's never been violent though, ever. Never been confrontational to people. He was ""normal"" for high school I guess. Senior year he kinda went off the end. He became super weird and lost a lot of friends.

I kinda feel bad because my class slightly bullied him through out the years. He was hardly ever seen as a ""foreigner"" since most people don't even know he's from Turkey. He was christian all through school and went to youth group with my friends.

Median home price in Vancouver is $1.4 million for example. And many of those homes sit empty and fall apart since their real purpose is for laundering dirty money out of China and not to actually live in. The rest are filled with the children and families of corrupt officials, sketchy business people who are awash in ill-gotten gains, and other sources of dirty money. Virtually none of the wealth escaping China was legitimately earned. The Chinese government is cracking down on corruption which is leading to record levels of capital flight, with US, Australian, and Canadian real estate as some of the easiest ways for the dirty money to get overseas and often comes with the lovely side effect of purchasing residency in the destination country, so not only can they get their dirty illicit money out but they can get their kids and family out of the filthy polluted corrupt dump that is modern China too. It's a win-win for them, and a lose-lose for the destination country (unless you're a real estate broker, then you're loving the whole scam). The entire thing is a massive fraud.

"The simple answer: Because light timing optimization is an NP Hard problem at an obnoxiously enormous scale, which basically means that it is not even computable within our lifetimes using everything we know about computers and every computer on the planet. This means the best we can do is use heuristics, which are kinda like well known rules of thumb, to improve upon the situation. 

The slightly more nuanced answer: Because heuristics which can improve on the situation are hard to prove as improvements because they are hard to measure. Furthermore, most people who think they know how to improve traffic (including traffic engineers, who are loads better at this than laymen) suffer from a multitude of cognitive biases that result in solutions that make *their* commute better, but many other people's commutes worse (sometimes orders of magnitude worse). Light timing proposals almost always fall into this category: Make my lights last longer, time them so I don't hit red lights, and don't worry about everybody else's commute patterns. The simple fact of the matter is that the best known solution we have to light timing is also incredibly unpopular: use one way streets. You see, on a one way street, everybody is moving the same direction, so you can lengthen the contiguous green light patterns so you hit more greens. But if you do that on a two way street, if one direction gets longer chains of green lights, *the traffic moving in the opposite direction gets shorter chains of green lights*. And since red lights mean 0mph for minutes, the tradeoff isn't even remotely fair: in one direction you can save a few minutes, but only by lengthening the opposite direction's commutes by *hours*.  Because Seattle only has a few token one-way streets, we end up with light timing exactly like you describe, where nothing really opens up all at once. 

Another example of a type of ""common sense"" solution to traffic problems is traffic circles. In short, the argument goes like this: You don't have to stop. You go slower through intersections than when you have a green light, but you make up for it by never having red lights. Simple, right? Let's put them everywhere, right? 

That analysis suffers from a huge problem: it ignores higher order effects (where something that happens in one location ends up affecting another location). The downfall of traffic circles is a gridlock situation...when the road is blocked in one direction, it becomes blocked in all directions. This means that a bottleneck somewhere (caused by a congested freeway, a car accident, or possibly a BLM protest) daisy chains its gridlock in all directions, and it does it incredibly quickly. I've seen a handful of traffic simulations of new york city where they replaced all lights with traffic circles, and then simulated a single blocked street at 4pm traffic levels. The simulation I saw had 100% of manhattan at 0mph within 45 minutes, and all of the city within 2 hours. I've been in this situation in Idaho Falls once...a city (town, really) that is nowhere close to being known for traffic. A single car accident locked me and about 1000 other cars in their spots for 90 minutes...even though the accident was on a parallel street in the middle of nowhere. 

This ends up meaning that traffic circles get used as niche solutions in niche locations. They work well in those situations...but as soon as you start chaining them together, you are asking for armageddon.

"To answer OP's question [source: I run an annual charity auction for SHARE]

Tent City 4 had a permit from the City of Bellevue to stay at Temple B'Nai Torah.  When the end of the permit time approached the organization, despite rigorous searching, had no invitations to move to another faith community.  (Municipalities have different regulations about encampments that determine how frequently an encampment can be there.)

At that point the options were to dissolve Tent City4 or move to a piece of unused public property so the people could stay together and safe.  The camp voted to stick together and move to the site at Exit 20, which is owned by King County.  This is Tent City4's fourth visit to that site.  Operations have gone smoothly there on all previous visits. SHARE has contacted the county and offered to apply for a permit for the location.

All participants must abide by a code of conduct in order to live at Tent City4.
There is one entry and exit point, with folks standing security 24/7.  There are porta-potties and a cell phone for emergencies and for employment, medical, or social services contacts.

Several nearby faith organizations provide access to water, bring hot meals, and do other supportive activities.  All campers receive two bus tickets per day, and there is a bus stop a block away.  

All are invited to drop by Tent City4 and talk to the participants and be given a tour of the site.  If they become aware of a problem at the encampment they may contact the SHARE office at 206-448-7889 or emailtc4@sharewheel.org

The One Night Count of the Homeless showed a 21% increase in King County this year.  So far in 2016 42 homeless people have died outside or through violence in King County, where the average age of a homeless person is 48 years old.  Organized encampment provide an inexpensive, safe, immediate shelter for homeless people, saving many lives in the process.",,,,toppler666,,,1474871941,t5_2qhad,t3_54huzs,t3_54huzs,87,1476064852,0,0,d82cqmn,Seattle,87,,

"Aww, it's so cute when people don't understand data.  The study doesn't isolate enough factors to be relevant.  This one, done by the youngest tenured black economist at Harvard does.

http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/fryer/files/main-july_2016.pdf

The study shows that black people were less likely to be shot in those circumstances.  In terms of the overall level of conflict between police and the black community, you have to handicap that with the much higher incidence of crime in the black community and much higher rates of gang membership. Were there racial issues with people of color, then you wouldn't see asians and indians doing exceedingly well. 

Incidentally, the STD rate in the black community is exponentially higher than in the overall community. I guess Gonorhhea and Chlamydia are racist too. 

It's not police that are the issue in the black community.  It's culture.  ",,,,ycgfyn,,,1473387047,t5_2qhad,t3_51t04l,t1_d7f30u9,-17,1475474693,0,0,d7f3r0i,Seattle,-17,,
"Towing someone's car with no notice needs to be much more difficult.  I had my car disappear out of my own apartment complex and thought it was stolen.  Neighbor saw me out looking for it and informed me that the complex just has some deal with the a local tow company that just takes any car they believe shouldn't be parked there even if they should.  Good thing the neighbor knew which company or I would have filed a police report.  Had to get a ride to the tow company, wait for them to open (a couple hours), wait in line with the 20 other people who had their cars taken and then pay the 300 fee.

Towing should not be so easy unless you are literally blocking traffic or something.  You should need a legal document to tow a car that is legally parked in a parking spot for just a few hours.  It is a racket.  Ticketing is one thing but taking a car with no notice is completely different.  Especially since it is done by a random person and not a cop.

"In 2013, a rape threat was posted on a Facebook group to University of Wisconsin undergrad and social activist/blogger Meg Lanker-Simons. The threat stated the writer wanted to hatefuck her for running her liberal mouth. It sparked protests against rape culture on the campus where she spoke out publicly against the writer, and a criminal investigation as well. 

The only problem was, Lanker-Simons wrote the threat against herself. She took a deal that spared her any jail time. http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/3210326

Eight years prior to that, she went by Meghan Michelena. She was fired from a radio station, so naturally she decided to go back and confront her boss with a loaded fucking gun.

"Personally, I think this is a terrible idea. Especially this part:

&gt;The Seattle-Vancouver proposal calls for a decade-long plan to first allow self-driving cars and trucks in carpool lanes and ultimately allow only autonomous vehicles on the highway during peak travel periods. 

The carpool lane is meant to move vehicles carrying a large amount of people, mainly buses and vanpools. Allowing self-driving cars that are likely to have less than those vehicles would compromise the entire purpose of the lane and slow down thousands of commuters who take transit.",,,,SounderBruce,Snohomish County,,1474314024,t5_2qhad,t3_53jdl4,t3_53jdl4,12,1475844732,0,0,d7tkf1b,Seattle,12,,flair
"The SPD are having a long drawn out slowdown strike. It is pretty well known that they are quite unhappy with DOJ oversight and their union contract, and are currently doing everything they can to drag their feet. Their publicly facing party line is that they are understaffed. That might explain things like not responding to Gertrude's complaints about black people walking by her house in under an hour, but it doesn't explain things like this. This is deliberate non-enforcement...the same non-enforcement that Danny Westneat found when he handed a property crime case to the SPD on a silver platter. If you remember, they refused to address that one too, and they continued to refuse until it became a PR problem that O'Toole had to respond to. 

My suggestion for you: Make this a PR problem too. 

My suggestion for Seattle: Let's put together a ballot initiative to ban police unionization. And if that doesn't work, fire the entire police department and start over from scratch. It's not like we're gonna miss out on all of the non-enforcement they're doing in the transition period.

"It's certainly a systemic problem and the officers know that and it's their immediate scapegoat for not doing their jobs. What they (and all public servants) should keep in mind is that it's our tax money paying their salary and they are the employees of the people. My interactions with the boots-on-the-ground officers has never been pleasant, productive or resulted in any outcome that I would describe as in keeping with their motto ""serve and protect"". They are bullies when you try to be nice and useless when called upon. If you're saying it's a higher level issue than the way the officers conduct themselves and report small crimes then you're not wrong, but you are missing the point: The police do not care and they are not doing what they are paid to do. I think it's unwise to become complacent when dealing with these issues. There shouldn't be the expectation that a stolen bike isn't worth the time to find it. That means that the criminals have more power than the police and it leaves a dangerously wide gap around what is and is not going to be enforced. I had a bike stolen, OP had a break-in/assault. If OP didn't have the skills to defend himself, our was someone's daughter, this could have been a much more serious situation.

"I'll point directly to the [platform published on his website](https://www.johnsonweld.com/issues). Sources don't get much more primary than that.

&gt; Governor Johnson believes the Environmental Protection Agency, when focused on its true mission, plays an important role in keeping the environment and citizens safe. ... Johnson does not, however, believe the government should be engaging in social and economic engineering for the purpose of creating winners and losers in what should be a robust free market.  Preventing a polluter from harming our water or air is one thing. Having politicians in Washington, D.C., acting on behalf of high powered lobbyists, determine the future of clean energy innovation is another. ... Is the climate changing? Probably so. ... Is man contributing to that change? Probably so.

It seems that Johnson feels that the scope of work of the EPA should be reduced from its already low power, and he is not considering environmental and climate change problems to be the existential threat that they are, instead wishing to hide behind bullshit principles of ""free market"" determining whether or not we incinerate ourselves in the next 80 years.

On Education:

&gt; Decisions that affect our children should be made closer to home, not by bureaucrats and politicians in Washington, D.C. That is why he believes we should eliminate the federal Department of Education.

More insanity. What would this accomplish? Allowing state governments to continue to throttle public school budgets and dictate public education curriculum in another incarnation of the intelligent design-covered pushing of religious beliefs onto students?

In response to a consumption tax replacing the capital gains tax, income tax, business taxes, this is literally one of the single worst economic policies outside of the Donald Trump campaign. What's a great way to accelerate growing inequality and keep the ultra-wealthy (who have an extremely low ratio of consumption/(earnings+wealth+capital))? Stop the only effective measure to redistribution we have.

Gary Johnson is a fucking nut who has ***very*** few good ideas for how to run the wealthiest, most advanced, and one of the most unequal societies in human history. If his ideas to abolish the IRS &amp; Department of Education, and his plans to sort the EPA from ""meddling in the free market"" sound like sane ideas to you, I'm sorry that you feel that way.

"It's a hot mess for many dual income professionals as well.  I'm sure the worlds tiniest violin brigade will be out for my daring to imply ""those people"" are suffering too, but it's true.

The best off people I've met are the either the late 20 something couples that have almost no obligations and can still save, save, save, or people who have had a ""liquidity event"" such as 7 years at amazon with a bunch of nice stock awards they never cashed in.

Others couples, while they may have the high paying jobs, often have factors that cut into their ability to go after housing.  Kids are usually the biggest influence.  Besides the obvious expenses, they can't get by with a 1 or 2 bedroom apartment any more, so more outlay for rental housing right now means less savings for a house purchase.   A previous divorce is usually a financial Neutron bomb.  A big medical event, or having to assist aging parents is another not unheard of things to divert significant money away from the house purchase fund.  Been through a bankruptcy in the last downturn?  Ooops, no cheap mortgage for you. 

And some couples who could purchase a home they desire if they stretched themselves... are saying ""no thanks, I'll pass"" because of the uncertainty of their incomes over the long term vs a big mortgage payment for 30 years.    Someone who is 50 and finally making 150K+ and has a 45 year old spouse making 90k, can say ""I'm qualified for this big mortgage... but is the bank really assuming I'll be working full time at 80 and my wife at 75??..."".   Tech sector jobs are notoriously short in duration.  The median employee tenure at Amazon is what? 1.9 years?  Good money right now, but seeing that you would have to *sustain* that income level for decades in this working market, makes it sometimes feel like a trap.     A younger couple in the same income situation might be wondering about someone staying home when kids come along, and deciding they can only base their long term commitments on one income, no matter how much money the banker tells them they are qualified for.

Finally, if you haven't experienced it before, you might be surprised to see how much more in taxes is paid on that second income.  Our progressive system is designed that way.  Pass about $150k in AGI and not only do rates go up, but you get the marriage penalty and deduction phase outs.   No one income point is a fiscal cliff, but the govt take gets ratcheted up on each additional dollar.

I guess my point is: Don't think all dual-income professional couples have it laid out for them to buy a house in Seattle.  The price of entry has gone up so much that the target group of people who can do it is more nuanced than that simple brush stroke of categorization.

"Seattle was a different city back then. Belltown was basically deserted at night except for the homeless and people making their way between the Nitelite, The Crocodile, the Frontier Room, The Vogue, etc... I lived in one of those yellow houses right on Western circa 1990 and there were times I could walk all the way to the Nitelite without seeing a single soul. Pioneer Square was basically the same, with the exception of the crowds from Bellevue during the joint cover nights. 

The one thing both of those areas had going on back then though was the music. There was *always* a show going on... and usually 3 or 4 on the same night that you really wanted to go to. Many nights would be something like: get prefunc drinks at The Frontier Room, head over to the Vogue to score some coke/other illicit substance, make a quick stop-off at the Crocodile for the opening set, hit the Nitelite for a couple  quick rounds on the way to the Colourbox to catch your high school friends play, head down to the OK Hotel to see whichever band was headlining that night, and then nightcap at The Central. Many people were on this sort of circuit *every single night*. There was also the at least weekly venture to Rckcndy and the Offramp... and the joy of peeing in the parking lot behind the Offramp because their bathroom was fucking disgusting... always. 

Almost every decent show had a fair share of Seattle rock royalty in attendance. Mark Arm basically lived at The Crocodile. The Pearl Jam guys were basically everywhere at once when they weren't on tour. Layne Staley was super fond of getting down and dancing his ass off at Re-bar, pre heavy heroin use, of course. Kim Thayil seemed to magically appear at any even slightly heavy show. At metal shows you may see any of the above plus maybe an appearance by Geoff Tate or Scott Rockenfield. If you were a celebrity seeker back then you would have been in heaven.

Except for one thing: Seattle does not believe in rockstars. People who are world-famous are treated like everyday normal people here. I don't think I have every seen an autograph happening here, with the possible exception of a record store appearance at Easy Street or Cellphone Square... and even then it seemed super awkward. Seattle is one of the very few places in the world where you can walk up to someone you really admire and tell them that. What will result will most likely be a handshake and a heart-felt ""Thanks, man. That means a lot!""

"The thing is that there are foreign buyers from every country in Seattle. I personally know a British guy who bought an investment condo and Indians who bought houses for each family member. 

Most of them don't live here full time. Don't even get me started on the Canadian and Mexican buyers. I don't see anyone getting their pitchforks out for them.

Chinese nationals aren't the biggest buyers, but they seem to be getting the majority of the blame. It could be political or racism or both. 

I was born and raised in Seattle, am part Chinook, and moved back to work at a tech company. Ya'll should be more worried about those with H1B visas (far more of them) snapping up houses instead of Chinese people, who serve as a convenient scapegoat for corporate greed.

"This graph from Australian Institute of Criminology shows that I am right: http://www.aic.gov.au/statistics/homicide.html

Observe that in the immediate aftermath the gun deaths have fallen by a factor of two, whereas overall homicide rates did not budge. This is a good data set because gun confiscation was very quick, and so lead to immediate aftermath that can be examined.

The two decade following it saw dramatic reduction of homicides across the western world (which people now attribute to reduction of lead use in gasoline), and in US the homicide rate fell faster than in Australia.

Same thing for suicides.

&gt;Police finally tracked him down on Wednesday at his Crown Hill-area home. Cops detained him and he led them to a residence in Shoreline, where he had stashed the red Bronco after the Northgate Mall incident. He gave written consent to search the vehicle, which contained a stash of tools, according to court records. He also admitted that he stashed a number of stolen tools at that residence and had tossed a BB gun into a nearby trash can.

"The TL;DR on this thread claims the article says police did a good job. I disagree with that summary. Here's an alternate TL;DR. I've tried to not inject any personal opinion, and I'm certainly not trying to defend prostitution. (The article does imply that prostitution should be legal but stops short of saying so.) 

Group of johns runs some online forums for prostitutes and johns. A few of them--and a few prostitutes--rent out space in Bellevue downtown apartments for prostitution. Both prostitutes and johns find this arrangement beneficial. The benefit to the prostitutes is that they can verify that the johns are safe and clean.

Police (Bellevue, Seattle, King County) bust up the operation. Local media portrays it as human trafficking. But it's clearly not what we all think about when we hear ""human trafficking"". No one is captive. No one is exploited (by someone else.) No one was a sex slave. 

In the end, the prosecution yields a couple of very light sentences--mostly community service and taking classes about how prostitution is bad. Lots and lots of taxpayer money is wasted by prosecuting ""safe"" prostitution instead of trying to stop ""unsafe"" prostitution. Money that the federal government allocated to stop human trafficking is being spent keeping women who choose sex work from being able to do it safely. 

I highly recommend reading the [""other discussions""](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/duplicates/51zwgn/the_truth_about_the_biggest_us_sex_trafficking/) on this article if you're interested, especially the discussions in /r/SexWorkers and /r/law.

Edit: I will always take the downvotes for comments like this. Other first world countries don't have the gun violence problems that we have and I'm all for freedom but at a certain point we need to realize just how dangerous these things are. Sure OP is probably a stable person who would only ever use their weapon in self defense, but there are millions of people who are not like that and it is demonstrated every day. The mother of one of my friends was killed in cold blood by the cafe racer shooter. And I bet most of you in the comments have been affected by a mass shooting as well. And yet there's still all these people talking about freedom. Freedom is great but when certain people abuse that freedom they ruin it for everyone else.

"#Single occupant vehicles in the HOV lane
  
Seriously, it defeats the entire purpose of the HOV lane if vehicles with only one person in em can freely use it.  I have a *very* easy commute, CC to Tukwila, that only requires me to drive on I-5 for ~15 minutes, but every day I see at least 2-3 cars with 1 occupant driving along in the HOV lane.
  
And that doesn't even begin to cover the abuse of the HOV on ramps!!  
  
Just for giggles, friend /u/wsdot, set up a camera at the on-ramp to NB I-5 at S Columbia Way (where the road splits into on-ramps for NB, SB, and the West Seattle Bridge), and see how many people use the HOV on-ramp with only one person in the car.  I reckon you'll hit 100+ in under an hour.

From the article:

Of the 10 markets with the largest 30-year change in home value, nine are in the West. San Francisco tops the list with rate of return of 557.6%. San Jose grabs second place with an increase of 496.5%, and the third Bay Area metro – Oakland – places sixth with a gain of 383%. Three others are also in California (Orange County, Los Angeles, and San Diego). Outside of the Golden State, the Pacific Northwest makes a strong showing. Seattle and Portland take the fourth and fifth spot with returns of 404.2% and 395.7%, respectively. The only non-Western metro to make the list was Miami with an increase of 299.7%.

"I used to drive like a jackass in my late teens and early 20s. Speeding, tailgating, making multiple lane changes to go around slow-moving vehicles in the left lane(s). I saw bad accidents but I thought they'd never happen to me. A few years ago, I stopped driving as often and starting riding my bicycle around town because sitting in traffic and trying to find expensive parking became increasingly frustrating/stressful. I got into longer distance rides and touring. I've been utterly terrified by drivers on suburban &amp; rural roadways screaming past me with little clearance on a two-lane road with little to no shoulder. I've had trucks ""roll coal"" while passing me. I've been honked at and heckled - all because I choose a different form of transportation.

It really woke me up. Not only do I view driving as the true privilege it is, I view it as somewhat of a luxury. I drive slow enough to enjoy it. I keep right except to pass. I find speeding incredibly stressful. I'm mindful to minimize distractions because I know that my multi-ton steel cage equipped with plenty of technology to save my life if I collide with another vehicle or stationary object is fully capable of ruining the lives of other users on our roadways.

"Bro, Autonomous cars aren't gonna solve our transportation problem. They will provide fractional benefit on city streets because we still need stoplights for peds and cyclists, etc. They won't bring that many more people on the freeways because they will need safety space between cars in case a tire blows or the engine fails or some shit, and people already drive too damn close together for any reasonable assumption of safety on the highways when its busy, so, I just don't see autonomous cars making a dent in traffic. The railway is literally like a 5 lane freeway in each direction in capacity increase. That's what we're building. We're building an extremely low profile, extremely reliable 5 lane each direction freeway to move a shitload of people around town. You can't match that with cars no matter who the driver is.

-Initially Removed Towing Fees. 

Perhaps after Reddit prompting? - Called Towing company and removed towing fees. As far as I know, no indication on how this was resolved? Did they pay them? Or just order the towing company to release the cars despite their time and labor? (I don't care too much about this, but it is sort of interesting)

&gt;He's book smart as fuck, but he's always been off socially. He's never been violent though, ever. Never been confrontational to people. He was ""normal"" for high school I guess. Senior year he kinda went off the end. He became super weird and lost a lot of friends.

&gt;I kinda feel bad because my class slightly bullied him through out the years. He was hardly ever seen as a ""foreigner"" since most people don't even know he's from Turkey. He was christian all through school and went to youth group with my friends. 

&gt;Before this he was the weird/funny chubby kid who wore an Ushanka to school. It's gonna suck to hear his name in the same sentence as killer.

My grandfather thought that must have been some really good fish, but wasn't interested and went back to his paper. 
One of the warheads had armed on the torpedoes. When this happened, you had to rush the torpedo to a tube and fire it out before it blows up in your ship. Grandpa had no idea how serious the situation was on the ship.
Later on in his career, the Scorpion, a fellow nuclear sub, was lost mysteriously at sea. My grandfather bets it was probably a torpedo that armed and detonated before they could fire it.

I believe many of our social services are underfunded to the point that they incur higher costs in the long term. 

Cutting Medicaid, Medicare, and Food stamps to fund a UBI would save money in the short term, but cost money in the long term as people get even more into poverty and are completely unable to subsist without government assistance. 

In general, our problem with government assistance is that we don't want to give enough aid to make people independent. Instead, we give a trickle of aid until people are shaky but mostly self-sufficient. Then we pull the aid, which usually results in them relapsing and needing the highest kind of aid again. 

Nowhere is this more evident than in healthcare, where we give people limitless amounts of expensive emergency care, but refuse to give them inexpensive preventative care. ",,,,Ansible32,,,1472920983,t5_2qhad,t3_50ynw1,t1_d7845x2,13,1475301248,0,0,d784kwf,Seattle,13,,

"Personally, my reason for joining the [REDACTED] subreddit while distancing myself from this one was that the rules here just appear so damn arbitrary and the moderation approach is not transparent in the slightest.

When I asked you a few days ago about why sports content is routinely removed from this sub, you responded:

&gt;Look at it this way; if the news story about the Seahawks or the Mariners would appear in a newspaper in the ""News"" section, we'll permit the post. Otherwise, it's something that belongs in the sports section, and therefore would be better served by being put into /r/Mariners or /r/Seahawks. Make sense?

Ok, fine.  I disagree STRONGLY*, but fine...  Where in the hell is this codified in the rules?  I didn't know this until you said that a few days ago, and I'm willing to bet that most people here don't know that stories about Seattle sports teams are NOT considered Seattle related.

My chief complaint about the moderation of this subreddit is that the rules are arcane and obscured so that the subscribers really don't know why their posts have been removed. When posts about Seattle sports teams, articles on Amazon, documentaries about Amanda Knox, secure scheduling in Seattle, etc. are all removed for not being 'Seattle Related' by the modteam, how are we the users supposed to know what all is actually Seattle related?

I really have no interest in involving myself with drama, but I'd highly recommend either loosening up what constitutes a 'Seattle Related' post and letting the voting system take care of it, or at least codifying what exactly is allowed and not allowed in the subreddit's rules.

I don't what the [REDACTED] subreddit to be necessary, but as long as the moderation here continues to work the way it does, I see no reason to thing that the other subreddit won't eventually overtake this one. 

*I disagree because this leads to the fragmentation of the community.  I'm not subscribed to /r/Mariners or /r/Seahawks, and I have no interest in doing so.

"You need only look at Vancouver, BC and Toronto, Ontario for evidence of what will happen. Do you fancy an average detached house price of $1.5 million or neighbourhoods that are bought up, torn down(and replaced with hideous architecture) and left empty?

&gt; These kind of articles strike me as xenophobic scapegoating. Seattle's housing is expensive for the same reason every &gt; geographically-constrained american city's housing is expensive: overly-restricted supply in the face of rising demand.

The same race carding and bullshit PC arguments(citing lack of evidence) were used for years to silence critics up in here in Canada. There now exists, possibly one of the worst housing security and economic challenges to be faced by an entire generation.

&gt;Even if there were a large number of foreigners attempting to park wealth in unoccupied Seattle real estate, how is &gt;that a bad thing? We get extra property tax revenue with no additional use of services like transportation and schools, 

Bullshit. It's a much larger drain on the local economy than you might think. It leads to urban density disparities as houses are bought up and left empty - locals are forced to choose more affordable neighbourhoods(or leave the city altogether). Local businesses languish as the neighbourhoods are slowly hollowed out(look at Dunbar and Point Grey in Vancouver) and schools are shutdown because families leave.

&gt; and all we have to do is allow taller buildings to be built? Sign me up.

Vancouver's skyline is a forest of hundreds of 30+ story condo towers - 30% are left unoccupied....

I can also attest to the helpfulness of the happy lamp/SAD lamp and especially the power of exercise. You might be tempted to drink in social situations, but it tends to worsen my social anxiety and definitely depression. 

Exercise is more powerful than antidepressants: even a brief walk helps. I'm with everyone on the importance of keeping a schedule.
