"&gt; People were constantly wanting to work at my store for 9 an hour/ no one is trying to ""make a living"" from part time retail job, just a fun place to work.

Reality check for you: most people I know who work(ed) part time jobs fall into one of the following:

* Still in High School, trying/learning to become independent enough to move out on their own.
* Student, and trying to supplement loans/grants/other funds to stay alive and in school.
* Young adult fresh out of school trying to get started on their own, but unable to get a full time spot because there are none or because they're not experienced enough.
* Adult of any age working multiple part time jobs because all the full time jobs were taken by overqualified people who lost their real career jobs when the economy shit the bed.

Dunno what world you live in where a part time job is not something you do to make a living, but it sounds like a damn fantasy to me.

"I think the key point in /u/GrinningPariah is:

&gt; and the reasons for that are complex and cyclical

It seems, in the reading I've done on this, many people with (admittedly personal as opposed to scientific) experience tend to agree that gender roles and stereotypes (girls play with dolls, boys play with legos), mixed with a boys club vibe (inadvertently imho) in many STEM classes/careers, keeps young girls away which in turn keeps women away which perpetuates the cycle.  I'm annoyed that I'm going to have to say this, but I'm not some SJW and I'm not trying to white knight here.  As a programmer myself, I am interested in why the gender gap in participation is there and I don't think it can be completely or even substantially attributed to some intrinsic difference between men and women.  I've not studied this so obviously all of the above is second hand knowledge.

Apologies if this came off as combative or I misinterpreted your comment.  This is something I've been thinking a lot about lately and obviously have some strong opinions on.

"Post this in ~~r/legaladvise~~ r/legaladvice as well, they are well versed in tenancy laws, and can potentially have some insights for you.

(I am not a lawyer) I suspect that the best scenario you could hope for is a negotiation with LL of a payment plan (if not with the LL himself, since he seems ticked at you, then by a court ruling?).  I don't think the violation of the municipal code will absolve you of the payment due.  

There is that section that states the bill to the tenants may not exceed the amount of the bill received by the utility company; but I'd assume anyone adjudicating this would allow for the collective year's worth of bills from utility company to be valid for his claim to charging you $1000 (or whatever the bills were).  You may be able to request a copy of the building's actual utility bill from LL (I don't know whether you have a right to that) and at least verify that the large amount is accurate.  $1000 for 6 months seems a tad high from my experience (in studio/1BDRs), but probably in the ballpark for a larger/higher-usage home.

"A long time ago the head of security of an international airport in the middle east wrote and article that basically laughed the TSA out of the room. The means by which the TSA ""protects"" citizens is so ineffective and dangerous on so many levels. From the fact that they have a HUGE number of people grouped together so if something exploded and people had to be evacuated it would be absolute pandemonium, that they have no in-house bomb detonating chambers for suspicious packages and therefore a bomb squad has to be called in, that staff is woefully small and untrained, and people getting trampled to death as well as a high body count if an explosion happened within the cluster to the fact that NO security checks happen pre-line which basically allows someone to carry a bomb in a bag to the TSA line no problem.

"West Seattle is on Puget Sound, as opposed to the Pacific Ocean and the actual coast, but the warmth of the Japan Current makes our weather milder for the latitude. The weather generally comes in from the SW. It will be windier on the beach, but the weather in Seattle in general is much milder than Minnesota. What will surprise you is that 2""-3"" of snow will bring things to a standstill with epic 8-hour traffic jams--- but snow is rare in the city. A typical winter day is 40f-45f, sporadic drizzle and dark. It's damp, with high cold humidity. It rarely gets below freezing and almost never in the teens. We get a couple cold spells each winter that would make a Minnesotan shrug. We get a big wind storm one in a while. A warm summer day is 80f and we get some heat spells, but nothing to compare to the sauna in the Midwest. Weather in the 90's is rare and I've seen 100f+ only a few times in my lifetime here. Eastern Washington, on the other side of the Cascades is a whole other thing, with colder winters and hot dry summers. 

Living on the beach near Alki Point in West Seattle can have beautiful views, but the summer weekend traffic is terrible. South of Alki Beach is all residential and totally different. The business districts on California Avenue in West Seattle are like small towns. Getting to downtown with a car can be a hassle sometimes. Buses are good and there is a walk-on water taxi too. 

As mentioned, Seattle is in a region of micro-climates. Opt for a south facing sunny exposure if you can. Seattle is known for rain, but it is rarely a deluge like Midwest thunderstorms. It drizzles for days on end and the significant thing is that it is overcast over 200 days a year.

"Point of order!  Yes to many, but not all in the 46th district.
  
Assuming the worst, I made sure to be there on time and had 4 people in front of me in my line when I got there at 11:35.  Many lines were 30+ deep already at that point.  

Crazy, shouting Sanders supporters: check.  During the 5 minute ""change your vote to clinton"" speech, we had one guy yell angrily ""FASCIST!"" when the speaker said that ""if you don't vote, you don't matter""  Questionable choice of words, sure, but maybe overkill.  

Rule 2.  Holy hell, what was that about?  
If you weren't there, basically, alternates will now be called from other districts if your district needs one which is a change from the previous rule that stated that if your people weren't there, you lost your delegate.  
They appeared to have changed this rule with a handout at the front door, which upset a lot of people.  
They changed it ostensibly to reach parity with the state level rules, but oddly timed (this morning, one speaker claimed) when you consider that the rule change will specifically address and prevent the very thing that has been happening to Clinton where none of her delegates show up and she loses as a result (3 or 4 states now) despite the rules being this way for many election cycles.  
I can see both sides. The caucus is a shitshow and is very inaccessible to many people (I was there for about 6 hours today) so softening the rules to make it less punishing for those who slip makes sense.  We can't really complain that the caucus process is making it harder to vote and then argue when they try to ease some of it's restrictive nature.  
There were many speakers arguing, some legitimately, most not. One speaker asked ""point of order!"" that we adjourn for the day and come back tomorrow so she could go walk her dog.   
The best part - after 2 hours of going back and forth about it, demanding counts before the rule change went into effect (aye, approved,) then voting to close the discussion about the count (aye, approved,) then voting on the rule (aye, approved,) then realizing we never got the count before approving the rule... At this point, the guy in charge of the rules gets up for the first time and basically says ""yeah, you guys have no say in this. If you don't approve the rules, *no* delegates move forward.""   

Through all this, and all the grumblings about walking dogs and sick spouses, and the extra time taken to debate this thing we had no control over, there were enough delegates and alternates and it didn't matter.  
Meanwhile, the person doing the math didn't do it right, (angry shouts from the audience let her know) and would have needed all the time we gave her anyhow.",,,,hectorinwa,,,1460950603,t5_2qhad,t3_4f9z1i,t3_4f9z1i,45,1463515425,0,0,d274dpw,Seattle,45,,

"This year does seem worse than usual, but it varies by type of pollen.

We are hip deep in tree pollen right now, which is what's causing some peoples' problems.  Grass pollen is probably pretty high too, but not really a thing if you live in the center of the city or near the water - except for days where the wind blows from the east, and picks up grass pollen from the hills east of here.

This region is still nothing like the midwest, south or Texas for grass pollen though.  We're an order of magnitude less, look up the pollen counts in PPM.


We do very well for grass and tree throughout the year other than right now.  

We usually do pretty well for smog/carbon-based particulates.  The prevailing wind off the pacific helps keep grass pollen and car smoke pollen down to very low levels compared to most of the country.

"Having worked at a garbage company when this rule was implemented, pretty much 100% of the people here have absolutely misunderstood the ordinance. 

There are already rules in the city that allow collectors to visually inspect trash for substances that would be hazardous.

I know it's hard, having a small can to dump your leftovers in, but it's a small price to pay for reducing the overall city garbage output.


It's not city inspectors going around - the city has about 8 ""inspectors"", and their primary purpose is to ensure that the collectors are properly billing residents for any extra pickups or can size changes.  It's the collectors themselves, who will flip a can lid, look in, and if they don't see anything obvious, they dump the can.  As for the the attention to detail, well, when you have a route that requires tipping 800 cans a day, you are not going to spend a lot of time on each can to see what's in there.  plainly obvious cans are going to get tagged, and that's about it.

Of course, these same folks managed to overlook the fact that the border patrol officials who let the asshats in through customs and immigration from Canada were public employees.  Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain....the problem is privatization, people!  And so TSA was born.

Anyhoo...now we're where we are.  If there's one thing you can say about American democracy, it's this: we get the government we deserve.

The anti-privatization harpies weren't entirely to blame.  Department of Homeland Security...the most bloated agency in the history of the US....came into existence because other voices droned on about the lack of different agencies being 'unable to cooperate.'  As if somehow INS knew that hijackers were on their way to comandeer airplanes, and just didn't tell the FAA because they didn't report to the same secretary umpteen levels up.

Good gods, people can be so stupid.  If there's a takeaway, it's this.  Sometimes fucked up shit just happens.  At least once, it's going to be the most fucked up shit that will happen to you in your entire life.

I think this is one of the most powerful points in the article.  Either way, it's well worth a read.  This is, indeed, a major issue and one that should concern any parent in my view, but most especially anyone who wishes to instill in our children a baseline of tolerance.

Schools are an inherently artificial place to begin with, socially.  At no time in our adult life are we so surrounded by others of our same age and background as we are in school.  Is it any wonder that our youth are unable to relate to others as well as they should?  Is it any wonder that we're seeing an increase in bullying at some of our schools, rather than a decrease as we would hope?  Is it any wonder that we have a problem of youth respecting appropriate authority?  Of course it isn't!  We're showing our children by our actions that it is acceptable to say one thing and do another!

This must change and it must change as soon as it can possibly be made to do so.  ",,,,JustNilt,Greenwood,,1460592355,t5_2qhad,t3_4eofbj,t3_4eofbj,13,1463425757,0,0,d21wiz1,Seattle,13,,flair greenwood

"That's even less realistic than electoral reform.  FPTP always results in two party rule because to vote for a third party guarantees victory to the worst.  Suppose you have a super lefty from one party and a super righty from the other.  You lean right, but the super righty is too extreme for you, and the super lefty is even worse.  So you say screw it and vote for a centrist.  Your vote gets ""taken"" from super righty, guaranteeing the win for the even worse super lefty.

If candidates race to the center, they lose in primaries to more extreme candidates (especially among the repubs).  The point is, you can't abandon your party without guaranteeing victory to the opposite party, so most people don't do it.

A better solution is a system that doesn't necessitate tactical voting - where voting for who you like most doesn't guarantee a win for who you like least.  Where you vote FOR someone, instead of AGAINST their opponent.  Preference voting/single transferable vote/instant runoff voting.  It's good stuff.",,,,juiceboxzero,Bothell,,1460993782,t5_2qhad,t3_4f9z1i,t1_d27fhvz,25,1463523742,0,0,d27ltlm,Seattle,25,,flair

"Have you tried [*Psychology Today's* Find a Therapist](https://therapists.psychologytoday.com/rms/) site?  It's the best resource I've found.  I know therapists who recommend it.  You can filter for all kinds of things--type of practitioner, specialties, treatment orientation, location, insurance they take, etc. etc.  Therapists pay a fee to be listed, which means that everybody involved has incentive to keep the information current and accurate.

Insurance companies' websites seem to be the WORST place to look, in my experience.  I've used two different ones, and they gave me nothing but therapists who weren't taking new patients, or didn't take that insurance anymore, or were no longer at that number or location.  I called at least thirty different ones before I found one who might work.

If I was being extra-cynical, I would have to think that they're making it as hard as possible for you to find a therapist in hopes you'll give up and quit looking and not make the insurance company shell out money for your treatment.  But if the explanation isn't quite that deliberate and calculating and evil, it's at least clear that keeping those lists and websites current is a very, very low priority for insurance companies.",,,,casagordita,SeaTac,,1460097438,t5_2qhad,t3_4duvsj,t3_4duvsj,11,1463300777,0,0,d1un012,Seattle,11,,flair

If Pronto went bankrupt, the City would have gotten it for free.  Or if Pronto went bankrupt, the City would have been able to buy it for pennies on the dollar.  One or the other.  Instead, Kubly gave Pronto $350,000 in unauthorized funds to keep it going long enough to give the City Council fake membership numbers to get an additional $1.5Million with $5 million to come later.  Kubly gave Pronto investors their money back for a bad investment decision.  Perhaps, Kubly was also an investor and so in effect, he paid himself from City funds--taxpayer money.  



This is not a matter of a $5,000 fine for ethics code violations.  This is fraud and probably plenty of other crimes and should be prosecuted as such.  Minimizing it as an ethics code violation is not right.  Obviously, City government is trying to distract from the larger issues involved.  The City is not doing its job here.

"&gt; managing their emotions healthfully

There it is, thank you.

The lack of education (e.g. upbringing) with regard to emotions and communication is the singular greatest cause of societal unrest. 

The more you delve into NVC and what it means to be an emotionally intelligent person, you'll begin to understand that most conflict and harm can be avoided on our little planet. 

Personal outbursts, unneeded drama, and yes, resorting to express your emotions violently even to the point of murder.

"As a supply-sider, in my opinion they're still doing a crappy job.

1. They *still* aren't building fast enough. Amazon alone is hiring multiple thousands of software engineers each year. Include their other roles and that alone is estimated to exceed the buildings going up near downtown (afaik that's where most capacity is going). Amazon is not the only software company growing aggressively, and software is not the only high-pay industry.
2. They're focusing on luxury apartments. Many moving into the city are used to living cheap/small. Those people don't want luxury apartments regardless of their income... I remember living nicely on $700/m as a student, fuck paying more than twice that just for rent. That's why we see vacant buildings, they built the wrong apartments.
3. They're building in the wrong areas. SLU and downtown have the most units going up but UW/cap hill/ballard are in high demand (especially young tech workers). Capitol Hill would have 10+ story apartments near the lightrail station if we were truly supply-side.

"Lol, I'll just keep reposting [my comment about why Park and Rides are terrible policy](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/42v2kk/is_there_a_park_and_ride_near_the_new_udistrict/czdi21u). What I find even more funny is that I was using a $40,000/stall figure from the construction of the Angle Lake P&amp;R. It's great to hear that ST has doubled that to EIGHTY FUCKING THOUSAND DOLLARS PER GODDAMN SPOT.

&gt;A single parking spot at a structured P&amp;amp;R costs approx $40,000 in public funds to build.

&gt;But that's just the beginning. That number excludes land acquisition costs, operations and maintenance costs, opportunity costs, secondary infrastructure costs needed for increased traffic to the P&amp;amp;R, tertiary infrastructure costs due to incentivizing third-ring suburbs to sprawl even further out (by their very nature, third-ring suburbs have a very high infrastructure cost compared to the property tax revenue collected), environmental costs, health care costs, lost tax revenue costs, etc, etc.

&gt;And all of that is for a single 'free' to use spot that serves a transit ridership of around two or so people per day. That is a staggeringly poor cost to benefit ratio.

&gt;High-capacity transit works best when you have residents/businesses developed in a compact pattern surrounding it so that you can walk/bike to the HCT. This is scalable, creates an actual place and destination that encourages all-day/all-week two-way ridership patterns, and is revenue-generating. P&amp;amp;Rs create a fixed ceiling for ridership, are completely dead spaces that serve primarily as no more than a place you travel through versus to, are focused primarily on peak commuter service, and are a revenue sink.

&gt;For a quick visual, I took Tukwila Int Blvd Station and draw the standard approx 10-minute walkshed around it. I then picked a random city in Japan (ended up at Nagano) and zoomed in on a [small suburb](https://www.google.com/maps/@36.7112099,138.2759713,2708m/data=!3m1!1e3) outside of the main city. I picked Japan because they have great access to transit most anywhere you go.

&gt;[Look at the walkshed of the same land area](https://i.imgur.com/1hbh6qi.jpg) around both stations. From TIBS the only place you can walk to is to your car. There's absofuckinglylutely nowhere there worth walking to (OK, there's a McD's across a sea of parking and a six-lane road as well as a few hard-to-walk-to apartments). Now look at Random Suburban Station outside of Random Japanese City. In the exact same distance there're a shitton of places to go to. Tons of houses. Parks. Schools. Post Offices. Shrines. A hospital. Restaurants. Shops. Farms(!). And it's all low-rise development.

&gt;One of these suburbs built a resilient all-day any-day people-focused community, and the other one built expansive and expensive shrines to cars.

&gt;That is why I hold such disdain for park and rides.",,,,shoeson,,,1461175657,t5_2qhad,t3_4fo9k6,t3_4fo9k6,25,1463575484,0,0,d2am8vw,Seattle,25,,

"I work for a restaurant that has moved over to the service charge. The pos system that we use generate sales reports that clearly delineate how much money in service charges were paid that day. Since I can also track how much in total sales I made, it is fairly simple to figure out the percentage of sales that I was responsible for, thereby giving me an exact amount that I had earned the shift. So far, based on the math it shows that exactly zero percent of the service charge has gone to the house. On top of that, since it was ruled that tip sharing for boh employees is illegal, now the waitstaff and support staff all retain a higher percentage of that service charge. My restaurant also made a guarantee that they would ""make us whole"" if we end up making less money than we were making before the service charge switch, meaning that  if we were averaging above 20% before the service charge, the restaurant will cover the difference. 
 In my eyes, the service charge change over will be a great turning point for us in the foh. The reason our restaurant has adopted the ""make you whole"" policy is out of fear of losing quality employees, thereby putting some of the power back into our hands and leveling the power balance between the owners and the staff by a little bit.

I just got back from Vancouver BC where there are sushi restaurants every 50 meters, and [every pub and restaurant serves something called a ""dynamite roll""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamite_roll) in addition to pad thai and indian curry.

People end up with very specific different categories in seattle.

Seattle has one big contender for very authentic high end sushi. Shiro's in belltown - the namesake of the restaurant trained under Jiro Ono one of the world's best chefs. People will talk about other restaurants who have been around or have a deserved quality reps, but Shiro's is your coke vs pepsi argument.

The other place that comes up a lot is technically a fusion place, but they focus on *sustainable* catch and own the website sushiwhore.com. Mashiko in west seattle has some amazing unique rolls, and a owner chef with character.

Nearly everything else falls into bang for your buck, or man I love the menu/chef at this place categories.

There are innumerable reasons that a bus could be late:  there could have been an accident causing traffic, the bus route could be a very long route that is susceptible to getting behind, disruptive/intoxicated passengers, a first aid emergency, handicapped people having trouble getting on and off the bus, shortage of drivers, people having trouble getting bikes on and off the bike racks.

Once, I was on a bus and someone accidentally sat on a needle.  Am I mad that the bus driver stopped the bus for 15 minutes to do everything she could to make sure the rider was OK?  Absolutely not.

"Because people like you don't understand how vaccinations work.  That's why I have to worry.

Vaccinations don't provide 100% immunity to the disease vaccinated against.  I'm largely pulling this number out of my arse/feeble memory but it's often closer to 80 or 90%.

The reason we don't have massive childhood disease epidemics anymore is because widespread immunization has dropped the transmission rate below a sustainable rate for the virus.  Each person who gets sick infects less than one other person (because most of the people they encounter have been vaccinated and most of those vaccinated people are immune).

Where we get into real trouble is when there are enough unvaccinated kids to increase the transmission rate above 1.  Even briefly.  That's when we have an outbreak.  And most of the kids who get sick and suffer the consequences were kids whose parents didn't fuck around with their children's health.  The vaccines simply aren't 100% effective on an individual level, it's only across the broad population that they stop epidemics.",,,,SubParMarioBro,Magnolia,,1461654346,t5_2qhad,t3_4gge45,t1_d2hmcaf,25,1463696532,0,0,d2hnikr,Seattle,25,,flair

"Sadly this is not a new story. These kinds of games occur at all levels of sport in all areas of the country. I lived in a community in oil country where an unusual number of jobs were offered to men with seriously tall sons. The perks that came with the jobs included ease in finding housing at lower than market costs and (surprise!) tutors at the high school where they (another surprise!) played basketball. A college ball player who dated a family member just laughed at the stories. Shaking hands with any booster after a game resulted in tightly folded bills with large numbers being pressed into palms. Grades were a joke. No - not a podunk college, either. This was a Division 1 school. The only difference in the current Bellevue situation is the righteous indignation and the accusations that the investigation has racist overtones. It's an old, old game and it's cheating. It's buying wins and it's nasty. Shame on the boosters, the coaches, and everyone who's playing along. I'm not wild about many of the ST's positions, but I'm with them on this one.

We moved to Ballard when it was full of blue collar workers, ( lots of retired Scandinavian fishermen too) and our friends and family, who were having customized homes built in the suburbs, were slightly derisive, because why would we want to live in a lite industrial neighborhood, in a 100yr old house, when we could go through the character building process ;) of working with contractors and inspectors, not to mention being behind schedule and over budget?

We are very blue collar which can mean unpredictable employment, so we opted to keep our expenses down. ( we also had our kids in private schools longer than we expected)
Now our home is worth more than those twice as big and a century newer.

I've spent time traveling and working in other countries. While my work would often provide a translator or translation services for things that were work related I was on my own for everything else. I guarantee you that if I had a child in a Mexican school they would tell me to learn to speak Spanish.

Also, we have a budget issue in this state when it comes to public school. I think the money would be better spent directly on student education. It would be a considerable drain on the budget to hire multiple translators for every conceivable language and then have them sitting around in each and every school doing absolutely nothing most of the time except collecting a paycheck.

As far as I'm concerned the parents that have trouble speaking and/or understanding English have the same two options here that they have in any other country.

"I can confirm it (discrimination on income source) is a valid issue.

A couple years ago I assisted a friend from high school in moving out here to the Seattle area from a bad situation in rural Kentucky.   She is considered officially disabled from a snowmobiling accident that crushed/cracked 3 vertebra and left her with lifetime pain issues and some metal in her spine, but is smart (graduated 2nd in her class, etc), strongwilled and continues to try and rehab and better herself.  

Due to all this she has SSDI and Section 8 for income and housing.  I took her around to several apartments in the outer reaches of the county that said they accepted section 8 vouchers.  Everything about her as a tenant was good:  Quiet, pleasant middle aged woman, perfectly clean record, no pets, very good but meager credit (always responsible).  Almost all of the apartments we looked at still had 3/3.5 times the total rent amount income/garnishable source requirement, even though after the section 8 voucher her responsibility was a tiny amount, like $100 a month.     Her disability plus voucher only gave her around 2.5x, so 'Sorry, try somewhere else' was always the answer.

After a couple years of less-than-ideal roommate situations to keep the voucher, she finally got a place of her own a couple months ago.

I'm not sure if what the mayor is proposing would cover her situation, but it struck me that the places that accepted section 8 were set up to exclude the majority of people who would have it.  I can understand the desire to filter out tenants perceived as likely to be a problem, but it hurts a lot of good people who are in less than 'ideal' situations.

EDIT: The situation I just detailed above seems like one where the alternate income guidelines should be used.  Since the section 8 payment goes direct to the landlord, and comes from the govt, so there is zero question about the reliability of that part of the payment.  

Using approximate numbers from her situation to illustrate: She's applying for a $1000/month apt, with section 8 paying $900, and her paying $100, and her SSDI income is at $1500/mo (note there's no taxes taken out, and she's got full medicade, etc).  They say, ""nope that's only $2400 a month and you needed $3000 or $3500 to qualify, no apartment for you.""  And she's saying, ""I get 15x the amount I have to pay and that's not good enough?""     So with factors like that I can defiantly see how alternate guidelines are needed to make it fairer.  

Ironically, with the above numbers, if she had a ""proper job"" and grossed $3000 a month, she would have less than $2400 a month in take home pay ( minus 7.65% FICA, ~10% Fed Withholding, $400+/month for Govt Mandated Health Insurance, etc ), but would be able to qualify for the apartment at 3x income.

"Im new to the state and this was my forst experience with a caucus system. This was the least organized and productive thing i have ever been a part of. What a complete waste of time and resources.  Democracy in action apparently looks like a bunch of nutty democrats in a public school gymnasium killing time while untrained and confused last minute volunteers run the show. Waited 5+ hours for them to check people in and to figure out how many alternates they need while they killed time by letting people speak in support of their candidate, drawn g the loudest and least informed or prepared people from the crowd to drop some truth bombs on everyone else. 

I feel completely unheard and disenfrachised as a voter and supporter of the party. A popular vote would be a much welcomed and improved system. Caucuses seem to exist to let people pretend to be involved while the leaders watch laughing and pick whoever they want to be the candidate regardless of who votes for who. All the caucus seemed to accomplish was to get a everyone to fill out a ""sign in sheet"" so the party gets our information to harrass us for money to put on more shit shows like today. There was even a donation portion on the bottom. The party provided little guidance and organization and wasted everyones time and has the audacity to ask for money while they do it. 

The democratic party is a joke and the party leaders in Washington should be embarassed.  If you want people to help pick a candidate then fine, do it in a way that actually reflects the consensus of your members like a popular vote, no delegates, no rounding up/down to the nearest delegate thiusdands of times to the point where it throws off the vote by 20%. No changing the alternate rules last minute to help the candidate the leaders want and nit who the people chose. 

All i can say is if there was a viabke indendant candidate I wouldnt have taken part of this charade. Im furious and think less of the democratic party after today. ",,,,canyoubelivethisguy,,,1460974553,t5_2qhad,t3_4f9z1i,t3_4f9z1i,23,1463519346,0,0,d27clav,Seattle,23,,

"Here's my suggestion as someone who has to deal with other people's dog poop on a regular basis. If the can still contains a trash bag, put the poop in that bag. Don't just drop it in the can, because the trash collector may just grab the bag without looking for loose trash. If the trash has already been collected, don't put your poop in there. Otherwise, you're forcing an unwilling person to deal with your dog shit, which is just a jerk thing to do.

If I can't put my trash can away before work, there's about a 40% chance I will find a bag of poop in there when I get home.

It's not an excuse, it's a reason. There needs to be sufficient reason to extend the hours in the first place. Seattle doesn't have nearly the late night activity as Chicago, has less than a handful of 24 hr establishments, and has a pretty confined ""bar scene"" which shuts down from 1:30-2, unlike Chicago's 4 am bar laws.

Later hours to serve bar patrons also means the ensuing custodial work to clean up after the drunk riders.

The purpose of light rail networks should be to provide many stops in a smaller/denser area.

"This author is on drugs or something.  First off, it just bleeds the downer Seattle attitude that is just every bit as grey as January here.  The idea that Seattle isn't a great city is ridiculous.  The idea that Seattle hasn't been growing cyclically since WWII is ridiculous.  Imagine if this article were written in the 20s and the target was lamenting the effect Boeing was having on the city (and not Amazon).  My dad bought a house on the top of Queen Anne for $18k in 1970 as a blue collar worker and it wasn't a fixer upper.  He sold it in the 80s and that investment has ensured his retirement.  He wouldn't have been able to retire without it, and I know he is not alone.  That is because of growth. To suggest growth is only good for realtors and tax collectors is hogwash, and to suggest South Lake Union used to be funky (instead of a more appropriate term such as dump) is equally ridiculous.  

He uses San Francisco as a model which we used to aspire to but no longer.  If he actually spent any time in San Francisco he would know that it is a beautiful city.  People really do leave their hearts there.  Rents are high, yes, but SF has something that Seattle does not, rent control.  My friends have very nice Victorian flats that are reasonably affordable.  San Francisco has wonderful public transportation. Things change and always have on the cities of the west.  Get used to it.

As far as I'm concerned if anything needs to get run out of town it is writers (I'm looking at you Danny Westneat) who seem to complain incessantly about what a seemingly awful place Seattle is becoming to live in.  We live in the middle of a boom cycle for Seattle in a gold rush like age.  Things are very very good here.  They are good for the tech workers, the construction workers, and yes, the retirees like my father.  Get over it and spend some time writing something positive about how awesome it is to live here.

"If you look at the history of Seattle, you will understand that having the expectation that you have is unrealistic. That is putting it mildly.

Until the influence of Boeing (i.e., 1940s and 1950s), the people who came to Seattle were generally getting away from something else. When you look at the industries that thrived here (furriers, trade to gold prospectors, prostitution), you can see the DNA of the city laid out before you and it makes perfect sense. People chose not to ask too many questions because ""you didn't want to know"" the answers and a certain steady reserve was built into the culture.

Personally, I like it. If you study Japanese and/or Northern European cultures, you see similar types of social reserve. It's the desire to ""save face"" and maintain a polite exterior. I dig it a lot, because let's be honest ... I don't really WANT too many people in my business and I'm generally assuming others feel the same way.

"Geoff Baker is a shill for his bosses on the Seattle Times Editorial Board. Implying that ""because a smaller arena works in Sacramento, it will work in Seattle"" is ignorant as hell. He might as well be a Port of Seattle union rep at this point.

"Texas taught me the truth of that concept.   I lived there when they voted to allow a lottery, with the big deal being that the lottery revenue would go towards education.

But they didn't say it could ONLY go to education.  So it was just dumped into the general fund and all school funding went on like usual.   

When questioned, they said the revenue was funding education.

(I don't remember real numbers, but the concept will be clear.)  So the state budget for education was 200m before the lottery,  the lottery raised 250 million.   The state budgeted 200m for next years education and put the other 50m in the general fund.  So technically, 200m from the lottery was spent on education.

A better example is New Mexico, they made it law that lottery revenue can ONLY be used for education.   2 years later every graduating student in New Mexico was automatically approved for a one year scholarship to any New Mexico University, but would need a 2.5 GPA to retain the scholarship after the first year.
And every school district was upgrading its facilities.

"$4,300 a month in rent? Boo freaking hoo, cry me a damn river. To put $4,300/month in mortgage terms, google's handy mortgage calculator suggests that this couple could afford a loan of $900,000 (4% interest) + down payment. That means this couple is looking at the simply awful prospect of buying a $1m+ home. How the hell can't they manage to find anything with that kind of budget? Are they just that picky? I'd kill for that budget right now.

Also, if they felt the squeeze at $4,300 in rent, a quick search on Zillow shows 94 rentals with 3+ bedrooms at $3,000/mo or less within city limits, most in good neighborhoods. Look harder next time and don't try and make me feel sorry for you.

"The only reason it got built in the first place was because originally, First Hill was going to get a light rail station in the University Link Light Rail extension that just opened.  However, engineers said that drilling a tunnel under first hill was a big engineering risk, and would bring much higher than anticipated construction costs.  Something about the geology under First Hill was a big barrier to the decision not to drill a tunnel there.

So in July 2005, Sound Transit removed the First Hill Light Rail station from its plans, and changed the route to what it is today.

Are you pregnant?!"" 

As much as I hate being overweight, it is a far superior option to what I was 6 years ago, which was anorexic. This comment was so fucking damaging to someone struggling with that. I filed a formal complaint and had a phone interview with the head of that airport's TSA, and now have the information needed to request a screening from him personally to ensure I never encounter anything like that again.

"There are three main reasons that Seattle has chosen to experiment with Streetcars rather than just running more buses.  Whether you find them convincing is another matter.  

1)  Streetcars have a higher capacity and lower maintenance cost than buses.  Of course they cost a lot more to set up as well.  

2)  Tourists will ride street cars, because rail is tourist friendly.  A very large percentage of tourists will never be comfortable enough to ride a city bus.  If you want to move tourists in large numbers, you need rail.

3)  The streetcar system is the only part of the public transportation mix in the area that is controlled entirely by the City of Seattle.  The Link system is basically going to be a regional system that has most of it's track in the suburbs, and every decision made is going to be a compromise for city needs.  The Metro and Sound Transit buses are also regional systems that aren't designed to meet city needs exclusively.  With the Streetcar, the city can decide where it goes to meet it's own needs.

"My understanding is that the viaduct closure has little to do with ""it might collapse unexpectedly and injure people while we are digging under it"" since the surface roads UNDER the viaduct will remain open.

The closure is more about the vibrations from automotive use masking normal to moderate vibrations from the tunneling, thus making it harder to detect problems until it is too late. Closing the viaduct to automobiles improves the signal-to-noise ratio for monitoring equipment.

So, I expect that if the machine is broken, and not moving, that they will be able to re-open the viaduct while they decide if/how to fix the problem.",,,,TheRiverOtter,West Seattle,,1461612329,t5_2qhad,t3_4ge18r,t1_d2gwkl6,20,1463684073,0,0,d2gxef6,Seattle,20,,flair

In Seattle (and anywhere really), recommend finding an activity/hobby to pour yourself into, and friends will follow.

Also, by learning something new or taking something you already do to the next level, your confidence will grow and make you happier.

"Well, we had a trolley system, it was extensive but in truth, but from what I recall hearing, it wasn't good by the standards we expect today.

The trackage was at-grade and often poorly laid. The. Company that built it in the first place owned a ton of street railway companies, but never had a good plan for capital investment to support it once it was in place. In 1918, the company was losing money and in an insider deal, the money-losing company was bailed out by the city. Remind you of anything?

Anyhow, by the time it was torn out, the right of way had aged, sunken and shifted to the point that the trains were significantly slower than the traffic around them. Repairing it or replacing it would have taken a larger investment than the city was remotely interested in making, particularly at the end of the Great Depression.

I'm a transit fan, but it was time for it to go. I only wish we'd replaced it with a more modern grade-separated system in the post-war years, when we as a nation were flush with cash. ",,,,ctishman,,,1459704785,t5_2qhad,t3_4d4z1o,t3_4d4z1o,12,1463191484,0,0,d1o9pdm,Seattle,12,,

"I am not sure how many would agree with my sentiment, but I cannot wait to see how the Central City Connector http://www.seattlestreetcar.org/docs/SeaStcar_C3_Boards_final.pdf    will transform downtown. Due to overlapping the SLU and FH lines the downtown section will have streetcars running every five minutes in their own lane.  The most important piece about this connection will be to ensure SDOT gives signal priority at every single light along First Ave. 

The project boards linked above show travel times of 7 minutes between Westlake and Pioneer Square at rush hour...that is faster than the clogged transit tunnel right now.  Not only will this help provide more options for transit users in downtown, but it provides a new template on how to truly utilize streetcars in America.  One of the huge benefits to this line is the construction timeline.  The connection will be a little over a mile long, and can be built in 12 months...12 months!

"Traditional Econ 101 supply/demand curves apply to commodities, and it doesn't work the same way for fixed assets with harder limits on supply and fewer alternatives for consumers to turn to. 

Supply/ demand curves on commodities function, because if a supplier's price is too high, a consumer can easily turn to a competitor for a mutual substitution of the product.

With rental housing, the supplier isn't necessarily trying to sell the largest *volume* of products, but maintain a high rental price for long-term profit margins. With immobile assets in a constrained pool of suppliers (limited total housing stock), large rental property owners have an incentive to maintain high prices, rather than lower them to simply fill up empty units. 

With rental properties in geographically desirable areas of Seattle, there are few competing mutual substitutions forcing suppliers (property owners) to lower prices. ",,,,lil_vega,,,1459808351,t5_2qhad,t3_4dbnlh,t1_d1pmg6q,12,1463219816,0,0,d1px6xp,Seattle,12,,

"Came here cause of the best of post and wanted to share my similar experience. 


Started dreaming of moving to San Francisco since my first visit at 13 years old. When I was 23 I packed up and moved there (in 2002). It was an amazing experience at times, but it was also horribly painful and lonely and I got very depressed. When stuck in the fits of depression I saw no way out, no way to combat the loneliness, and no end to the situation i put myself in. While I did have some great times, the experience as a whole was a megaphone for my underlying depression that I always carried but was unaware of. 



I moved away 2 years later back home. I started seeing a therapist, I got my depression under control, and found balance. Now here I am, 12 years after retreating from the Bay Area, I am now 2 years into my return to the Bay, happy and healthy and not at all lonely. I knew the loneliness and depression would pop up again, so while I was still of clear mind, i got preventative therapy, I found new hobbies, and I got a dog (who ended up honestly becoming the best friend i've ever had). 



I often opt to spend my free time alone because i am around people every day with my business, but it's amazing how keeping a healthy mind and positive mindset can pay dividends on your social life. So as futile as it feels when you are down and out, just be prepared for the day when you're feeling a little better, capitalize on it. Throw on some music you love, get that energy, and just get out and work to make changes to get out of your funk.

"Here's what we saw during the AM, FYI, according to our traffic engineers monitoring from the transportation management centers:
On state highways, traffic slightly heavier than usual (more like a mid-week commute than a Friday commute) with congestion forming about 35-45 minutes earlier than usual, and backed up a couple more miles than usual on I-5. NB I-5 backed up to the Duwamish River from downtown, SB I-5 backed up from 405 to Northgate. Traffic on 405 backed up to SR 522 (which is kind of typical in all three of those instances for the AM from my observations).
Seattle DOT reported heavy to moderate traffic on city street alternate routes. Some some limited backups near Colman Dock and some backups related to collisions but the collisions were cleared quickly. They made some adjustments to some traffic control plans around Battery Street. The real heavy spot is 4th Avenue and 1st St. areas.
King County Metro said they mostly saw normal loads, with some northbound congestion in Sodo. They've used a few of their standby coaches to try to maintain their normal schedule.

"Nintendo bought the Mariners 100% as a favor to Howard Lincoln, their US head, who was a big baseball fan and a mover-and-shaker in trying to get the team to stay in the US.

Lincoln was also the person who was most responsible for Nintendo's success in the United States, working closely with Yamaouchi's son-in-law, Mr. Arakawa, to build Nintendo of America to the massive juggernaut of success it was in the USA.

Without Howard Lincoln, it's highly unlikely Nintendo today would be anything like what it is, so buying the Mariners was a way for Yamouchi to reward Lincoln.

Correct. This is why landlords and developers hate this bill: it forces them to bear the cost of inspecting and keeping up their properties. From a moral perspective, why wouldn't we want landlords to bear the risk of their own properties? Why would it be more ""right"" for your and my tax dollars to subsidize the enforcement on private landowners' responsibilities?

Seattle has become a magnet for New Yorkers, Bostonians, Angelinos, Chicagoans, and Bay Area types fleeing the places they created.

"As a incredibly understaffed Pierce Transit operator. No. Majority of the time it isn't the driver's fault, nor is there much he can do about it. A lot of the problems that cause bus delays are passengers themselves. By not being ready upon boarding/exiting. Or various other drama that can and does occur between riders. Also, a lot of the buses in the fleets are old and do break down. And, take into consideration that, like PT, Metro is in a hiring boom as well and you may have a new driver who isn't 100% sure about the routing.

Instead of being a total shit head to someone providing a ride home, just keep your fucking mouth shut and go take a goddamn seat. And just think about if you catch the wrong driver on a pretty shitty day for him. You could be eject off the bus or he may just snap and harm you. Besides, none of the other riders want to here you being a total shit. Especially if it causes the bus to be delayed even further.

The aftermath:

&gt; The 16-year-old male driver of the stolen vehicle led pursuing officers through West Seattle to Highland Park Drive SW, where it appears he crossed over the center line and struck a westbound 1996 Acura Integra.

"That was the hardest thing to get used to moving here. Coming from Denver, which is a small town that pretends it's a big city, everyone is nice and friendly and they invite you places and you can get friends and social life in a matter of months. My first year in Seattle/Tacoma was super lonely but I struggled through and now that I'm working through year 2 everyone is magically opening up to me. People I've talked to in passing are actually introducing themselves and the friendliness quotient has skyrocketed. They are right, it's a slow process. If you can struggle through eventually people finally open up to you and warm up. It's not instant like the mid-west. I can also confirm the winter thing. People do tend to stay in during the winter. Spring and Summer have people opening up far more. In Denver, we'll go party in a blizzard or have a blizzard party! That was hard to get used to. I also notice that I tend to stay home more now that I live here. When I lived in Denver I was always in my car going here and there and hanging out all around. Now, I tend to stay home. I go to coffee shops to work a few times a week but I don't go out every night of the week like I did in Denver and even if I wanted to I don't know where I would go anyway.

"Hoo boy, it's been a while for you, hasn't it?

Here are some (but not all) of the new parking rules.

You may park were signs say it is permitted at that time. This is obvious.

However, there are a lot of new unsigned rules about where you can't actually park even if the parking signs say you can, kind of like how you're not supposed to park too close to fire hydrants or crosswalks.

Some of those new rules:

You may not park on north-south streets with odd-numbered block addresses if it's a full moon or if it's during school hours and you're within 2500 feet of a public school.

You may not park within 10 feet of any lavender plant if it's currently blooming.

You may not park next to any P-patch or community vegetable garden displaying an ""organic"" or ""no spray zone"" sign at least 3 inches across *unless* you're driving a completely electric vehicle and you've signed up for a suitable organic power program through your electric company as the primary charge point that vehicle. (See SDOT appendix 23.12c subpart 20093 for a list of approved organic electricity providers.)

On any street with a dedicated bike lane or sharrow you may not park on the right hand side if you can count more than three cyclists within view.

You may not park near any blooming cherry tree but you may park directly under it.

If a crow or any corvid lands on your vehicle you must wait at least one hour until the last one leaves before you can approach, touch, enter or drive your vehicle.

If a homeless person occupies your un-possessed vehicle while you are away from it you must serve a written three day notice before an eviction filed in King County Municipal Court. After posting the three day notice and obtaining confirmation from SDOT that your vehicle has been unlawfully occupied you may file for an eviction between the hours of 11 AM and 2:30 PM Monday, Wed or Friday every other week, and the third Thursday of every month. Note that the Vehicular Eviction office is closed between 12:00-1:30 PM for lunch.

It's an LC9, the only safety on it is a heavy trigger pull and your brain. Only someone not picking it up, pointing it at someone and pulling the trigger is what prevented tragedy.

"Bus driver here. Yeah, we are not supposed to get in fare disputes. We are supposed to remind the individual of the fare. How long do you think it takes police to get somewhere in Seattle? We would be sitting at the stop for a while. Probably you would get off and walk home faster if I had to wait for police every time someone didn't want to pay. What I usually do is say something like ""I'm not allowed to tell you you can ride without paying."" That makes it so that the ball is in their court and they can decide what to do, and I'm not giving them permission, but I didn't tell them to fuck of. We are supposed to give them a transfer if they ask for one, again to avoid fare disputes, now and in the future. Some 90% of all operator assaults are about the fare. If I'm running behind though, you think I care about the fare? I just wanna be able to get out of the chair after a route, so I can eat, stretch, and decompress so I can be in a good mood for the next trip. So when I'm behind I am usually just like ""who cares sit down so I can move the bus."" We are supposed to write a security incident report after a shift if we had people who didn't pay get on, describing the individuals. Before I worked for metro and got a free bus pass, I always bought a pass, but personally I think the fare is dumb and we should just raise taxes, (I would be one of the people paying for it). Paying a fare takes time, and those who really can't afford to buy a pass every month I don't mind fronting the money for them.

"Part of it is the El Nino/La Nina cycle.

A third part yet is human contribution to climate change.  We're not causing it by ourselves, but we're definitely exacerbating the effects of the natural weather cycle with human activity.

"&gt; We're not saying that the ""fuck amazon"" crowd wanted it to stay a craphole. We're saying that SLU is better off a tech bro-scene than a garbage-hole.

Well... maybe. Maybe it is for that particular neighborhood. But it's impact on the rest of the city is not that great. Its made a handful of people rich (home owners selling to transplants at inflated values) but mostly, it just means a fuck load of people have to move away from their homes. I don't really see how thats a net positive. Especially when areas like capitol hill, once known for its gay and arts culture, is turning into a giant outdoor shopping mall for rich people. Expensive boutiques and pricey restaurants. Oh and the condo's literally no one but tech works can afford. That's a net positive?

And you're right, there are still little cool spots, but they're far and few between, and come on, be honest dude, when people find out about these spots they get a surge of popularity, property developers see the market opportunity, buy up all the cool shit, and knock it down. Literally exactly what happened to Belltown in the late 90's, Ballard in the early-mid 2000's, and Capitol Hill for the last 5 years, and now the CD. That is not a net positive. Thats kinda shitty actually for most of the people that lived there before.

I get that your trying to fight back against everyone who says ""fuck amazon"" because its not your fault. Which is true, its not directly youre fault, and obviously no one wants to feel responsible for displacing people. It sucks on both ends. But there's simply no way around the fact that tons of people are being displaced, are having a really hard time surviving in their own home town, all so amazon employees can show up and earn fun money. An online retailer. Not a hospital or a medical research firm. An online walmart. There is nothing noble about that profession. There's no point in downvoting me and these ideas. Theyre widespread, and I think it should be the responsibility of everyone moving here for a high paying tech job to understand what them moving here means to the community that was here first. Its arrogance and pure selfishness to discount all of us that are having our homes torn down for YOUR condos.

"Meetup... yes Meetup.  

I understand how you feel. I moved here from Hawaii 10 years ago and I still struggle day to day. It's HARD.  I play this game where I talk to strangers just to sometimes annoy the hell out of them. HA! They can't help but talk to me though because I have a killer smile and am pretty damned enjoyable to talk to. 

In all seriousness I still get homesick every single day, but what  helped me tremendously was finding a Seattle neighborhood that was a good fit for me. West Seattle; there's a sense of community here that I love.. even though lots of peeps are moving here and the hood is changing.. there are still friendly folks here, people speak to you, I speak to my neighbors, I adore it here, it reminds me a lot of how the people at home in Hawaii are, but I know a lot of it has to do with the type of attitude I project. I am a friendly approachable person, I smile at strangers, my demeanor welcomes conversation. 

Aside from that I've done quite a few Meetups to meet peeps.. some are better than others. The singles ones are THE WORST.. avoid them.  The art and culture ones are fun as are the music and foodie type Meetups. I'm hosting my first Meetup on the 18th. If you like live music you should come!  If you like comedy there's a comedy show Meetup at The Hard Rock tomorrow downtown.. I missed the last one but heard it was a fun time. 

Aside from that volunteering is another great way to meet some very nice people. Farestart is one of my favorites. 

I don't know how old you are.. I'm sure I'm probably a smidge older than you.. but who cares.. ya want a new friend.. PM me..give me a holler. I'll help you get out of the house.. Its tricky getting acclimated to Seattle.. it's a beautiful city.. but it's different. You've a LOT going for you.. don't let the blues get you.. give it time. You will LOVE it here.

Part 1- Person was treated by the first TSA employee in the same way everyone else is treated

Part 2- After realizing she'd have to go through the same long line as everyone else, women decides to suffer through pain instead of taking a few minutes to find a wheelchair.

Part 3 - An ignorant TSA employee attempted to engage her in polite conversation, but accidentally asked overly invasive questions in a failed attempt to connect socially

Part 4 - After recognizing that the TSA employees were actively communicating about a customer that needed assistance, said customer blurted out an accusative and disparaging remark about the TSA employees

Part 5 - TSA employees continuted proper screening procedures and the woman went on to her gate.

"I'm not sure I understand the authors point. He seems to assume that racial diversity is *the key metric* when determining the benefit of very forcibly integrating schools.

&gt;  They demonstrate greater willingness to talk about controversial topics across racial lines.

Okay so what about educational outcomes?

&gt; integrated schools helped people overcome fear and distrust of people who were different.

Okay so what about educational outcomes?

&gt; students in integrated schools have higher test scores, are more likely to enroll in college, are less likely to drop out of high school, are more creative, and solve problems better.

Compared to who/what? I'd be very interested in this data and this should have been the crux of the article but was somehow missing!

&gt; Five days a week, all day long, students from across the city would attend completely inclusive classes that examine race, class, and gender through the lenses of math, language arts, and other disciplines.

Uhh... Can someone explain how axiomatic mathematics has anything to do with race/cultural identity? Last time I was in school derivatives didn't discriminate!

&gt; Furthermore, the citizens of Seattle must demand more racially and socioeconomically integrated and balanced schools, supported by better funding from our state legislature. 

Once again why? There has been very little cited in the article that enumerates the benefits. Really the most crucial thing that I would want for my fake hypothetical kids is small class sizes with teachers that know their subjects well. That is literally never going to happen in public schools. I'd be willing to bet this is why those parents that can choose private schools for the most part do choose private schools purely for pragmatic reasons over racial issues. The conclusion that people are probably coming to is that if you cant change public schools for the benefit of your kids while they are still in school then put them in private school so you don't have to worry about it.

This is an argument shared by many for tipping in the restaurant industry. It's accepted and understood there, but one of the benefits of Uber was that it was free of this nonsense. If they aren't paying their drivers enough, they need to raise the rates, not have drivers set the expectation on the customer to tip.

Uber's model is supposed to be market-based. If there aren't enough drivers (because drivers exit the market because they aren't making enough) then the rates should and will go up to encourage additional drivers to enter the market. By tipping, you're throwing this off by disguising the actual price people are paying for rides (and the actual value drivers are earning per ride).

"Anecdotally I've tried to understand the complexities of this on a personal level when attending cons like PAX and ECCC. Fresh on my mind again having gone to ECCC. I was all over the computer from age 3-10. My dad wanted to teach me BASIC back in the day. I ignored the 6th grade Valentine party/movie to fix the donated Windows 3.1 computers in the back of our classroom (someone nuked all the program shortcuts teacher was a Mac person). Somewhere around junior high all this stuff was perceived as uncool and not things the other girls do/did. There is a lot of societal peer pressure to fit certain molds. I tried to take a networking class in high school which turned into a tear down and rebuild desktops class and identify components. I loved it, but all the guys in the class would edge me out of everything, I felt like the little sister that wasn't allowed to touch. The instructor was kind of a jaded old guy who I don't know if he had been laid off from the tech sector or what but he just handed us some CD Roms of a prep course for some cert that may or may not have been relevant back then. I ended up dropping the class and taking a multimedia class that was focused on using Hyperstudio and excelled in that course instead (does Hyperstudio even exist now?) and honestly it's probably why I'm a whiz at Power Point these days. I love tinkering with hardware but it wasn't until late in college when I found friends that were into that stuff that I felt comfortable exploring that interest and letting my geek flag fly. Going to cons makes me realize I probably lost a whole decade of options and education that would have gotten me a STEM career. Now I'm a STEM adjacent project manager, which is cool to see the stuff my team makes but I feel so left out wishing I could make cool things with them. I hope that the next generation I see at conventions letting their geek flags fly are more accepted by their peers and are able to pursue their interests!

"Sort of. Railroads were built in a fashion that could best be described as a paleolithic form of public/private partnership. They built the rails in the first place (largely) on federal land, with a great deal of assistance from the government in terms of finances, labor, et cetera.

This was done with the understanding that the final product would be used for both freight service (which can be immensely profitable) and passenger service (which is very rarely profitable). Unfortunately, passenger service was **so** unprofitable that it became rather ruinous to maintain in the down economy of the mid-to-late '70s.

Thus, the government in essence bailed out the railroads by buying out their unprofitable passenger divisions and nationalizing them into Amtrak. One of the pillars of this agreement is that the railroads have to allow Amtrak to run trains on ""their"" rails at a reasonable rate, and with a reasonable level of signal priority.

Sometimes this works, sometimes it doesn't, and occasionally there'll be lawsuits between the railroads and Amtrak over the details.

"Exurbia is where if you are a Seattle resident, you suddenly start to feel like you might be in the wrong part of town.  Building heights drop, pickup trucks and SUV start becoming normal, and Trump / MAGA signs start popping up.  There will be a clogged to the max 2-lane road overgrown by people attempting to get to the highway, yet none of them will want to vote for a transit solution because god damn government liberals want my hard earned money.

Exurbia is strongly conservative, whereas some suburbia will be middle of the road or even liberal.

Exburbia doesn't have much in the way of employment other than ranch, farm, or boutique stuff that moved out there like maybe a distillery now, or else a dog boarding place, maybe a driving range, quite possibly a gun range.  There will be loads of ""work at home"" stuff, from wedding planners to dog breeders to home school or day care in someone's home.  

Exburbia has the crappier roads, the roads with no signs, and the legacy farm or the just-built development of isolated townhomes where a farm just got sold and developed.  There may well be a big damn sign proclaiming the arrival of a big new batch of homes soon.   Regardless, there won't be enough roads yet, so the whole place is this bad mix of not enough grocery, not enough services, too far to the nearest mall or arterial highway, the road is 2 lanes but needs to be 5 or 6, and you're staring at an hour to get to work no matter what time of day you leave.  There'll be kids of varying origin walking along said roads to the gas station a half mile away, which is the nearest outpost of retail.  In very rare cases, a Metro bus stop for some weird number you never heard of will possibly be standing by the side of the road.

-- DiscNW which is a great community of Ultimate players, and very beginner friendly. Great sport.

-- The Mountaineers. If you want to hike or climb or take an outdoors class. Many folks in the club from Amazon and MSFT. Can be a bit nerdy, but if you are already at Amazon, you should be okay with all the nerds in The Mounties.

-- Meet Up. Many group activities to choose from.

"Why attack Ike's?  The guy that runs Ike's is on a quest for profit, and in that quest, he's done a lot of things that would make him unlikeable.  

Examples:  

* [He bought a vet-clinic and put a crappy arcade in it](http://www.capitolhillseattle.com/2015/07/capitol-hill-family-arcade-and-a-new-home-for-angels-shoe-repair-latest-twists-in-quest-to-open-first-capitol-hill-pot-shop/).  The only purpose of the arcade was to provide a legal hurdle for a competitors pot-shop.  Obviously the intent was never announced, but anyone with half a brain new what Eisenberg was up to.  (the arcade has since closed). 
* When the city was attempting to loosen restrictions on new pot-shops, Eisenberg testified to the council: ""I urge caution when adjusting buffers…the buffers exist for a reason and have served their purpose well"".  I think he was being disingenuous, and was more interested in limiting competition. (http://www.seattlemet.com/articles/2016/1/13/the-state-of-the-state-pot-and-bathrooms)
* The construction of Uncle Ike's started without a publicly displayed land use notification.  I'm not a lawyer so I don't know the legality of this, but I do live in the neighborhood and I can say that no one had any idea what was happening with that building until a few weeks before the pot shop opened.  I believe that the church, adjacent to the property, is being honest when they say they were blindsided by the businesses opening.

Bottom line, I guess that business can be dirty and that's just capitalism and so whatever.  Ike's, in my opinion, is trying to corner a market, and he's not above using unscrupulous methods to do so.  This may not bother people but I know enough about the guy that I'll be voting with my wallet and taking my business elsewhere (Ponder is just as good, has less of a line, and is only two blocks away, after all, and there's a reason why it's *not being targeted* by the protesters).

You are describing something known as the [Seattle Freeze](http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/eight-easy-steps-to-help-you-break-through-the-dreaded-seattle-freeze/Content?oid=21567038).  People rarely talk to strangers for anything more than platitudes, which is why you didn't have any luck on your walk.  So how DO you meet people here?  Try a [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/).  Volunteer.  Join a club.  Visit a makerspace, there's on on [Capitol Hill on Broadway and Roy](http://www.metrixcreatespace.com/).  I joined a choir.  There is a lot of good armature culture here.

Don't drive unless your leaving the city.  Traffic is awful and our drivers are worse.  It's much easier to navigate the city on foot and public transportation.  It's also much better on your anger levels.

Amazon may pay well but their work-life balance is terrible and their culture is terrible.  I am not surprised you find them ""disengenuous and overtly professional.""  This isn't necessarily the case at other companies.  There is lots of technology in Seattle.  Are you a Java developer?  Learn Ruby on Rails, NodeJS, AngularJS, ReactJS, or Ember and you will do well here.  Learn C# if you'd like to work at Microsoft, but their culture isn't much better than Amazon.

"I'm kind of conflicted with this. I think it is obvious that the junction needs a connection to downtown via this light rail project. Beyond that I can't decide. Selfishly, I love the idea of it going down 35th or California and hitting Morgan Junction and the ferry. That's right where I live and there are lots of other middle/ upper middle class folks who live in these areas who also need to get downtown for work. It's a dream. 

That said, I feel like a delridge route would better serve a demographic of West Seattleites and White center folks who probably need reliable mass transit more than folks like me. It may not be easy for someone trying to get to work downtown who doesn't have a car to get up from delridge or highland park over to the west side of the peninsula. I feel like part of a regional transit offering like this should consider the fact that this could be a real opportunity to include services that would potentially alleviate some of the day to day pain of under-served communities by making their life easier and potentially allowing them to contribute to the community in other diverse ways once transportation is factored out of their every day list of stuff to deal with/ worry about.

"You were warehoused with your peer group most of your waking hours when you were a kid - aka ""school system"".  Not only that, there was a touch of adversity to bond you together: the shitty impatient teacher, the assignment you all hated.  Its you against the system.  Its easy to make friends in that environment.  But its a contrived, institutional environment. In fact, one could say the environment itself forces a type deliberate friendship-making: its not as organic as you think if you examine it closely.

""Normal life"" means you interact with all ages, all interests, etc...  We are all so specialized in our interests, goals and dreams.  Think of how many *possible* interests there are out there that people can have - hundreds.  No wonder its tough to meet people with the same interests and values.

You have a logistical problem - that's all. Don't look at it as ""I can't make friends"".  Look at it dispassionately - like a sales job.  An experienced salesperson knows that they have to talk to 25 people before they make a sale.  Treat it like job hunting - knuckle down and increase the number of people you meet.

FWIW: I am one of the older farts on Reddit - its a life long problem that many people have.  You are utterly normal.  In fact, I'd say that only a tiny percentage of people I've met in my life are so thoroughly extroverted they had tons of friends.  Most struggle; I have been in your place.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_blocking

Pro tips:

* Towel - bring one to sit on, FYI it will get semi-destroyed.
* Ice - they sell giant ice blocks at most local grocery stores, call first to be sure.
* Kindness to others &amp; the park - don't run into people, also don't go too much down the exact same spot to be kinder on the grass.",,,,Fiveafter,,,1460060803,t5_2qhad,t3_4dsth4,t3_4dsth4,12,1463290204,0,0,d1u0vbm,Seattle,12,,

"Actually, if your hope is to kill the tunnel project you want a total Bertha breakdown -- a critical, super hard to repair one -- basically around zone 6 or 7. That's right under Pike Place Market's main building and some SUPER expensive real estate. 

There is literally no chance you could ever get away with digging a rescue pit on Pike Street there, on first there, or to sacrifice the Market to the Bertha Gods. Never happen. Also, most don't know this, but if you're standing at the Market at Rachel and the flying fish guys, looking toward West Seattle and the Olympic Peninsula, you're on the edge of a HUGE cliff. The Market is build on top of it. Have fun with *that* geological stability on rescue access, with how competent this drilling team is already proving to be.

Your rescue pit/access options become:

* Lose the viaduct/SR99, go UNDER the Market.
* Sacrifice either 1st or 2nd for over a year.

If you wanted to kill the project, that's where you want it to happen. At that point, any Mayor or City Council that didn't come out in force against the tunnel project loses next election. No misplaced or foolish loyalty to retired elected officials who orchestrated this all -- Gregoire, Sims, Nickels, Conlin -- will matter.

Article points out this guy is a repeat laser-idiocy offender.  The Coast Guard isn't pulling any punches in pointing out hazards (i.e. - at the distance between ferries, most laser beams are going to disperse quite a bit from such a tight focus).

&gt;The fine isn't Raden's first run-in with the law over alleged misuse of a laser. An Island County judge has ordered him to stay away from lasers. Raden is accused of shining an industrial laser — a model powerful enough to start fires — at a police officer in July and then the two ferry captains in October. In both of the cases, he is charged with felonies in Island County Superior Court.  Both cases are scheduled for trial in June.

&gt;Raden also was accused of a third incident last year involving a laser, but that didn't lead to charges.

&gt;The laser that zapped the Tokitae in October was confiscated by the Washington State Patrol, which polices the state ferry system. In forensic testing, the laser was pointed at a piece of wood. “The piece of wood immediately began to darken and smoldered in about 3 seconds, with visible smoke coming off,” a trooper wrote. “It was obvious the laser was a hazard and could be used as a weapon.”",,,,ChefJoe98136,West Seattle,,1461969779,t5_2qhad,t3_4h1x7i,t3_4h1x7i,41,1463782972,0,0,d2moe0x,Seattle,41,,flair

I am glad SDOT has done this. It is the first step in limiting street space in this one area.  It allows people to get used to the idea of losing the street area and adapting their driving habits.

20% service charge. Only 10% of that is going to the server. 5% is going to be dispersed to support staff and 5% is going to THE HOUSE. This means Schwartz Bros Restaurants are turning their employees into a new source of revenue for the company. 

Long-time servers who have perfected their craft and regularly earn around 20% in tips on each customer check are looking to lose between $800 - $1,100 every month.

"I've had lifelong allergies and used to be miserable for weeks at a time in the spring but finally found a daily drug that works for me and is cheap.  Personally Costco Kirkland Signature Aller-Tec (Cetirizine Hydrochloride, generic Zyrtec) works great for around $12 a year.  For me the key is to take it daily for the whole allergy season and not try to use it as needed.  Keep trying daily non-sedating antihistamines and see if there's one that works well.  

If I experience some sort of break through reaction, which is infrequent with daily antihistamines, then I've got a routine now.  Big dose of diphenhydramine (Benadryl), saline nasal irrigation [with a squeeze bottle](http://shop.neilmed.com/Sinus-Rinse-K-ENU-US-Complete-Kit/dp/B000A0S5KC?field_availability=-2&amp;field_browse=9814764011&amp;id=Sinus+Rinse+K-ENU-US+Complete+Kit&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;refinementHistory=subjectbin%2Cprice&amp;searchNodeID=9814764011&amp;searchPage=1&amp;searchRank=-product_site_launch_date&amp;searchSize=12), and attempt to escape the allergen.  If I'm really having a hard time I'll take a dose or two of oxymetazoline hydrochloride (Afrin) as a last resort to dry me up and deal with severe nasal congestion but be aware that regular use can cause dependency.  

Be a good patient and play the long game.   Figuring out what works for you is totally worthwhile.  Watch the [pollen counts](http://www.nwasthma.com/pollen/pollen-count/). Try to keep a diary/journal of symptoms and treatments so you can identify patterns or successful treatments. If you can't figure it out on your own start with your primary care provider and see an allergist if they don't offer successful treatment strategies.  If you are in a stable living situation a year or two of allergy shots could be a long term solution.

"Someday I will write the history of liveaboards in Puget Sound. But not tonight. :)

It's an enormously complicated story with a lot of different motivations and perspectives. They've changed over time and as much of it is down to individuals in power at any particular time (which, in turn, reflect the views of the electorate) as it is with the stance of government generally.

A lot of people think of liveaboards as freeloaders of some sort who are just putting one over on the system. There's jealously and misunderstanding that goes with that, and the numbers and nature of liveaboards is such that they have almost no political presence. Consequently, it's been easy to score political points over the years by pinning problems on a group which has no ability to fight back. The blame takes on a life of its own over time.

It's interesting to contrast that with the local houseboat community, which was similarly persecuted at one point, but had the money and organizational ability to fight back politically and secure a niche for themselves.

"&gt; Unless you are proposing doing away with security checks altogether

I believe that is exactly what /u/nukem996 is suggesting.

I flew last week and the airline sent me an email advising me to expect delays due to ""enhanced security procedures"". Lines were definitely longer than normal, but the TSA wasn't doing anything differently; they were just operating fewer lanes.

But beyond that, the entire reason for the ""enhanced security"" was the recent Brussels attacks, which everyone seems to have completely forgotten *took place outside of the secure zone*. Enhanced security checkpoints do **nothing** to deter or prevent attacks that take place in the accessible portion of the airport, and backing up massive lines for security checks only provides a more target-rich environment for such an attack.

The number one thing that has improved security in the post 9/11 world is passenger awareness. Previously, if somebody attempted to hijack a plane, passengers would comply out of fear that they might come to harm. They believed that staying quiet could save them. No one believes this anymore. If you were to produce a box cutter on a passenger flight today, the other passengers would tear you limb from limb. They know that doing nothing is likely a death sentence anyway. Even if the attacker had a gun, he would not survive long enough to take control of the plane.

Maybe some basic screening for explosives or firearms (like we had prior to 9/11) would be prudent. But the TSA in its current form is nothing but an act, and it is an expensive and inconvenient one at that.",,,,Emberwake,Queen Anne,,1460072983,t5_2qhad,t3_4drsc9,t1_d1u7z5j,13,1463294321,0,0,d1u9kij,Seattle,13,,flair

Some of my brethren were not cool.  There's a difference between standing up for yourself and being plain rude.  

Pramila Jayapal gave a good speech, 2 hours after she was supposed to be there and an hour after the Clinton rep spoke, but she shouldn't have agreed to do it if she couldn't manage her schedule properly.  It made us look stupid.  And when she finally showed up, 1/3 of the crowd had already left.  

Regarding the organization, how is it that the self-nomination table closes at 2PM but you don't even start printing the ballots until 6?  Or that you only have 1 printer producing a ballot every 3 seconds?  Did anyone think to get more than 1 inkjet for the goddamned process?  If you have 20 years experience running these events how the hell does that happen?  

To the dumbass who nominated the kid to challenge Marcee Whatever for district party chair:  Clearly the organization was lacking in some areas, but do you really think an 18 year-old (maybe he was even 17) can effectively run a party for a district encompassing several hundred thousand people, at least 200 precincts, and 2 cities plus a large unincorporated area?  Nothing against the kid, but he's simply too young.  Let him learn and observe at least 1 election cycle prior to putting him in a post of such responsibility.  And as a result we were there 1.5 hours more than necessary.  Thanks a lot. 

To the assholes who agreed to be delegates and alternates but didn't show up: eat a dick.  You cost me 2 hours while all of the re-assignment around precincts took place.  

And 7.5 hours later we left not having seen a fucking ballot, not having heard a speech from a delegate who wanted to move forward to the next round, and not having seen any of the final results.  Because by that point it was obvious that we would have had to stay another 3 hours for a pretty minimal effect.

No, being a petty thief is not justification for getting shot, that is why he wouldn't be facing a death sentence if he had been arrested.

Since as you may know that happens a lot in robberies gone bad.  Also, this guy even has the fact his wife was recently shot in a robbery as his own personal experience.

He should've put the gun down when the thief turned his back.  But in that situation the time between him deciding to fire and the thief turning around are seconds happening in a state of mind harkening back to our most primitive survival instincts.

"Consolidation doesn't always mean better quality, especially when it results in monopoly.

Also, I started out as a KUOW listener until the outcry over the KPLU sale. At that point, I wanted to see what differences in news programming could possibly warrant such a strong popular resistance to the sale. I now listen to KPLU.

It's been clear to me for a while that KUOW raises obscene amounts of money during its drives. Stations in other places I've lived raise less by as much as an order of magnitude, yet those stations offered more original news and educational programming than KUOW.

Additionally, KUOW rubs me the wrong way by spending its newsroom funds rewriting the bumpers between stories on All Things Considered and Morning Edition instead of allowing the nationally-produced stuff to air—essentially creating no value for the listener, dumping the editorial music choices for the same song repeated many times, and often framing the stories as if they were reported *for* KUOW. Add to that sparse local reporting that is neither in-depth nor broad, with local stories that re-air several times a day for a week at a time.

"It takes 30 minutes under absolutely ideal conditions. They never are though, and won't be until the 520 bridge is completely done sometime around the summer of 2017. If you took transit, it would most likely be over the 520 bridge. I can't say much about the mornings, since I drive south to 90 and across mercer island to avoid a toll, but in the evenings I drive over the 520. There's two lanes, and they're backed up from the seattle side all the way past 405 to the east.

Honestly, you're looking at an hour+ standing on a bus if you go that route. (unconfirmed from my side, just rough estimation)

Living in Bellevue is pretty neat. (driving) It takes me &lt;30 minutes to get to South Lake Union in the morning on the long way around, and only 15 minutes to get home over 520, even at peak rush hour.

"Isn't it slightly offensive to suggest that a woman is shallow, empty, or weak if she gives in to societal pressure? Men give in to pressure as well. And, there is still real pressure for women to prioritize her family over her career.
It's not like 35 year old women are being TOLD to quit their jobs and raise babies, but when their CHOICE is to watch their child be primarily raised by a stranger or to quit their job and raise the child herself, maybe it's not so shocking that a woman would CHOOSE to give in to the pressure of being a mom. (Conversely, when her choice is to let her husband raise the child and pick her career, it's easy to see why she'd pick her career.)

Moreover, it's a choice many men aren't often faced with because the media more rarely makes men out to be ""lesser"" parents for being gone at work for 12 hours a day. The media still paints that as a picture of the hard-working father who loves his family. Women get painted by the media as not being good enough moms when they fit the workaholic-stereotypes. Ergo, ""pressure"".

"To your last question, because racism at UW is a big issue right now (always has been, but it's finally getting some attention from academic leadership).

"No, you won't necessarily know if it's safe.  You'll only know if it's not safe.

The problem with galvanized pipe is that it corrodes on the inside and the crusty surface can accumulate lead from the old lead water main fittings that supply the water to your house.  That accumulation can stay in your pipe for years, even after the city's lead pipe/fittings have been replaced with safer alternatives.  Just to be clear, galvanized pipe doesn't contain lead (it's steel w/zinc coating), but it can accumulate lead in the water supply as it begins to corrode.  Copper and plastic plumbing obviously doesn't have the corrosion problem.

  
Your test may say the water is OK, but later that corrosion works loose either from seismic activity, water hammer effects (hydraulic pulse from turning on/off the faucet quickly), or the city flushing its lines and then a larger quantity of trapped lead comes out of your faucet.

"I totally understand what you are saying, but what you need to understand is my child looks REALLY cute running around in the tulips. 

I get that she is trampling and picking somebody's product that they intend to sell, but they will just roll the cost of the lost tulips into the price of the rest of their flowers, so they will get that money eventually. And can you really put a price on my daughter looking this ADORABLE? No, you can't. 

You should consider yourself privileged to see my daughter surrounded by flowers. The fact that your child isn't as cute as mine shouldn't prevent the rest of the world from getting to see these great photos on Facebook. 

So while I understand your point, and I HATE it when some one else's ugly toddler wanders through my child's cover-shot worthy portrait amidst the tulips, the sheer joy my child brings to the world offsets whatever minor inconvenience it causes you, the tulip farmer, and all the rest of the people who come to the tulip festival.

"This whole thing to me is asinine. People who go to smoking lounges or clubs know exactly what they're doing and are going there voluntarily to smoke. For there not to be an exception in the law that allows for such lounges is ridiculous. And putting so many requirements on them such as ""operate strictly as a private club, with a secured entrance, no advertising, no alcohol, no more than 2,500 members and no paid employees"" seems to simply be rules catered to shutter the business, but they can still say ""hey we gave them options"". 

Membership as defined in the settlement: ""Membership is limited to individuals at least 18 years of age. A potential member must be referred by a current member and submit a written application signed by the applicant. Defendant must verify the applicant's name and age through photo identification provided at the time of application. Membership may not start until at least 24 hours following a completed application. A membership fee shall be required and shall be collected at least every quarter.

"Yes.  

The Panama Papers is going to be a fertile source of outrage in that some of the dealings divulged from them will be illegal.  People using shell corporations to hid assets for some nefarious purpose or another.  Hiding assets from legal settlements or divorce proceedings, for instance.  Or the ever popular straight up illegal tax evasion.

The pissiness that this article is about...and which House committees and Parliamentary investigations love to get people even pissier about...is min/maxing the tax code legally.  Taxes on assets and incomes that cross national jurisdictions is really, really complicated.  So there are lots of rules.  Rules spawn rules lawyers, who then proceed to act in their clients best interests and get them the best deals they can.

This pisses people off.  It pisses people off because most of us would like to be rich but never will be.  So we've got that jealousy thing going on with Microsoft millionaires, and more and more with Amazon people.  And it pisses us of because it feel like people aren't paying ""their fair share.""  Not so different from how people get pissy about ""the welfare queen"" faux stereotype.

It really comes down to this in my opinion: do you own a home?  Did you take the tax credit for your mortgage?  How about that fat sales tax examption you're entitled to on your federal return because we don't have a state income tax and our sales tax is a whopping 9.5% in Seattle?  Did you take that?

"I will preface this with, I am a cop. Not SPD, but nearby. I've posted similar responses on other articles on this subreddit:

Property crime, particularly vehicle prowl, is going to continue to get worse in the greater Seattle area until we change the legal and judicial response to it. For year we have allowed the system to bceome more and more forgiving, accepting the idea that ""non-violent crime"" should be dealt with very lightly. It doesn't work, it simply creates an environment where criminals commit crime without any fear of consequence.

Take a minute and read the RCW for Vehicle Prowl-2 :

http://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9A.52.100

Of importance here, is that the fact once someone is convicted of vehicle prowl twice, the third arrest and potential conviction is suppose to be a Felony.

The KCPAO is refusing to file them as felony charges. They do not care that state law says they are suppose to, they simply will not. This is due to a combination of problems. For starters, they are criminally underfunded and understaffed. This is the biggest issue. Combine that with the fact that the KCP is an elected official who has two major concerns; conviction rate, and making sure his office does not appear to charge minorities disproportionately, and you have a system that allows criminals to receive sentencing that is below state-mandated minimums and be given plea bargains that in no way meet the state standard for criminal law.

As a result, it doesn't even matter if your local Law Enforcement agency had the funding and man power to catch the prowlers, as 95% of them are PR'ed (no bail) the next morning, won't have a court date for over a month, and if it ever even occurs, they will be given time served and a suspended sentence.

"and there's little will to prosecute...

http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/bus-driver-wonrsquot-be-charged-in-fatal-kirkland-crash/
&gt;Prosecutors said there is insufficient evidence to file vehicular-homicide charges against Aleksandr Rukhlin, 56, who drove a Sound Transit bus through a red light and collided with a Ford Escape, killing Robert and Elizabeth Rotta and injuring their son, Kendall Rotta, on May 6, 2013.

&gt;The Prosecutor’s Office said Rukhlin’s driving was “certainly negligent,” but the state could not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he “consciously disregarded a dangerous situation.” A review suggested he accidentally stepped on the gas pedal instead of the brake, but the reasons for his driving through a red light remain uncertain, the Prosecutor’s Office said, and there is no evidence he deliberately attempted to run the light. 

&gt;The case was also submitted for review of a possible felony hit-and-run charge, as **the bus did not stop for nearly three-fourths of a mile after the collision,** according to the Prosecutor’s Office. There is no evidence that Rukhlin was attempting to flee from the scene, so hit-and-run charges can’t be filed.

&gt;The case will be forwarded to the King County District Court for **possible filing of traffic infractions.**

http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/sound-transit-bus-driver-may-face-charges-in-2013-fatal-crash/
&gt;According to state law, a driver doesn’t necessarily have to be intoxicated, or even reckless, to be charged with vehicular homicide, but merely to drive “with disregard for the safety of others” in a fatal crash.

"I live on this route at Kirkwood Place in Tangletown.  Kirkwood is not a major arterial, and residents are regularly getting their mirrors removed by the bus.  

Our neighborhood has attempted to get this route moved three streets over onto Kenwood, which is a wide Street, but the city of Seattle does not want the added expense of adding bus stops to Greenlake Way.  

I've lived here for three years, and never had an issue until this frequency change.  The large diesel buses have a 15 mph max limit in the neighborhood which is regularly ignored.  The noise of these buses accelerating up the hill makes it impossible to sleep with the windows open.  

Twice in the past few weeks  two buses have gotten stuck trying to simultaneously take the corner at Kirkwood and 56th.  In both cases the bus drivers went door to door trying to find car owners to get their legally parked cars to move so the buses could get unstuck.  In both cases the roads were blocked, passengers were stranded, and police came to block traffic and assist the drivers in reversing across 56th.

While some complaints are redicilous, the increased frequency is certain to inconvenience a lot of residents legitimately.

Edit:  It is worth noting that the reason the frequency of this route has increased so dramatically is because it makes up for the elimination of route 16.  So it isn't increased bus service at all, but a consolidation which hurt bus service for others.",,,,Relyt81,,,1461560232,t5_2qhad,t3_4garmb,t1_d2g1er6,76,1463671611,0,0,d2g7jcv,Seattle,76,,

"I have ~3 years of food spending data on hand for me and my wife. [Here's the graph](http://imgur.com/NceDUQt). I overlayed a 6 month moving average on there too.

Over that time period that averages to: 

* 465.96 $ (groceries)
* 188.93 $ (restaurants)
* 654.90 $ (combined). 

Some of the median values are a little lower: 

* 474.41 $ (groceries)
* 174.51 $ (restaurants)
* 635.47 $ (combined). 

The grocery store breakdown during that time is 

* Albertsons: 134 visits, ~3500 $
* Safeway: 86 visits, ~4900 $
* QFC: 33 visits, $ 1700 $
* Met Market: 13 visits, ~300 $
* Cash and Carry: 9 visits, 460 $

Then a bunch of little one offs like Trader Joe's, IGA, Publix, Grocery Outlet. Albertsons is closest to where we live so we pop out there if we forget things a lot (hence the large number of visits but the relatively smaller amount).

Most of our months are pretty consistent unless we have family visiting or we are traveling (on the spending graph that one very large restaurants spike was a long vacation).

Edit:

We use YNAB to track out spending and my wife and I (mostly her) use [PepperPlate](https://www.pepperplate.com/)to plan our meals.

"Hey there.  I'm finishing up a Master's in Teaching at a university in Seattle and am currently looking for positions in the Seattle area.  I'm dual endorsed in ELA and social studies, so I can perhaps give a little insight.

First and foremost, most of the seattle districts have electronic application systems, so I'd reccomend looking for portals to those on the district websites.  Off the top of my head, the major school districts close to the city proper are Seattle, Shoreline (North), Mercer Island (east), Bellevue (east) and Highline (south).  As you go further out, you run into Federal Way, Issaquah, Tukwila, and a whole host of others.  I'd suggest poking around Wikipedia to see where they are located and where you are interested in living.

Right now, we're in a bit of a waiting game for humanities positions.  Lots of openings aren't going to be posted on aforementioned online portals until May/June.  It's even possible that a lot of those openings won't be filled til August, so bear that in mind.  Seattle Public Schools are very competitive for jobs, so much that even experienced teachers may need to come in at a .6 or .8 and wait for a 1.0 FTE to open up.  You'll be going against a number of experienced teachers who are trying to move into Seattle proper from the surrounding areas, so keep that in mind.  The south and north ends of the city seem to have more openings going around.

Do you have a master's degree?  Your experience might make up for a lack of it, but be prepared for the less than 1 FTE if you don't.  Almost impossible for a new hire to get picked up without one, especially in the city/humanities.  My cooperating English teacher had a Master's in English, as did several other faculty in the department.

What sort of school are you hoping to work at?  If you have experience in diverse and urban schools, you're going to have a lot better luck.  I interned at a predominantly white school in the city, and as a result have been told in preliminary interviews that I don't have the type of experience that some of the districts are looking for.  The affluent schools and districts will be hard to get into.  My school had 1 opening in the entire LA/Social studies departments combined, and said opening already had someone headhunted for it.  If you want a more urban school and have experience there, I'd suggest looking into Highline, Federal Way, or even down in Kent.  Those districts serve a more consistently diverse population and are hungry for experienced urban teachers.  

Final note, if you have experience with it, be prepared to play up standards-based grading in your arsenal.  That's gotten me a bit of traction, with some of the more diverse schools using it as a departmental standard in LA.

"Born here and I completely relate.  While Boeing and Microsoft employed the city, it seemed to pass those jobs mostly to locals at the time.  The driving force in my mind has always been the hard working nerds.  Socially awkward, extremely technical, always looking for a better way to do things.  The Asian and Native American influence stood out more and the few people who migrated here were artists, nature lovers, and gays escaping discrimination.  We still have all of those arch types as a foundation but the melting pot has grown and nerd population grew exponentially while attracting big city types.  I've accepted defeat and been pushed into the commuter suburbs.  Like many I hated on the great California migration but a few years ago I decided I need to live in the now and accept that everything can and will change and embrace the good a big city feel gives us.

"Hello, I'm sorry to hear that you've been having a bad time.  I am a Seattle native, over the age of 50, and over the years I have had many co-workers who moved here from other places complain about how hard it is to make friends.  With many of those people, I observed behaviors that just don't work that well in Seattle.  They work great other places, just not here.

Whenever you are in a new place where you don't know anyone, the loneliness can be crushing.  Recognize that you are in a temporary situation. Hating your life ""and all the moments leading up to"" this is, well, unnecessary.

There is a saying, ""the map is not the landscape.""  It means you can never truly know what a place is like until you are actually there.  You had a dream of a perfect and wonderful place and what your life would be like here.  Now you are here, and must set about discovering what kind of life you can make from your own actions, attitude, and will.  

I doubt very much that you were the only person in Seattle crying from loneliness that day.  There was probably another person doing the same thing just blocks away from you, in their own apartment... because that's what people are like.  We struggle, we feel alone, we hurt, we withdraw.  We also connect, feel joy, and celebrate.  It's all part of life.

If you don't like your life here, you can change it.  You have the power to do so.  Yes, you do.  It might take time, it might be discouraging, it might involve more tears...  but you can do it.  You moved all the way across the country.  You excel in your skills.  You are capable and powerful and brave.

Don't give up.  Give yourself more time, and give the people who will love you time to find you.  We move slowly here in Seattle.  We watch you for a long time before we reach out.  We are shy and awkward, and we need some patience.  But once we become friends, we stay.  Give it more time, and while you are trying, remember to be your own best friend.  Even people with great social strengths are not happy all the time.   Love yourself for who you are and the skills you have - and if you want to start learning more social skills, take a step or two toward it.  Join a group.

First paragraph is offensive and blaming the person trying to help. The second paragraph is also offensive by being unnecessarily hostile to someone just trying to help. This should be enough for anyone to realize that people who brag about their travels are arrogant, unfriendly and downright rude. Chances are they also trying to push their poor attitude on you, but that's a topic for another day. 

I am still waiting to read your own opinion about what the OP should do beyond ""people from Seattle are the worst."" Such a nice comment BTW, blaming the person who's actually trying to help for every bad thing that happened to you while you lived here and trying to make them feel bad for their earnest words of support. 

Also great advice on what the person who wrote this should do next. Recognize Seattle is awful. Accept if that's where you're from, anything you say is bad. Stop trying to help unless you're prepared to be indicted for every rude thing someone from Seattle has ever done and answer to this large chip on my shoulder.

"I never know whether I'm getting to work in 30 minutes or 60, and it's usually worse coming home than going in. However long it takes, the ride is always uncomfortable. The convenient transfer involves a wait which may be anywhere from 5 to 20 minutes; the transfer with a 3-10 minute wait involves several flights of stairs and a few blocks' walk at each end. Add to that some bizarre confusions like the fact that the 12 is sometimes a route which goes near work and is sometimes a totally different route which doesn't go anywhere near work, because it turns south on Broadway first... I used to have that problem with the #3 coming home from a different job, where some #3s would go on a route right by my house, while other #3s went on a different route that would dump me off six or seven blocks away. 

Or the thing the other day where I watched two #10s stop simultaneously, followed by a #49 and another #10, followed two minutes later by two more #49s. A few minutes later, a #212 pulled up. Weird, I'd never seen that one before. Nobody got on.

"Probably gonna get downvoted to hell for this, but...

It was 15 years old. That doesn't sound like much, but stop and think for a moment. When the old billing system was introduced, the Playstation 2 was brand new. Windows XP had just come out. Hell, it might be able to get its learner's permit. In other words, it's old. And there's no guarantee that the old system was new even back then.

Again, it doesn't sound like a big deal. But technology has changed so much, that the old system is comparatively ancient. Supporting it has to be a nightmare, assuming the company that developed the software still even exists. And that's not even talking about the potential for security vulnerabilities present in such old software.

Besides, running an old system into the ground carries its own issues, even outside the obvious security problems. Kludges have to be developed to keep the old girl chugging. Patches are skipped, because they break critical functionality. Technical debt slowly builds up. If not properly handled, upgrading an old system that had been run into the ground can involve 2-3x as much work as if it had been done before it reached EOL.

It sucks that they ran over budget, but it sounds like it was for the right reasons (at least according to their spin, anyway).

* Beatwalk is June-October on the 2nd Sunday of the month. Worth checking out.
* If you're a carnivore, support Bob's. Bob's is the best.
* Make sure to start supporting our little local theater. The staff is great and its cool to see a little theater like that existing.
* Visit some of the smaller little strips that aren't near Rainer as well. There's a little collection around Genesee &amp; 50th and another small spot up around Wilson Ave. and Dawson towards Seward Park.
* I know some new places have opened up on MLK as well. However, I don't get over there very often.
* Hilman City is also worth checking out.

&gt; She had sour grapes over a number of people who made sure she didn’t get on this police department. She went to Tacoma. She was at least from what I know, fired from there for being dishonest. Whether that’s true or not, I don’t know, but just the mere fact that, you know, Officer Henry cut off—he heard some of these stories—and he had no further contact with her after he had this lunch date with her, and I’m assuming that’s why she filed this complaint, because she’s vindictive.

"I don't really get this mentality. I heard this a lot when the 90 closed temporarily and the world didn't end. It's a real logical fallacy to say traffic is fine when we plan a shut down of this major highway, therefore this highway isn't needed.

People will adjust their plans, work from home, make longer / circuitous commutes, take inconvenient transit options in the short term because it makes their life easier than sitting in worse traffic downtown or on I5. That doesn't at all mean the road is un-needed. It just means people are willing to adjust in the face of a well-planned, well-warned of shut down. In the long term it would be a total clusterfuck as only a relatively small percentage (maybe as high as 30%) of regular commuters have good alternate options in public transit, car pools etc. It's just way too simple a conclusion.

"As a Sanders delegate, it really was embarrassing to witness the antagonism expressed by some of my fellow Sanders supporters.

Also, look at it from the perspective of a Hillary supporter. They were already vastly outnumbered, and they might have even be feeling a bit insecure and vulnerable. So when a group of Sanders folks shouted at and disrespected them, they probably didn't see an act of passion. They probably just saw a group of petulant bullies.

"For the downtown area there's [Seattle Strength and Power](http://seattlestrength.com/). They are in an odd basement area under Walgreens but basically the only thing they have there are squat racks, deadlift platforms and benches. It's run by Todd Christensen who used to/does (?)  powerlift. You can phone them up and get a tour. It's basically impossible to get to unless you contact them before hand. The entrance is well hidden and secure. You can pay to come in or pay to be coached but it is definitely more expensive than a regular gym.

Some other gyms like [Go Total Body](http://www.gototalbody.com/club-info/location-hours/) have lame classes but also have bumper plates and squat racks (they have 2 racks, 2 platforms, and 2 flat benches) and that's a decent compromise maybe. 

I think [this place](http://www.chalkandmetalbarbellclub.com/) opened up very recently and is basically a powerlifting gym. I remember reading about them when they are about to open but their website is mostly pictures of construction and not the final product but it had potential.

"&gt;There's a middle ground between ignoring it and joining in the slapfighting.  Downvoting, reporting to moderators, or replying once to show dissent to others go a long way. 

Fully agree here, within reason.  For a long time, my desire to have there be at least some non-asshole responses kept me subbed to /worldnews.  I felt like someone had to do it.

Thing is, regardless of if you think it does, it wears on you.  You start seeing ""them"" all like that.  Day after day on /worldnews  /new slowly eats away.

And I didn't enjoy it, while the people I responded to did... It was literally all you'd see in their post history.  It's why they got up in the morning.

Fighting that with a downvote and a single rational calm non-asshole comment that doesn't keep feeding is fine.  Ranting about trump being Hitler and how anyone who disagrees is racist doesn't help, it's doing them a favor.  

&gt;Short of joining them the best thing you can do for those pushing these agendas is ignore them so they can spread their crazy unopposed.  I've been hearing just ignore it for years.  It's been tried.  It doesn't work.

Becoming the other side of it just ends up alienating the middle.

Nothing has driven people away from Sanders as fast as a minority of his most vocal supporters.  Nothing drove people away from BLM as fast as it's most vocal.  No one has caused more blowback for feminism than its most vocal.  And in each case, that minority is defended because ""with us or against us.""

"&gt; Thousands of us live in the neighborhood

There is no possible way that ""thousands"" of people are going to lose sunlight 24 hours a day because of this one building, or that thousands will be impacted by increased traffic.

&gt;No, they don't, when you build out every square foot of land. Check the plans.

Ooooh, you're right, they won't replant every single tree. Just like there used to be trees where YOUR house now stands. How guilty do you feel, knowing that you deny your neighbors additional trees?

&gt;All the people on the street below (Dewey Pl). Look at a map.

ALL of the people on the street will never ever see the sun ever again? This is just not physically possible. Even the Up! house still gets sunlight. 

&gt;After tragic flooding several years ago that killed a neighbor (and paved the way for passage of equal marriage in WA, but that's another story), infrastructure here was upgraded to control flooding. This building may nullify those measures.

wtf does this have to do with the construction? Sounds like an unrelated issue that lazy residents have been ignoring until they could use it against a new development.

&gt;No, traffic will not go elsewhere. There is nowhere else for it to go for these units. Look at a map.

Your understanding of traffic is poor.

&gt;I wasn't here when they built my house. 

Sounds like you're some NEW person coming in and RUINING the neighborhood. UGH, I hate you NEW people, you haven't lived here as long as *I* have how dare you try to change things.

"The way this works is they won't get regulatory approval until the fall of 2016, so right now nothing changes.  The leases for Airbus expire in 2019 and 2025, according to a Seattle Times article on the subject.   Alaska's spokesperson said they would explore options after the deal closes, meaning, we'll cost it out and see if it's better for us to leave Virgin's infrastructure intact right now, versus migrate to all Boeing and probably close/change over the airbus service/maint stuff they have now.  A lot also probably depends on whether Virgin runs its own maintenance or leases out.  Alaska runs it's own, so over time you'd expect they will want to be all Boeing again, though this is business so all decisions are probably up for review.  Though I doubt Alaska just having finally gotten rid of the last of their MD Deathbombs (MD-80 / MD - 88 McDonnell trash) and having one of the youngest fleets in the industry (8 years) will want to run 2 manufacturers under it's livery, but we'll see.

"Hey I know her! We went to high school together! 

Aside from having one of my baby freshman pop up on /r/Seattle, half of this advice is good, half of it is bullshit. Whenever you go to any kind of dance audition, you're supposed to look presentable (I.e. appropriate makeup), wear tight attire that shows off your physique (black is almost always recommended), and refrain from any excess jewelry. Requiring girls to wear a sports bra and low rose shorts in order to see their midsection is kinda necessary in this scenario since most of UW's cheer uniforms show off the mid section. 

The parts I find bogus are the ""natural/fake tan"", and having their hair curled and down. Yes, that's how their hair should be during a performance, but this is a try-out. It shouldn't be that hard to speculate what a girls hair will look like when its curled. Also, while appropriate make up is a must, I wouldn't say ""girl about town lipstick"" is necessary for auditions. All in all, though, the cheer/dance world is 50% talent and 50% looks. It's harsh, but that's what you're signing up for when you go to these kinds of auditions.",,,,theValeofErin,,,1461730485,t5_2qhad,t3_4gmdu8,t3_4gmdu8,102,1463718681,0,0,d2ixvri,Seattle,102,,

"Op, if a dog is an option, consider getting one. 

Not only will it be your best friend, it's a reason to go out and do things, and it will absolutely help you to meet people.

It's almost as if there was a Bluetooth pairing vulnerability/let your guard down thing with dogs - people will suspend their normal reservations when they meet a dog. 

If a dog is not an option, visit a dog park. Spending a few minutes with a bunch of dogs will uplift your spirits.

I'm sorry you're having a rough time, but it will get better. I transplanted myself a few times, so I know how it is. Having said that, avoid jumping into an intimate relationship, just out of loneliness. Tempting, but not always best.

"This is actually a pretty ignorant viewpoint - the affordable-real-estate office parks of the eastside have been fertile grounds for microbreweries for nearly thirty years now, long before they were trendy.

Between Bellevue and neighboring Redmond and Woodinville, there are a number of excellent choices (not a comprehensive list, just my favorites):

- Black Raven (Redmond)
- Postdoc (Redmond)
- Geaux Brewing (Bellevue)
- Bellevue Brewing (Bellevue)
- Hi-Fi (Redmond)
- Dirty Bucket (Woodinville)
- Red Hook (Woodinville - okay, so they aren't really a microbrewery anymore, but they do offer an excellent restaurant experience...)

Of these, I'd recommend Black Raven - they don't serve food, but they have one of the best tasting room experiences and their beer is widely acclaimed.  I also really like Postdoc - a newer mom-and-pop type place tucked in a tiny corner near Marymoor Park, which is an attraction in and of itself (particularly in the summer when it hosts outdoor concerts).  

Bellevue Brewing is pretty mediocre - both the food and the beer.  If you want something closer to downtown bellevue, the beer and atmosphere are much better at Geaux.

If you just want a convenient pint of the classic local brew, you can't go wrong with Mac n' Jack's African Amber.  They've been brewed in Redmond since 1993, and while they don't offer a tasting experience, they do offer tours on weekends (call ahead for hours and details).  But they are on tap pretty much everywhere in the area, including all the chain-type places near Bellevue Square.

There are good breweries in Seattle too, of course - at least one in every major neighborhood.  But the ones on the eastside are at least as good in both atmosphere and quality, and honestly some of the people tucked away in nondescript office parks are using all that money they save on rent to be really innovative with their beer.

Just my $0.02.  The eastside is dominated by tech company employees, and it turns out they really like beer...  it's definitely the best place to set up shop for brewers and there's a serious scene over there that the Seattle hipsters barely know exists.",,,,mofang,,,1459493753,t5_2qhad,t3_4ctwjp,t1_d1lhkth,14,1463144195,0,0,d1liqzc,Seattle,14,,
"My understanding is that Microsoft outsources certain functions to other companies (for instance, some marketing positions). It's contractual and typically for a short period of time.

Plus, if the economy takes a dive, Microsoft doesn't have to lay off its full-time work force; they simply don't renew the contracts. Pretty common with large companies.

All of the cars are better than Smartcars, but I'm sure I'll keep using both services just based on what's available.

For ours, it seems there may have been at least one delegate misallocation resulting in net gain in county delegates for Clinton. This despite the party's new rule change that was supposed to ensure the delegate counts essentially remain the same.

Unfortunately, at each point where there was some obvious fuckery going on, reasonable, articulate Sanders supporters were overshadowed by a select few nutjob Sanders supporters screaming and going overboard, essentially causing the speaker to be more defensive than before, and further refuse to cooperate. Granted, I don't think their intent was for transparency and thoroughness in the first place. But the crazies essentially turned every legitimate issue into one where nobody wanted to be on the same side as ""that guy"". Plus they were just adding frustration to a frustrating process.

"&gt; The engineers did anticipate future traffic levels, but in 1972 the voters in Seattle voted to kill the projects.

This doesn't surprise me. Seattleites have been opposed to intelligent planning for well over half a century. It is as if the local political culture can't grasp the utility of planning infrastructure:


For almost 50 years now, Seattleites have [voted down](http://seattlish.com/post/83663717975/on-blast-90-years-of-fucked-up-seattle-public) most any efforts to make modern, functional, forwarding thinking programs to create transit and better transit infrastructure. 

* In 1968, voters approved the Kingdome, but rejected transit  

* In [1970](http://www.seattletimes.com/business/economy/the-mass-transit-system-seattle-might-have-had-jon-talton/), voters rejected four transit-related bonds, causing the federal government to reroute transit aid to Atlanta instead of here.  

* In [1972](http://metro.kingcounty.gov/am/history/history-1970.html) voters allow a small transit tax for busses, but reject the tax for electric rail. (Even the meager vote for busses was the first time Seattleites approved new taxes for transit since 1918)  

* In [1995](http://metro.kingcounty.gov/am/history/history-1990.html), voters reject a Regional Transit Authority (later Sound Transit) measure for a gigantic, $6.7 billion transportation system over three counties that would’ve featured commuter rail, light rail, express buses, and expanded HOV lanes 

* In 1999, with Initiative 695, local voters show their love of Tim Eyman and regressivism- scrapping the progressive car excise fee for a super-regressive $30 state car tabs. Since 29% of the vehicle excise tax went to local transit, local communities have been scrambling to keep their buses running ever since. 

* In 2002, voters showed their hatred of forward-thinking transit/infrastructure funding and support an Eyman initiative yet again: voters approved I-776,which restricted local governments from adding their own excise taxes and limited local license tab fees. While the measure was shot down at first for being unconstitutional, it was upheld by the State Supreme Court in October 2003. 776 repealed many taxes that the public had [already voted on](https://researchcouncil.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/initiative776.pdf)  

* In [2005](http://www.seattlepi.com/local/transportation/article/Monorail-will-go-to-voters-for-5th-time-1183631.php), Mayor Nickels gets the ""all-or-nothing"" plan for a West Seattle-Ballard monorail on the ballot. The plan is a watered down, poor version of the original, so it failed. Its rejection gutted Seattle Monorail Partners, which had been working to upgrade our transit system since they were created by a public vote in 1997. Council President Jan Drago (accurately) expressed fear that not building the monorail segment means ""we will pass it to future generations."" **Now look where we are!** 

* In [2011](http://seattlest.com/2011/07/13/last_night_people_are_voting_with_t.php): The Congestion Reduction Fee. When our regressive and outdated sales tax revenue plummets during the recession – the King County Council approves a $20 fee on vehicle tabs to make up the $60 million deficit, collected in 2012  through 2014  

* In [2014](http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/with-transit-money-approved-seattle-pledges-to-spend-new-dollars-well/), Seattleites vote *FOR* maintaining some bus transit, with more regressive taxes - a $60 car-tab fee and a 0.1 percent sales-tax increase - to keep many bus lines from being cut and to expand services on a couple bus lines.

"It's a lot more about wealth than it is any other individual factor. Caucuses require a large investment of time, and free time is usually something that only relatively wealthy people have. Many poor people are working two or three jobs in order to just make rent, and they can't afford to take a day to caucus. Many people will bring up the absentee forms, but for many hourly workers, they don't know their schedules ahead of time, and the deadline for those forms was before many of those workers would have gotten their schedules.

So take that and layer it with the decades of mistreatment that have resulted in African Americans being disproportionately poor, and you arrive at an implicit depression of African American votes by caucuses. You will also find similar depression for single parents, the vast majority of whom are single moms.

You can also find other invisible costs to caucus such as getting there, the need to for your kids to be taken care of (and then the sitter isn't caucusing), something to eat while you listen to random people drone on, and so forth.

It ends up creating a VERY strong disincentive to caucus. The turnout for the WA caucus was &lt;6% while mail-in primaries tend to be ~40%. There is a reason for that.",,,,Cadoc7,Westlake,,1459616764,t5_2qhad,t3_4d25rf,t3_4d25rf,30,1463171815,0,0,d1n4kg0,Seattle,30,,flair

"What he means is that the intensity of the job has become more.

Minimum wage did not change the store revenue. Let's say it was a $1m in sales, at the 18% profit margin. You end up with $180k of gross profit.

$30k rent/utilities, so you are left with $150k in profits/wages. Let's say the owner retains $50k in profit. If you pay $9/hr (fully burdened cost $10.50), you can afford 4 people plus some part time. If you pay $15 (fully burdened cost $17.25), you can hire 3 people, but the amount of work is still the same - so the people have to work a lot harder.

Fact is, there are lots of reasons why one might be unhappy with Ike's (I can expand on this if asked but I'm not going to belabor the points right now), but it's hard to apply a label to the kind of discontent that's arisen.  The protesters are using the term 'anti-gentrifier', which makes it easy to dismiss them as misguided... on the other hand, I can't think of a term that would unite the protesters as effectively.

does the traffic upset you? not as much as riding the bus for 3 hours.

are you too important for mass transit? better answered: mass transit is not easy for me to use, and does not save time for me for my commute. the exact opposite is true, it would take me hours longer.

"I'll answer. I grew up in Seattle in the 1970's, and was bused from Ballard, where we lived, to Leschi so I could help integrate the schools in that neighborhood. My mom, as a hippie, initially approved of this plan. She thought it would help the kids at Leschi. 

Nope. The white kids from Ballard and Sunset Hill and Greenwood were placed in honors classes after it was discovered that we all tested way above the poorer neighborhood kids' reading and math levels. We had exactly one black kid in my class, yet at recess, we were surrounded by black kids. I never got to know any of them. We segregated ourselves at lunch and recess too. 

I knew none of the kids in my neighborhood. Summer was hell. There were no kids my age in the block or two I knew well, and I never got to meet any of the kids who did attend the local school. I had no friends within walking/biking distance. We were scattered all over the area. Because my mom was a working single mother, I couldn't do any after school activities unless there was another bus to take me home. No sports. No plays. No music. I went home and sat in front of the TV. 

Eventually, we moved to Enumclaw. Suddenly, I had friends from school! It was amazing. I knew every kid in my neighborhood and we played together all summer long. I could walk home, so I could do after school stuff. It was soooo much better. I slept later, got home sooner, and had real friends nearby who were my own age. 

Neighborhood schools are the best. My mother went from writing an op-ed for the Times in favor of bussing to hating it with a passion. Kids should be able to walk to school whenever possible. It's healthier, builds independence, takes the pressure off working families, builds better school involvement, and gives kids a chance to get to know nearby friends. Teachers see the families they serve at the local grocery stores, or if they can't live in that neighborhood themselves, they can at least get to know that neighborhood's concerns. Districts can't ignore the needs of poor kids by adding in segregated classes of higher performing kids. It's just a win-win for everyone. 

If we really want to address racial segregation in this city, we can do it without burdening our kids. ",,,,mittenthemagnificent,,,1460639452,t5_2qhad,t3_4eofbj,t1_d21ycyt,14,1463436116,0,0,d22ibji,Seattle,14,,

"I got there at 10:00am and everything seemed to be great - was maybe the 5th shuttle to the bridge from UW - had a nice time walking to the eastside and back but then, holy god the clusterfuck...

I got in line on the westside shuttle stop (which would maybe be a ten minute walk on a CLOSED BRIDGE to get to the UW light rail station) at 12:57, got on a ""UW-bound"" bus at 1:47, and didn't get back to the UW until 2:50. Why did it take an hour to go less than a mile? Because they sent the packed-full bus all the way to the traffic disaster that was the Kirkland park and ride, where we drove past lines of frustrated people, through the stop on the east highrise, where we had to wait again behind other shuttles, then back through the westside stop, where we had to wait again behind other shuttles... Nobody got on or off at any of these stops. The bus was intentionally packed full of people going to UW.

People on the bus were PISSED. I was too, obviously, but man that was one seriously awkward and uncomfortable bus ride. I feel real bad for the families with (understandably) frustrated and screaming children.

"Functionally, it is no different than riding an old 7 from John and Broadway used to be, back when those buses continued from Capitol Hill through all of downtown and on into the ID and Rainier Valley.

The new street car is very slow, 27 minutes or so end-end.  Riding the Link from Broadway and John to the ID will be a lot faster on most trips.

There's always the politics of nice middle class kids will ride streetcars but won't ride buses, but I never quite bought that argument for Capitol Hill - we've been packing buses around here for decades, only to have services be cut by the suburbs-focused modern-day Metro.  The old 7, 9, 60 and 14 were all very popular routes until modern Metro fucked all of them up, reduced service times, then split the routes in half to make the 49 only go to Pike, requiring a transfer.

Some day in the distant future they may just figure out a way to close Broadway Ave to all traffic but trolleys, buses and bikes .. then speeds could increase and it would make more sense as transport.  

Or we could have put the N/S bike lane a block off of Broadway, on Harvard or 10th or both, which would have kept Broadway lanes open, so the street car could have had its own lane.

Find a neighborhood more your speed. Try different bars. Keep going to meetups - that's how you meet people!  You can't have easy casual friends until you have acquaintances at least. Crawl, walk, run.

If you're outdoorsy join a hiking or whatever meetup and get out into the beautiful stuff we've got here.  Spend your weekends in the mountains or on the water. Does wonders for mindset.

"I've often wondered why people consider Seattle-people to be cold. For myself, the reason I probably come off as being cold is two fold: 1) I'm trying to be polite. That means no prying into people's affairs or making them uncomfortable. If I like someone I'm worried that by being too forward I'm forcing them into an uncomfortable situation, which is impolite. Ergo, taking it slow is the polite thing to do. 2) I don't value small talk. But in order to get to big talk, you have to pass through small talk. I think this is why shared activities are a good way to make friends. It cuts through the random-probing of small talk because you know that you have shared interest.

I will say this: I absolutely loath transplants who show up and bitch about stuff here. The food isn't as good as where they left. The traffic is so much worse. The weather is crappier. The people are less friendly. I don't want to hear it, because what they've done is gone into someone's home and started complaining about it. It's a jerk move. Is the Northwest perfect? Fuck no. But bitching isn't useful or endearing. If you want to talk about the lousy traffic, ask what they think about the transit initiatives in the area. If you want to talk about the food, ask about the influx of newer restaurants and bars. If you want to talk about the weather...well, good luck with that. Asking questions is how you connect with people, not passing judgement. It also leads to better conversation other than ""Ha...yeah"" or ""Uh...ok"".

"Road diets take 4-lane roads and convert them to one lane each way plus a center turn lane.

The center turn lane gets left-turning vehicles out of traffic flow, so the throughput of the one lane each direction is usually as good as the two lanes that were there before.

Having only one lane each direction also eliminates a lot of aggressive lane-changing that causes minor fender-benders, and those fender-benders cause a big chunk of congestion.

So the net impact of road diets, according to decades of research around the country before Seattle ever started doing them, is usually to reduce collisions and improve traffic flow while shaving off the fastest speeders -- instead of slowing down all traffic on the street, it chops the tail off the curve but leaves average speeds about the same.

BUT, if you turn 4 lanes into 3, the outside lanes are often so wide that those aggressive drivers, denied a separate lane to pass in, will zip by on the right, within the same lane.  So engineers look for ways to use up that extra space -- parking, planters, wider sidewalks, bus stop pull-outs, or, cheapest of all, a stripe of white paint and some bike symbols.  They aren't really there for the bikes, they're there to keep drivers out.

"Everything you're describing as - if I may paraphrase - as human nature is actually a lot more complicated than market forces or making money.

Start with girls being told by society and their brothers that they shouldn't like video games. (Or that they're bad at math, or programming, or anything.)

Start with a society that only really markets video games to boys to begin with.

Also start with a society that gives more economic freedom and reward, leisure time and less expectations of home labor like doing laundry to boys and men even if the wife or woman is also working to pay the bills.

Mix in the fact that most companies - including game companies - are dominated by men. As well as investment firms.

Now extend all of this across not just video games, but movies and books in general where the vast majority of characters whether heroes or villains and basically everything is written and framed around boys/men.

Now end this argument with the bullshit you just said by calling women ""crazed 3rd or 4th wave feminists"" and ""forcing people to like"" anything at all?

Who the fuck is forcing whom to enjoy something, here, really? 

No, really?

Unless you're playing Rust, no one is fucking forcing anyone to play as a woman when the default lead character of almost every video game (book, or movie) out there is male?

And no one is forcing anyone to play rust or consume any video game at all.

Asking why there isn't equal representation for half of the fucking planet when 99.9999% of all video games are male-focused or charactered isn't forcing anyone to do jack fucking shit but consider why half of the fucking planet is effectively basically missing from video games and fiction of all kinds unless they're side characters or sex objects.

And ultimately - why would it make you unhappy to be forced to play a video game as a female character?

And why is it ok that women have to play as a male character?

That's really kind of fucked up, and ""that's just the way it is"" is a really weak bullshit argument.

"That's overly cynical, overly detached from the personal stake of community members, and overly generalizes the distinct groups involved. 

You refer to Native Americans generally as a ""they"" *twice*, whereas you can't really lump-in Tribal Governments, communities, individuals, and other factions as a monolithic ""they."" Some benefits, concerns, and interests are really exclusive to those respective parts. It's *entirely possible* to discuss Kennewick Man and ICWA without mentioning, or even thinking about, Sovereignty.

People are perfectly capable of caring about the respect for their ancestor's remains through NAGPRA enforcement and the *individual, community, tribal, and family* interests served by IGRA. Bringing in the separate issue of children/adoption makes this current discussion *extraordinarily* messy, personal, and political because you're talking about peoples *family and kids*; much more intense than Kennewick Man's bones.

""Almighty Sovereignty"" and Tribal Governmental posturing are tertiary concerns compared to the prospect of remains being desecrated or Native children being stolen and/or sold. We're not fans of grave-robbing or being the involuntary subjects of science, to be put on display. *That's* where these issues live among the ""monolithic they"" you identify.

If there's an actual empathy gap, because it's easy to just shoulder these burdens on an overly generalized ""other,"" consider what it would be like if any of these issues actually pertained to your immediate family to get a sense of an individual's stake in the outcome. Now multiply that impact for the community stake in the outcome. The Tribal Government, by comparison, may or may not actually care, depending on how responsive they are, but then, they might also care about something that their constituents and constituent communities do not. 

This is all without getting to the idea of ""reminding everyone"" about anything. We probably should be more mindful of the PR aspects of ICWA in particular, but because it touches on such a *fundamental* area of being, the Native people affected tend to forget that it's ""all just a show"" to outsiders who have no skin in the game.",,,,Opechan,,,1461814639,t5_2qhad,t3_4gq3lo,t1_d2k8821,10,1463741597,0,0,d2k9pn0,Seattle,10,,
"From sound transit's website, there's a sales tax component:

http://m.soundtransit.org/node/10188

Local revenues sources

With existing regional taxes committed to completing and operating regional transit projects that voters approved in 1996 and 2008, the majority of ST3 funding will come from the recently approved new sources: 

Property tax of up to 25 cents for each $1,000 of assessed valuation ($75 annually for a $300,000 house). A property tax was identified as a way to establish a more progressive revenue source for regional transit investments that reduces reliance on the sales tax.

​Sales tax of up to an additional 0.5 percent ($0.50 on a $100 purchase) in addition to the 0.9 percent currently collected.

"To the /r/Seattle community:

Removing the previous post was my call. I'm posting the reasons I provided to /u/TheTim below and will gladly take all criticism and feedback you want to provide about my decision.

TL;DR; Political discussion is absolutely allowed in /r/Seattle. The problem was solely with the non-neutral nature of the title.

-----

First, per the rules of [reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette):

&gt; **Keep your submission titles factual and opinion free.** If it is an outrageous topic, share your crazy outrage in the comment section.

Second, to expand on how the reddiquite rule specifically pertained to his post.

1. The post took a neutral news article and changed the title for your post to be non-neutral. (Note: this actually wasn't fixed in this repost, but I'm allowing it so that we can have this discussion).

2. The non-neutral title was a pretty clear attack on a politician for his positions. It comes across like the attack ad flyers I receive in the mail (i.e. spam).

3. We mods have been extra sensitive in keeping /r/Seattle from becoming a pro-Bernie sounding board like /r/Politics. This is despite the fact that a majority of us are Bernie supporters. In my opinion, the blame-by-association-with-Clinton game played by the OP's title is directly a pro-Bernie statement. It belongs in the comments thread, not in the post title.",,,,kcrobinson,Madrona,,1461619984,t5_2qhad,t3_4gexgs,t1_d2gxa4t,10,1463686889,0,0,d2h3bp4,Seattle,10,moderator,flair

"Flip flops are putting yourself in danger on a trail like Lake 22 which has terrain that is slippery, rocky (like literally you are climbing rocks at one point), and occasionally covered in thick tree roots. Wearing open-toed shoes makes people very likely to hurt themselves with this much stuff to bump into, and flip-flops are not generally known to have the best traction. 

Jeans... meh. They are probably fine if you are 100% certain that it's not going to rain or snow, but they are awful if you get stuck in wet weather. Perhaps synthetic yoga pants aren't significantly better, but at least they are slightly more comfortable/breathable if they get wet. 

The last time I hiked Lake 22 it was deceptively beautiful and cool at the trailhead, and snowing heavily at the top. I was prepared with layers, waterproof pants, gloves, and hand warmer packets because I read the weather report but lots of people came along in their jeans and flipflops and were NOT happy.

"This logic is fundamentally flawed. Should you be able to buy something at the store even though you can't afford it? Of course not. Transportation is not a right, and it's very true that prices are going up every year. I get a subsidized pass from my employer, but if I paid full price for something and saw other people getting that same thing for free because ""they generally don't have cash"" I'd be pretty annoyed, too. At what point does it go from petty change territory to full on theft? $5, $10? You don't get to dictate the value of something. It costs what it costs. If you want to utilize the service, pay what it costs. I don't think people should be arrested, but yes, there should be some sort of fare enforcement.

EDIT: In response to the edit above me: the point still stands. I think it's easy to dismiss it because it's ""just"" 50 cents, but say fare is $2, you'd be short 1/4th of the cost. If you went to like buy a TV, you wouldn't be able to walk out of the store without paying for a fourth of it. Again, you don't get to dictate the value of something. Just because something isn't inherently expensive doesn't mean it doesn't have value. If you can't afford it you don't get it, period. So those two or three times a year you don't have bus fare... tough. You get to walk. I don't think that's a difficult concept to grasp.

"You're getting a bunch of downvotes just for expressing your opinion, which I think is counterproductive. Your feeling that safe injection sites and other harm reduction measures encourage/condone drug use is probably the single most common stumbling block towards those programs.

Here's some long-ish posts I wrote about this a few months ago, when the topic came up on /r/news:

https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/41e2i9/drug_overdoses_are_driving_up_the_death_rate_of/cz2743e?context=1

The important shift in mindset, I think, is that the people who would visit a safe injection site aren't getting ""high"" at the government's expense. At that stage of addiction, you need to use simply to feel *normal*.

"True! I lived in Seattle for 4 years and got the worst SAD of my life every winter I was there- even the last winter when I was totally in my groove at work, had money saved, had a great group of friends, roommates and a fantastic girlfriend.  I moved back to California and SAD is hardly a factor any more.  It might start to set in around February for a while, but I'm able to live through it knowing that sunny days aren't that far off.  In Seattle it started before Christmas, because it had already been raining for two months, and wouldn't shake off until May.  Brutal.  Playing soccer year round and doing winter sports was probably the best thing I did for it.
The best advice I can give about friends is that in order to have a friend you have to be a friend.  Make the first move.  Smile at people and engage them in conversation.  Say yes to everything social or start creating your own social events.  It can be hard, but if you can make friends in Seattle, you can make them ANYWHERE.

"I used to work there for a while, and I feel as if this article is just a huge smear job that only tells part of the truth. If his name's going to be dragged through the mud, then more needs to be said about this. 

First off with the 'jokes' list, it is for anything not work-related, not necessarily just for jokes. Despite what Jessica said, you are not automatically signed up for the list, you send an email to IT and they will add you in under 3 minutes. If you want off the list, you send another email to them and they will remove you in under 3 minutes. It is really that simple. You do not get fired for stating your opinion on a subject, people argue with Peter over his beliefs all the time and it's understood to be just a disagreement politically. Nothing happens to people who disagree with him politically. In fact in the few years I worked there I only remember 3 emails in which he said similar things to whats in this article, it's not a daily or weekly occurrence like the article implies. Those times the emails do come out it makes you cringe and wonder what the hell he's thinking, but it is not at all as often the article implies.

Second, Peter treats his employees better than anywhere else I've ever worked at or seen. The amount of freedom you have when you work there is the best part. There was a time I remember hearing about where Peter wandered into a meeting on another project and started to make (stupid) suggestions on how to make this guy's part. It stopped when the person in charge of that part ended up yelling ""you don't know what you're talking about"" while chasing Peter out of the room and threw a wrench after him. Kind of an extreme example, but it shows how fucking impossible it is to get fired from EI. If you want to tell Peter to fuck off, you can do it at EI. Jessica saying she was fired for saying she wanted off an email list is complete bullshit, there has to be more to it than that. There's far more that I won't go into as to the nice things Peter does for the people working for him.

Then there's the philanthropy that Peter does, giving a very large amount of his paycheck to charities that he supports. Peter's also gotten phone calls at 8pm on a Friday from an employee he hardly knows who says he's getting married the next day at noon on the other side of the country. I mean how many CEO's would immediately buy a plane ticket and fly all night to attend that? Peter does.

There's an effort to dumb people &amp; ideas down to one or two things they have said and ignore any complexity, depth, or any good things they do and I vehemently disagree with it. Is Peter racist against muslims, yes. Is he sexist, to a much lesser degree yes. Even with that being known, is he still an overall good guy, absolutely.",,,,[deleted],,,1461959237,t5_2qhad,t3_4h03im,t3_4h03im,42,1463779628,0,0,d2mhey8,Seattle,42,,

"As a former laser hobbyist who started with helium neon tubes and diodes under 10mw (about merely twice the power of a cheap keychain red laser pointer today, less than a dvd or bluray burner) I'm kind of against hand-held 1+ watt lasers.

Because they're fucking dangerous.

One very valid use is that they can be used for star-pointing with a telescope or spotting scope.

Another use would be photographic light painting and time lapse effects.

You could easily use a large visible diode laser for film holography.

Some colors of diode lasers are very effective at underwater illumination.

Portable lasers can also be used for safety. You can signal long distances with them. You can also use almost any visible laser as a handy smoke detector, even at fairly long distances. 

They can even be used for defense. If you defocus and spread the beam and strobe it it'll dazzle the fuck out of someone trying to attack you. (This is a known military use.)

&gt; A man accused of torturing a woman to death but found too mentally ill for trial was on the loose on Thursday after crawling out a window in a locked, lower-security unit of a Washington state psychiatric hospital already facing federal scrutiny over safety problems.

&gt; Garver was moved to a lower-security unit of the state&amp;#039;s largest psychiatric hospital after a judge said mental health treatment to prepare him to face criminal charges was not working.

&gt; The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services recently extended the hospital&amp;#039;s deadline for fixing the problems from 1 April to 3 May. A federal judge also has said the hospital has failed to provide timely competency services to mentally ill people charged with crimes.

Despite an overwhelming grass roots in my legislative district, the only rep we got was one selected by the state organization, and that person was in no way representative of the delegates.

"No. There were two neighbors, the ones in the property dispute, and another neighbor (the Reeds) whom they shared a driveway with. The Reeds had sold their property back to the County recently when the County was buying up ""at risk"" properties after the Oso landslide (the properties lie directly South of the slide). The Reeds were squatting in the house after it had sold, so Patrick and Monique had complained to the County about it. This was about two weeks ago. Then a week ago they went missing. 

Patrick and Monique were reported missing on Tuesday, but they were last seen Monday, pulling into their driveways, Monique at 1pm and her Husband at 3pm. At 4pm, when another neighbor had stopped by, both of their vehicles were already gone. The security footage that was recovered by the other neighbor (the ones in the land dispute) shows both vehicles leaving at 3am Tuesday morning. So the Reeds had taken them out or captured them right when they got home on Monday, drove them and their cars up to their property (they share a driveway), and then disposed of the cars the next morning. The bodies have not been recovered, but I assume they are nearby like the vehicles or even buried right near the Reeds house. 

Edit: my friend is a direct neighbor to the recently deceased.

"The OP speaks truth.

Right now, the water in Puget Sound near Seattle is just under 50 degrees F.  When you first fall into water that cold without cold-water protective clothing, you're likely to gasp reflexively, and start hyperventilating (which can cause you to inhale water, or to faint, and drown).  Your heart rate and blood pressure will spike (which can cause cardiac arrest).  If you survive that, within 5 - 10 minutes you'll start to lose dexterity in your hands.  You'll have trouble fastening a life jacket strap, or grasping a line.  Other muscles may start to cramp, or just refuse to do what you want them to do.  Swimming is probably no longer an option (which might be a good thing, since it makes your body temperature drop a lot faster).  You may begin having trouble keeping your airway out of the water.

After twenty or thirty minutes in the water,  hypothermia really starts setting in.  Your heart rate and breathing have slowed down considerably.  You begin to get drowsy and incoherent.  Your aren't thinking clearly anymore.  Depending on your body type, and level of fitness, and what you're wearing, you'll probably lose consciousness, or become too exhausted to keep your head out of the water, after roughly an hour of being immersed.  Even if you're wearing a flotation device, after 3-4 hours, its main benefit will probably be to keep your body afloat so it's easier to recover.  You've most likely drowned, but if not, hypothermia got you.

Sure, there have been those weird cases of people falling into cold water, without any survival gear, and surviving for hours longer than there's any good reason they should have.

Correct.

They have repeatedly been shown to have a catalytic effect on infill development, stimulating high-density construction within a quarter-mile (5 minute walk) of the tracks.  The high capacity corridors where they are planned are also, not coincidentally, high growth corridors.

"I know how you feel - I sometimes find myself wondering why 'living life' takes so much damn WORK. It seems like it should be effortless, something that just sort of...happens. But as I get older I have come to realize that it DOES take work, and more than that it takes intention. Even with my greatest friends, I have to be purposeful in my connecting with them, intentional in my solicitations for time to spend together, and patient in all our interactions.

In that in-between time, I've learned to slow down a bit and to be selfish. Most of my free time is spent doing the things that I enjoy, even if that means I do them solo.

Hang in there - what you need is TIME to settle in and explore. My only piece of advice for you - which I wish someone had given me when I was in your position living in Chicago a few years ago - don't make an emotional decision. You may feel like you want to quit your job and move back to the East Coast and put all this behind you...and I'm not saying you can't do that.

Even small things like getting together with friends can turn into a ridiculous amount of planning and such because of the various schedules involved.

Spend 5 minutes with your eyes closed, listening to the birds in the morning.  Read a book in the park.  Take a walk around Greenlake.  Go see a movie in the park when they're running.

Southwest is great about this, honestly, which is why I put in the extra effort to thank them.

Its my perception, that while there are obviously racial, as well as religious, socio economic and educational conflicts and divisions in this country- the myriad numbers of articles, forums and conferences bemoaning the numbers of white rich guys, seems to paralyze our culture from actually moving into the 21st century.
You could feel guilty, or you could feel like a victim, then you can either move on and get some work done in spite of that, or you can spend your life showing others how they can feel guilty/victims.

Why is it that Japanese Americans, for instance, don't seem to have the baggage of feeling like they don't belong, even though 74 years ago, between 110,000 and 130,000 were forcibly removed from their homes on the west coast, without many of their belongings, treated like criminals and traitors and made to live in camps for four years.
Most were nisei, second generation American born Japanese with US citizenship.

I think a lot of times we see what we look for, and we love controversy, so articles like this are very validating even though divisive., ",,,,MrsWhatsit-75,,,1460241354,t5_2qhad,t3_4e3030,t3_4e3030,22,1463335085,0,0,d1wmxps,Seattle,22,,
"Good morning. In less than an hour, Ballard diners from here will join others from around the world. And you will be launching the largest shard battle in this history of mankind.

Mankind -- that word should have new meaning for all of us today.

We can't be consumed by our petty differences anymore.

We will be united in our common interests.

Perhaps its fate that today is the 23rd of April, and you will once again be fighting for our freedom, not from tyranny, oppression, or persecution -- but from annihilation.

We're fighting for our right to live, to exist.

And should we win the day, the 23rd of April will no longer be known as an American holiday, but as the day when the world declared in one voice:

"I've said the exact same thing! 

Yes recruiters don't directly work on that, but I guarantee you the reason a candidate declines to interview is logged and discussed at length. It's a big deal for a company to get ""DTI""d (declined to interview), it's often a metric on a recruiter's score card. At my company a DTI that a recruiter can't control wouldn't be counted against them, but there are very regular meetings where the recruiters discuss all the reasons for DTI and rejecting and offer, and often leadership will go out and work to change them. We upped our pay package and improved our placement process because of those meetings. Our CEO gets at least yearly updates on the highlights of those meetings.

"It's mostly aesthetic and political. Streetcars are ""en vogue"" in American politics at the moment, although they've been a known technology for more than a century, and many cities (including ours) ripped out their well-developed systems starting in the 40s when we thought the car was the answer to everything. There's nothing inherent about a streetcar that limits its functionality, it's just that American implementations often do nothing to allow them priority or anything like that, so you basically have a really expensive bus line that has little or no benefits over a traditional bus. If our lines were given their own dedicated lanes and signal priority, they would be much faster. The City Center Connector should have both those things, but we'll see if they're watered down by the time the thing is built. Either way, it'll be crippled on both sides if they don't do anything about the current alignments.

"Yeah it was kind of a shitshow. There was a 45 minute or so presentation from elected officials and Metro and Sound Transit staff with just 15 minutes for questions. They were clear they were only taking questions and not comments. It ended pretty abruptly at 7pm in the midst of a guy who wanted to yell about how expensive it was and the rest of the crowd booing him. The few questions allowed were about the 22-year timeline, cost and opportunity for Ballard-UW. All were given non-answers or were some variation of ""well we like to deliberate in the Northwest and so it takes a while."" I was particularly irked by CM Rob Johnson saying Ballard and Seattle are part of a region and we have to wait our turn for our project. He said ""what's the difference between 19 and 22 years?"" 3 years, Rob. How about you advocate for your constituents (Seattlites) and not for Federal Way?

My impression going in was that:

1) this was an open house for Sound Transit so spending 20+ minutes on the King County Metro Long Range Plan was frustrating; and

2) the purpose of the meeting was community feedback on the ST3 draft plan. It's clear it wasn't. They just directed us to take the online survey (which I, and presumably many people there, already did).

"Utah-- the state of Utah-- has, according to the numbers I've seen in articles about their homeless-housing efforts, fewer homeless people than King County.  That should not be a surprise when their state population is less than half of Washington's, or that their major city, SLC, has less than a third of Seattle's population. 
Utah can house people anywhere it wants in the entire state and can find and buy cheap land to do so. What cheap land do you expect the City of Seattle to find within its city limits, for building this housing?  

Just because Utah, a low-population, low cost-of-living state can do something; it does not mean that program could in any way scale down to the city level, or up to the size of Seattle's homeless population.

"Are you insane? Seattle wants transit so badly we tried tried to build ourselves a monorail after we got sick of waiting for Sound Transit and its light-rail monopoly to crawl up the Rainier Valley.

But I just really wonder of this is the best thing for the UW to focus on when there are other glaring issues that are seemingly being ignored.

At least a third of these students are out-of-state/international and are paying absurd tuition prices. Not to mention that the campus is generally always over crowded during school hours, which is probably going to get worse. I had a professor not too recently point out how large his class had gotten from last year and how he feared that it would affect his class, given that it is a discussion heavy course.

"Bullshit.  Reagan caused the Mental Health Systems Act to end, which funded all kinds of hospitals.  He started defunding mental health in California when Reagan was governor, and he continued to defund mental health at the federal level when he was elected president.   There is tons of information about this, and for you to claim Reagan's horrible economic policies about mental health and the health of the nation in general had nothing to do with this is disingenuous but quite typical of the republican party.

"I've seen first hand some of the problems with what they're doing. Hell just singling them out in the line reinforces the square-peg-round-hole mindset.

I had multiple female college hires confide in me that they were afraid they were only at the company because they were tokens. That they weren't smart enough to do the job, but had gotten it anyways because of their gender. These girls were more than capable of doing the job but the knowledge that females got special treatment fueled their impostor syndrome. It undermined any self worth they could gain from landing such a sought-after position, and really hurt their confidence on the job- which will itself negatively impact job performance. When I was hired after my internship I remember thinking ""finally, evidence that I'm not a moron just here by accident!"" These women didn't get to experience that.

I've also heard stories of (but not experienced first-hand) ridiculously incompetent developers not being let go because of management's desire to maintain gender balance. True net-negatives being kept around while teammates that are productive, but underperforming, get put on ""performance improvement plans,"" and then kicked out the door a few months later. This not only harms the team's morale and productivity, it deprives the person being used as a token from building a career in something they are good at.

"Did anyone catch that fuckhead republican from Ellensburg on NPR yesterday arguing against light rail, when he isn't even going to pay for it or use it?

That is the reason we can't have nice things. We have a group in this state that is committed to ruining it for people that actually want nice things, and they don't even care that they will never be taxed or have to pay a single cent for it.

We need to split off eastern Washington, at least until the light rail is done. Then we can examine the whole reunification process and see if we need them or not.

"I followed the link, and provided the following:

I’m confused. I was a delegate at the 48th, and, to the best of my knowledge, Bernie alternates were still available. How did the final delegate count work out to…

1st CD: Sanders 11, Clinton 5

9th CD: Sanders 7, Clinton 5

This makes the delegate distribution 64% Bernie to 36% Hillary.

I know the precinct caucus I attended for the 48th distributed delegates 74% Bernie (62 delegates) to 26% Hillary (22 delegates).

Additionally, I believe that the initial delegate count for the 48th legislative district was stated to be…

1st CD: Sanders 12, Clinton 4

9th CD: Sanders 8, Clinton 4

…which would be a delegate distribution of 71% Bernie to 29% Clinton.

So, I’m very confused by the final tally, and why any remaining Bernie alternates were not seated.

If you don’t happen to have answers, I would certainly appreciate it if I could be pointed in the right direction.

He laundered millions and tried to avoid paying taxes without setting off any flags. And when that didn't work he tried to pull it in relatively small amounts. 

He took money that should have gone to home owners and kept it for himself. As soon as concern was raised, he shuttered his business and cleared house.
