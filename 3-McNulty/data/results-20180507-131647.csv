"You asked about the cost of living difference - please pay attention.

You say you have a decent full time job making $10.50/hour.

Our minimum wage is $12/hour and set to rise to $15/hour over the next few years.  That should give you an indicator of how expensive it is to live here.

I have a 750 sqft one bedroom apartment in a ""cool"" neighborhood.  My apartment was built in 1954, has coin-op laundry that barely works, no air conditioning, ratty carpet, an oven that recently caught on fire, and a front door that lets in a draft because there's a 1/4'' gap between the top of the door and the wall.

This shitty apartment costs me $1615/month.

Get a better paying job before you move here, save up at least $10,000, and be prepared for some of the stiffest job and rental competition in the United States.  If you don't have a college degree, you will be at a serious disadvantage because as another poster said, Seattle is one of the most educated cities in the country and even the food service people have degrees here.

Also, in the middle of winter, we get less than 7 hours of daylight, so if you're not used to long, long winter nights and endless drizzle then you're in for a shock and a half.

If you make it through all of those hurdles, though, and last a year here: congratulations, you'll be able to stay here with relatively no problems and get to enjoy everything the great Northwest has to offer.

"&gt; How does a young (24-35) married couple both making roughly 60k expect to have a family within Seattle...Even putting 20% down is not enough to guarantee a close.  ...seems out of reach to start a family without incredible amount of luck in Seattle.

At the risk of sounding brash, the first thing a young married couple with a combined income of $120k can do is revise their expectations.  $120k will carry a mortgage of just over $500k.  Also, remember that $508k is the *median*.  50% of the properties sold did so for less than that amount.

But, then, there's the other thing of a house not being a requirement to ""start a family.""  I've lived in apartments with my spouse and kid; we only bought a house because we stumbled over an excellent deal.  Had it not existed, we would have happily kept right on renting.  A coworker of mine lives comfortably and happily in a 2BR apartment in Redmond with his wife, two kids, and a dog.

If the whole detached house with a picket fence and a big yard dream is a dream of yours, then yes, you've quite likely been priced out of the inner Seattle metro area and you'll either need to revise your dreams or live farther out.  (For what it's worth, I just looked at my old Redfin search for 3BR, detached, under $325k.  19 houses appeared and only two of them are tear-down crapholes.  If I up that number to $450k, I get 40.  Is this sustainable for an entire market?  Probably not.  Is it proof that houses can still be found for a fairly good price?  I think so.)",,,,somenewuser,Central Area,,1452160215,t5_2qhad,t3_3ztnzw,t1_cyp4rma,13,1454334978,0,0,cyp6cq4,Seattle,13,,flair

"* Make yourself visible.

* Make yourself easy to predict.

* Kill em with kindness, use a thumbs up instead of a middle finger when you feel you've been wronged.

* Safety in numbers. Ride a safe distance behind another cyclist when you can. They're clearing the way for you, just make sure you can stop in time if the rider ahead of you tumbles.

* Don't assume people in cars, cops or pedestrians know what they're doing or care. They don't and they're definitely not going to listen to you. Go with the flow, be like water.

* Don't be shy - if someone steps out into the street without looking, give them a verbal announcement. I prefer ""HEYWATCHOUT"". As I narrowly avoid the oblivious. I also have a small bell made by [Spur Cycle](http://www.spurcycle.com/). It's great.

* Confidence: Fake it till you make it. Dont be defeatist, shy or act like you're a second class citizen. Driving is a privilege, they're guests. 

* Take up the whole damn lane. If they honk, it just means they see you. Riding on the sidewalk is legal in Seattle, but see point #5.

* Be smart about treating traffic signs as yield. Hell, be smart about approaching intersections in general. They're the most dangerous part of the road.

* Directing traffic is illegal. If you roll up to a stop sign just after a car does and they wave you through, pass on the invitation to go first (I just shake my head no and smile). It's dangerous. For all you know they could be waving someone else through that you don't see, or they could be trying to do an insurance scam with a dash cam.

"It's related to perspective -- the fact that apparent size of an object decreases with distance. Usually when you see the city in front of the mountains, the city is close, and the mountains are far. So the nearness of the city makes it appear big, and the farness of the mountains makes them look not-so-big.

But from the location of this photo, both the city and the mountains are far, so it's closer to showing a direct comparison of their sizes. Columbia Tower: 930ft, Mount Constance 7700ft. So yes, the Olympics *are* huge. (And of course, the magnification of a long lens is important to allow us to look closely at these distant subjects.)

But the comparison is not quite there yet... in this shot, the mountains are still more than twice as far away as the city (70 miles vs 30 miles). If you want their relative sizes to be directly comparable (still with one right behind the other), you'd have to be an infinite distance away (so they are both equally far).

So I'll close the store!""

Hell, he could probably raise his prices beyond what is needed to pay the taxes and make more money instead.

"There is not currently an app to pay. But the card is cheap - 5 bucks I believe. You can order it online, or you can get it from an ORCA card vending machine. ORCA cards work for King County Metro, Sounder Transit, the Light Rail, and even the ferries (so yes - it does work in Bellevue).  

Buses won't give you change or an extended ticket if you over-pay. If you stick in 5 bucks, you just over-paid for your ride. Drivers will let you pay for you and someone else with one payment though. 


You load money into your e-purse or you can buy a monthly pass. This can be done at vending machines, online, or at some stores like QFC, Safeway, etc. These stores may also sell ORCA cards, but I am not sure on that. Loading your e-purse online takes a day or two for the funds to post to your card (or at least it used to) but the other methods are instant. Vending machines take cash or card.

 When you get on the bus, scan your card and it takes the fare out of your e-purse. Then you have a time frame of a few hours (don't remember the exact time) to get on as many buses as you'd like at no additional charge. There will only be an additional charge if you get on a bus with a higher fare (like going from a KC bus to a Sounder Transit). Also worth noting - if you go from KC to ST, you must use an ORCA card. Paper transfers are not accepted.

You can check out Orcacard.com for more specific info, but at the moment I am posting this, it was down for maintenance.

"The routes from Downtown / SLU to Capitol Hill all scare me.

- Pike street has shared lanes with traffic that is full of drivers that have no idea what lane they want to be in.
- Lakeview has a dedicated lane going uphill that disappears as you make the bend. So many drivers do not realize that bike traffic is suddenly merged into their lane resulting in the frequent brake check.
- Olive can be sketchy especially after Bellevue.

"You're only making a little over $2000 a month?

Bruh.  Rent alone is going to superslam you right into homelessness.  My advice to you is to look for as many roommates as you can stuff into a building without it collapsing.


Slightly less snarky answer: in all seriousness, without multiple roommates you're going to have a hard time affording rent on top of the other utilities, food, transportation, and other expenses.  Seattle is fairly inexpensive by the standards of other American big cities (I don't think we're even in the top 10 but I might be mistaken) but it's still much, much higher than people expect if they come from somewhere not on a coast or near a major metro area.

Average rent in Seattle is ~$1600 if you take into account all neighborhoods and all available units.  You can find something cheaper in the neighborhoods to the north of the ship canal and south of the sports stadiums.

"I have a buddy who works in a place that for awhile only had single gender bathrooms which weree essentially sinks for anyone to use and then toilet stalls that were completely encapsulated (more like toilet closets). No urinals. 

He said the biggest negatives were that all people felt awkward in the bathroom instead of just a couple and that it was a big waste of water in a couple different ways. 

The most obvious way was that with no urinals more water was used for men urinating because urinals use less water. The other way water was being wasted was because people were triple flushing. Flushing once for noise, courtesy flushing for smell, and then flushing to get rid of feces and TP.

Within a year his place of business (500+ people I think) added a womens only bathroom with the argument that women needed their own bathroom. The men were not pleased. When the business expanded they added more single gender bathrooms.

Lastly, he also pointed out that his public school bathrooms had no stall doors in any of the male bathrooms because the schools didn't want the kids to have the privacy. He said some of his friends didn't take a dump at school for their entire HS career.

Personally I don't care if the bathroom are transgender or not. If it was up to me the bathrooms would be designed like the better porta-potties that have both urinals and regular toilets. And for the love of good whoever designs the sinks, please make it so I can get warm to hot water out of them to wash my hands properly.

"&gt;Would you ever do that? Because probably not no, not unless you are presenting as female in some kind of way and also probably registered wherever this locker room is as a female. I've never been in a locker room for a facility that didn't make me sign up in some capacity, have you?

It says nothing about presenting as the gender of the restroom you want to use. It does say ""shall allow access to and use of a facility consistent with that individual's gender identity"".

&gt;Personally I don't think someone who wants to get into a woman's locker room for insidious purposes would go to the trouble, since the door is just a door anyway and the little lady sign isn't a magical barrier or anything.

You are correct. There is no magical barrier. No one has been stopping anyone that looks like a woman from using a woman's restroom or someone who looks like a man from using a man's restroom. It is about prosecuting deviants when they have misused a restroom.

For example, a man dressing as a woman in order to enter a woman's restroom and then exposing himself to those inside the restroom. The more things you can charge a creep like this with the better. But now all he has to say is that he identifies as a woman to avoid being accused of being in the wrong restroom. He won't even be able to be banned from using women's restrooms as long as he claims to identify as a woman because it will be a violation of his rights.

"""Background Checks"" and ""Mental Health"" are both referenced the same number of times in that document. And it's not some trade secret that there is an under-addressed mental health problem in this country and that firearms are the leading method of suicide in WA.

From that very same Office of Financial Management:

&gt; Of the total firearm deaths in 2008-2010, about four out of five (78%) were purposely selfinflicted; in fact, our state’s age-adjusted firearm suicide rate is about four times greater than its firearm homicide rate and over sixty times greater than its unintentional firearm-injury death rate. 

We've known that mental health is a problem in this country, just like we've known suicides were a problem in our state and that most were being committed with firearms and that we are *massively* short on local mental health resources. But now that we can tie it to state and federal level gun control pushes, we suddenly give a shit. 

I'm not saying they're wrong to address it *now*, I'm just saying don't believe for a minute that it has anything to do with some genuine concern for your wellbeing or safety. This is political, it was political in '94, it was political when the NRA called for action on mental health two years ago, it's political today.

"What can WE do NOW to get OTHER PEOPLE to stop driving downtown?  Really, we're doing the best thing we can, which is nothing, and letting traffic get absolutely godawful, and so touchy that a single accident can bring the entire metro area to a standstill.  It's hard to make a worse environment for driving than that.

Now, if you actually want to free yourself from this awful environment, I'm a big fan of electric bikes.  They're all of the utility of a bicycle (bike lanes, bike paths in some areas, pedestrian overpasses, etc) with a good bit less of the downsides (showing up to work sweaty, or wearing rain gear and showing up to work still sweaty, and having to haul yourself up long hills).

I wrote up something useful for the area specifically on electric bikes: http://syonyk.blogspot.com/2015/06/electric-bikes-for-commuting-in-greater.html

I've been ebiking on the east side for about 2.5 years now, and I frequently describe it as ""the least miserable form of transport I've found so far.""  I don't actually like getting cold and wet, but I prefer that to sitting in what's essentially random traffic (though the crappier days, weather-wise, also tend to be radically worse, traffic-wise, so it evens out).

The advantages:

* My commute is almost as fast as driving during normal rush hours, and significantly faster than peak commute times before I built one.
* My commute is incredibly consistent.  The huge storm that took out the east side a few months ago?  It took me about 2 minutes more than usual to get home, because I had to go around some downed tree branches.
* I can use the bike lanes and pedestrian overpasses, which is a wonderful way of going past the parking lot the roads become regularly.
* With the battery pack for the motor, I can run a lot of lighting - so I can see and be seen, far better than any other bike I've ridden.
* With the motor assist, I don't get sweaty, even in the hot weather.  I'll be a bit warm after climbing a hill, but it's not the half an hour dripping with sweat that happened when I was riding a normal bike to work.
* In the cold weather, I can wear fully waterproof rain gear, and not soak myself through.  Normally, the good waterproof stuff doesn't breathe so you sweat inside it, but with the motor, that's not a problem.
* My daily commute energy cost is about a nickel for 10 miles round trip.  I use literally a tenth the energy of an electric car (30-35Wh/mi), and my bike isn't particularly efficient.
* If your office or home is tight on parking, you can park in the bike racks, which almost always have free spots.

I can't offer much for how to get other people to stop driving (though our current approach seems pretty good).  But if you want to at least get from point A to point B, quickly and consistently, an electric bike is a great solution out here.  Year round.  Does it suck coming home in the driving rain?  Yeah.  But it's still better than driving.

If you have kids or want to make even more of a car replacement, consider an electric cargo bike.  They'll haul as much as a small car and still have all the advantages of a bike.",,,,Syonyk,,,1453271932,t5_2qhad,t3_41sb3c,t3_41sb3c,32,1454607535,0,0,cz4y6fv,Seattle,32,,

"I don't know the stats, but I read how a significant portion of the homeless are people who are legitimately down on their luck and who would like to work.  (Anecdotally, my mom worked in a shelter for many years and told me that half of the people are just unlucky, trying to get out of their situation, and the other half are mentally ill.)  

Seems to me there's space for some kind of program where people can work in exchange for subsidized housing and money to get themselves a leg up, and one of the things that really needs to be done is cleaning up the trash that's multiplying around the city.  

Not all of the homeless are going to partake, obviously, but there are some who would.  And let's face it, the city is starting to need it.

"Seattlite here: 

I buy my guns and ammo in Lynnwood or Shoreline already. They're like 30 min away or less. I Still live in Seattle. I Still carry daily. The only change this law made is the loss of tax revenue from people like me for Seattle but who still bought ammo here. Seriously a box of 9mm is about $11.99 per box (for cheap stuff) out side Seattle and like $14.99 in Seattle already... That's 50 rounds. Add the 5 cent tax and we are at $17.49. Why would I buy in town? Check this out; I can't even shoot in town, anyway. So my behaviour is hardly changed. I'll just go to a shop on the way to the range or woods just like I've been doing already. And now others will, too. 

 Liberals, please listen. The ammo you are taxing is our range ammo... That's our *practice* ammo. Not our *carry* ammo. So if we are effected at all, it's our practice that is affected. This tax makes us less likely to practice, thus we become worse shots. Our carry ammo is way expensive (designed not to go through walls, or not to leave exit wounds, etc) and never shot until (hopefully never at all) it is needed. You buy it once in the life of the gun, load up a dedicated magazine, and that's it. Why would you shoot $25.99 per box ammo at the range when $11.99 ammo is right next to it? You wouldn't! So that's not being effected really, since is a one time buy. It's our practice range ammo that we buy 100 rounds of our more per month that is effected. I'm not going to move from Seattle. I live here, I work here, my friends do too, my gf does too, I'm not leaving. I'll just drive 30 min and give some one else my money, you lose tax revenue, we are still here and now are slightly worse shots, and now you are more likely to suffer cause fatigue. 

Seattle has a 1 in 18 ccw per resident... And all those people are no longer going to buy in Seattle but, we aren't going to move away (our jobs and lives are here), we aren't going to stop carrying since what ever caused us to carry in the first place is still here (the crime, muggings, assaults, robberies, etc), we are just worse shots and now you have less money.

"I'm someone who has actually helped to run one of the caucuses before (and I'll be doing so for part of the 11th Legislative District this round).  I'll try to explain a little.

The caucus system is thought to promote more activism within the party.  People who want to go to the national convention can do so by being elected delegate at each step in the process.  Here's how it goes: 
1) at the precinct caucuses, convince your neighbors that your support for Bernie/Hillary/O'Malley is good and you'll be a decent representative for them going up to the next level.
2) Let's say you get elected as a delegate or alternate, then you go to the Legislative District caucus.  You again, convince your fellow people from your LD that you're a good representative for the person you're passionate about.  You get elected from the delegates that made it up to the current level.
3) You're now at the Congressional District level.  Congrats, people really like and respect you.  You're now convincing the others that made it to this level that you're great and will do a good job at the national convention.  You win the election.
4) You're at the national convention and you get to cast your vote for the person you were elected to be a delegate for.

Why is this system good?  It means that you're elected by your peers, not necessarily party officials.  In order to rise up the ranks, you had to learn how to campaign and survive the gauntlet.  Chances are you're either hooked for life and really do want to help your party or you're burnt out and bitter about the process.  Either way, it promotes a kind of activism that and party involvement you may not see in a Primary process.

Why is this system bad?  You're right, it isn't exactly kind to the layperson who isn't inclined to participate in a process like this, or to someone who just can't take the time off of work.

I've got mixed feelings about this system and can see the good and bad in both.  A primary might be a truer representation of the actual electorate, but it doesn't necessarily breed the kind of activism that ends up getting people to run get out the vote / phone banking operations for candidates within the party.  In any case, the primary isn't a governmental function, it's a private party function that's left up to the individual political parties on how they want to operate.  

I hope that helps provide some context.  I honestly don't see this process as being pro/against any candidate, by nature.  During the 2008 presidential cycle, the grassroots really showed up and got Obama nominated.  During the 2012 cycle, the caucuses were sparsely attended.",,,,seleniumdream,,,1453588077,t5_2qhad,t3_42cq9p,t1_cz9cy35,15,1454685496,0,0,cz9dkhi,Seattle,15,,

"This one is totally fake but typically in order to get the ""big moon"" effect photographically, you'd have to use a very long telephoto lens which means standing really far away from your foreground. Think about it- If you move back 5 miles from say the space needle, the space needle is going to look much smaller to the naked eye, but from the earth, the moon is pretty much the same distance so when you zoom in from that far, the zooming will compress the foreground while making the background bigger.

 The other challenge is that the moon is usually much brighter than the foreground (it's daytime there after all) so unless there is a lunar eclipse (blood moon) or your foreground is also very bright, getting the ""big moon"" effect is quite a challenge and why a lot of photographers cheat and photoshop it.

Going by the story the landlord communicated the situation poorly, sure, but it's ultimately *his house* and he gets to decide what he wants to do with it after meeting any legal obligations. If there's no lease in place then he can give you 20 days notice at almost any time, for almost any reason (and conversely, the tenant has the same right!).

"A human can be smart, however factor in groupthink and the subtle fuckery of many types of manipulation (fatigue, emotional, stressor, misinformation, etc) and people, on average, are not that intelligent.

Imagine a friend of yours who is of average intelligence, think of all the dumb things that they do. Now, realize that about half of all people are less intelligent than that person

To further this thought experiment, let's take a profession like a neurosurgeon. Most people would consider someone who works in this field to be very intelligent, particularly someone who is working at a prestigious facility. It takes considerable schooling, at top-tier schools like Yale to get a job at these places.

"let me guess, because we haven't kicked all the single family owners out and built the maximum density that the laws of science will allow.

One thing I'd ask the pro density people is this: So let's say we build everything we possibly can.  Does this not just attract even more investment and even more wealth?  Does this not sooner or later wind up like a Hong Kong or a Singapore - physical footprint built out to the maximum that is possible, yet still now unaffordable for all but legacy owners and 1% investors?

The incessant ""build more"" plan seems to have the endgame of we have another Vancouver boom, followed by.... a way bigger downtown, all the single family livability gone, a bigger scale town but ... still no affordability.

"Flash photography in places where it is explicitly forbidden is one of my biggest pet peeves.  Years ago on a family trip around Italy, my parents and I were continuously irked by people too stupid, careless, or disrespectful to follow the rules that protect centuries old priceless works of art.  Our very last night of the three week trip we were in Milan and visited Da Vinci's *The Last Supper*, which is an enormous mural.  On the way in you pass through multiple air locks to precisely control the temperature and humidity.  The room is darkened to protect the sensitive paint from degrading.  There are signs everywhere in multiple languages with obvious pictograms forbidding flash photography.  Then this group of Korean businessmen walked in behind us and all started taking flash pictures.  My dad had politely corrected tourists the previous three weeks of the trip, while my mother and I kept silent.  But this time was different.  This was the straw that broke the camels back.  All at once we started violently spewing abuse at these scofflaws.  They shrunk away from us with shock and surprise, and quickly filed out of the viewing room.  We may have confirmed their notion of loud Americans, but the catharsis of that moment overshadowed all the other little annoyances of that trip.

"I'm sure that my experience is unusual, but Seattle in the late 90's was the only place I saw blatant racism while touring the USA for a few months. We had just arrived at a hotel, and asked if there were rooms. There were. No problem. While we were still in the reception, a African American guy comes in, asking if there's space. ""No, I'm afraid we are sold out."" Guy leaves. Not a minute later another white guy comes in and asks if they have rooms. And it's ""Yep, that's no problem. Lot's of space. What are you looking for?"" 

I always feel it's bad to judge based on one incident. On the other hand, if you see something once, in just a short visit, maybe that's because it's commonplace, and whatever it is entirely representative.

We toured most of the US, and while we saw a few more incidences of racism, they weren't blatantly obvious or deliberate... A kid from the midwest somewhere who was seeing someone who wasn't white person for the first time, couldn't stop staring, and asked his parents why those people were black. Parents were pretty embarrassed. 

Fourth of July celebrations in Washington, D.C., where there was a concert on the lawns of the capitol. One of the performers was African American, Grover Washington maybe (it'll come back to me in a bit). There were tens of thousands of people. We only saw one African American family. And they left because they didn't like the atmosphere. Washington D.C., for those who don't know, is something like 80% African American.

The border between US and Mexico, where we were just waved through, without even a passport check, because we were white, and were assumed to be American. Probably helped that we had US plates. Still, the people with brown skins were all stopped.

It was clear to us in the 90's anyway, that race was a problem in the US, once of those schisms that societies have, that are almost impossible to see if you never travel and experience other cultures. Of course it wasn't the only one. Guns vs no-guns. Bible belt vs not. 

At the time we were looking for a country to settle in, and probably could have been welcome almost anywhere. In part the experience in Seattle is one of the reasons we chose not to live in the USA; we decided we didn't want to raise kids in a place that had that many problems.

Since then I've visited the US a bunch of times on business and holiday. Though much less in the last few years; entering the US as a foreigner is not much fun, and the internet has made it so much easier to get things done without having to visit in person. 

But I'm amazed that it's held together despite the massive fault-lines in society. I suspect it's a few things - the oath of allegiance in schools, the story people tell about anyone being able to be a millionaire, the amount of space, that means that rich and poor are separated, so the poor never see how the rich really live, Christians don't ever have to meet a hardline atheist, and more.

Look for intersections of high bike traffic with busy roads that clog up and poor infrastructure: that is the holy grail of getting taken out. Ballard bridge is pretty widely accepted as terrible however as others have mentioned.

I can personally add from my regular experiences:

* Stone Way and 34/35th in the morning. There is a ton of traffic for those intersections. The Burke crossing there is also very busy.
* The entire Montlake/520 interchange area. Its a mix of paths, sidewalks, lanes, and angry bumper to bumper people coming/going on the freeway.  
* Dexter and Denny
* All of 12th around Cap hill can be a bit nerve wracking at times: bike lane is in the door zone and lots of cross street traffic and cabs/Ubers stopping.

"Valid question. From an earlier post that has since been deleted:

There are a number of reasons for the public's dislike of the proposed sale to KUOW:

- KPLU has been serving the greater Puget Sound for 50 years...it's just as much an institution as KUOW and has it's own loyal listener base. In fact, because of KPLU's location, it actually serves portions of the Puget Sound that KUOW doesn't reach - the sale would deprive those listeners of local and national news coverage.

- There has been controversy over KUOW's local news reporting (or lack thereof) for many years.

- Listeners of KUOW were also shocked that there was no transparency surrounding the collection of funds by KUOW to pay for this sale. They kept going back to the public for pledge drives asking for funds, when all the while they had a reserve of millions.

- No guarantee of jobs for KPLU reporters after the sale.

- The sale would also deprive communications and journalism students at PLU (where KPLU has its studios) from the valuable hands-on involvement/access to the station.

- They gave the public absolutely NO notice of the sale prior to the vote to make it happen. So there was no opportunity for the public to voice concerns. They might not have been required to give notice, but it certainly doesn't engender any good will for KUOW.

[Here's a piece that mentions the $50,000 rule](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/foreign-investors-pose-threat-to-residential-real-estate-2015-06-15).

Someone was commenting in another part of this thread that it's been happening in Vancouver, too -- the homes aren't even put on the rental market, taking them completely out of the pool of available housing (with predictable results).  That first article even references [a Tumblr full of images of vacant foreign-owned Vancouver homes](http://beautifulemptyhomes.tumblr.com/), falling into disrepair *(which of course is then going to damage nearby property values)*.

I don't blame Chinese citizens for wanting to protect their personal assets from a totalitarian government in whatever way they can.  However, their money isn't subject to the same legal environment as ours is -- who's to say that it wasn't obtained in part through the mistreatment of a factory labor force? -- so it's not a level playing field.  Furthermore, I'm disgusted with the idea of foreign ownership of US property, especially when it drives up the cost of purchasing a residential home for people who actually live here, paying taxes and contributing to our local economy, people who want to become more permanent members of their local community.

"Uh, what? 

&gt; giant tunnel just to improve rich people's expensive views

The viaduct needs to be taken down for safety reasons. Some replacement needed to happen.

&gt; a new floating bridge just for the rich

The bridge is past is useful life. It's a safety issue that we needed to replace it. You know you don't need to pay if ride transit.

&gt; Was removing general use travel lanes really to improve traffic for everyone or just to provide a fast convience lane for rich people?

Putting in the ETL lanes was necessary to maintain a federal funding requirement that HOV lanes must, on average, stay above 45 MPH.

&gt; FREE AND OPEN FOR EVERYONE, as all roads should be! Roads should never become a private convience just for rich people.

They aren't private. You're welcome and free to drive on them just as *anybody* else is. You just have to pay for it now.

Think of it like this: public sentiment (and/or government budgets) are slowly moving away from fully subsidizing road infrastructure. Now the people who use that infrastructure are being asked to pay for it. This is for a couple reasons: growth and density in the region has literally outstripped our physical capacity to support it using road infrastructure. I.e. we don't have the physical geography to build 18 lane highways to really put a dent in the traffic problems in the region. Another reasons is that we can move more *people* (not cars) more efficiently using transit options. People from other regions and cities moving here have experienced public transport and living without a vehicle and want that here. And good for them. Less cars is good.

All that having been said: I agree to some degree that where transit options aren't available (and that's a lot of the place!) the new tolling schemes *effectively* act like a tax on the poor. Or their commute (to their jobs, likely) can suffer. That's a problem. But since we can't build more roads, and our population is rising, the best thing to do is get more transit in the region. Relying on road infrastructure to move people in SOVs just isn't going to scale.

"No need for name calling.

Okay. So a business has allocated $100/hour for an average 40 hour work week to pay for labor. 

Imagine we pay everyone the same amount of money per hour. If the minimum wage is $9.09/hour I can have 10 people working. If the minimum wage is $12.5/hour I can have 8 people working. If the minimum wage is $14.28/hour I can have 7 people working.

Not all paid positions are created equally. There's maybe a manager, an assistant manager, maybe a handful of senior employees.

I have to pay more for my senior employees and managers, they have experience, they have education, or skills that set themselves apart from the rest of my employees.

Suddenly the pie shrinks for entry-level employees. This is why I am not an advocate for the minimum wage. The market is going to favor automation or it's simply not going to hire. In the case of automation you're going to see the money going to the company that writes the software for the self-checkout machines or the touchscreens at McDonalds.

I would argue that the reason why wages have not risen proportionately with corporate profit is our monetary policy. Corporations didn't just suddenly decide to become greedy in 1971 (when wages stopped rising with corporate profit).

Higher wages =/= higher employment. This means 1 employee gets more money to feed their family while another employee, or two, or three lose their jobs, lose hours, or can't find a job elsewhere because they're priced out of the market.

It's a bad idea. It'll give you the warm and fuzzies for the first couple of years because the market will not react to it immediately. As soon as technology catches up and can replace a low-skilled worker, the effects are devastating. A shining example is Detroit.

Have a nice life!

"""Homeless"" doesn't actually describe anything.  

What people call homeless is usually dirty, unkempt, or crazy looking.  A lot of them have homes.  There are half a dozen halfway homes for mentally ill on Capitol Hill.  They dress them, feed them, give them meds and then they are free to wander around begging for money to buy smokes or alcohol they shouldn't have with their meds.  None of them are homeless.

Then there are the suburb kids who like to pretend they are runaways, their mom's pick them up in minivans at the end of their excursion into the evil city.  Some of them are real runaways but most seem to have someone to do their laundry and pay for their phones.
There are the scammers, the ones who hang out at the onramps with the cardboard signs.  It is amazing how many of those have nice cars.

Protecting people doesn't usually involve throwing them in prison.  If the law were intended to protect people, then it wouldn't make prostitution illegal.  Making prostitution illegal allows the criminal element (pimps) to profit, and make prostitution dangerous.  It also prevents prostitutes from going to the police, which enables their abuse at the hands of Johns.

The idea that prostitution laws are protecting anyone is hopelessly naive.  The law makes prostitution vastly more dangerous.  When it catches prostitutes, it punishes them with prison (which makes their lives harder and reduces their options).

"I've heard this before from folks in the South, but in my experience (moved to Baton Rouge from Chicago about 3 years ago) people are just friendlier in casual conversations with each other.  The Southern Hospitality stereotype is real.  But if you actually sit down and have a long conversation, there's a shitload of bitterness and resentment on both sides, and I overhear casual racism both inside and outside my classroom fairly frequently, which is a bit surprising when you consider how colleges are often liberal bastions (I study/teach at LSU, doing the grad school thing).

One of the reasons people think the South is more peacefully co-exisiting might be that you see less protests in the streets, less public outcries.  I'd argue this isn't actually a good thing.  The percentage of African-American students at LSU in comparison to the city/parish/state demographics is pretty low compared to other universities.  Baton Rouge is statistically a more dangerous city than Chicago.  In terms of public health, education, and safety, Lousiana tends to rank right at they very bottom.  Like many Southern states, they're actively trying to shut down Planned Parenthood and effectively close other abortion clinics that, despite what you might think about abortion, provide health-care services to low-income women.  Louisiana's minimum wage is among the lowest in the country (it's at the federally mandated minimum, I believe).

I understand that I'm an outsider, looking at the South from a cultural perspective that's generally characterized it as backwards and dysfunctional.  But I'm still regularly shocked at stuff, both in terms of race &amp; sexuality - it's both the historical legacy that pops up in weird places (the fact that some of the professors I work with lived in a time where black people weren't allowed to attend LSU, or the weird golliwog dolls and sambo merchandise that you find at roadside tourist attractions), and the sharp political views (the recent attempt by the predominantly white, affluent section of Baton Rouge to form its own city, the obsession with attacking Obama even in political races he's entirely detached from, the active resistance against introducing legislation that protects gay and lesbian workers from discrimination, or the bizarre campaign ad by a black Republican lieutenant governor where he explained [the many definitions of nigger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1z3hmyt5E4), or how way back in the '90s Louisiana helped a state representative and KKK Grand Wizard get a presidential campaign going).

I guess what I'm saying is - and I'm saying this knowing I may be biased - is that the integration and peaceful coexistence you're experiencing (I'm assuming your writing from a Southern perspective) might be a bit more superficial and tenuous than you think. The friendliness you see in people's faces is a lot different from their political views, and I'd argue the latter says a lot more about how they really feel in regards to race.

&gt; State engineers noticed after the sinkhole formed that additional voids existed, and STP didn’t have a clear plan to deal with them, according to Inslee.

So apparently, after STP filled ""the sinkhole,"" there were other sinkholes-in-formation that STP hasn't noticed either.

That's OK, though - they have an excuse!

3.  Shield:  Shields are heavy, so now both of your hands are being used to try to maneuver this heavy shield in hopes of defending yourself from the armed attacker. If you're successful and don't get slashed/stabbed, it still doesn't provide a way to arrest the guy. 

4.  Rubber bullets:  So, hope that rubber bullets convince the guy who is asking the officers to kill him  to change his mind, put the knife down and willingly comply?  Even after being shot with real bullets the guy got up and into the cop car. I'm not sure your expectation of how (in)effective rubber bullets or real bullets for that matter are at stopping a determined attacker. 

5.  Bean Bag Guns:  See #4.

6.  Police training:  These officers appear to have had great training!

"You can get to the article via a google search : boeing and decline of middle class
&gt;“This is no longer your father’s company,” proclaimed a senior executive at Boeing in 1998, sending a chill through the aircraft maker’s thousands of employees.
With this, Boeing began a series of radical changes that transformed it from a family-oriented business that looked after employee welfare into a more aggressive, corporate culture that prioritised shareholder value and executive remuneration. Other companies followed its lead, unleashing a wave of change that has transformed the US workforce.

&gt;Boeing’s changes, sparked by a merger with rival McDonnell Douglas, included the relocation of work to cheaper places, the outsourcing of key components and aggressive cost cuts.
These details, and conclusions drawn from them, form the basis of Emerging from Turbulence, for which academics Leon Grunberg and Sarah Moore at the University of Puget Sound interviewed hundreds of Boeing employees anonymously over 20 years.
Mr Grunberg says that the company remained profitable but the changes contributed to the hollowing out of the US middle class and a distrust of authority that has prompted a rise in anti-establishment sentiment. Boeing has declined to comment.
One employee, who worked at the company for 30 years, said that Boeing had a “collegial, bloated, flaccid management structure”, adding that the McDonnell Douglas executives were “mainly finance guys” who “cut through the Boeing people like a knife through butter”.",,,,WT_Dore,,,1453420341,t5_2qhad,t3_422ssx,t3_422ssx,12,1454645578,0,0,cz75e33,Seattle,12,,

"This is an embarrassing witch hunt to make the victims families happy they got their eye for an eye.

From all accounts accused seems like a terrible human being.

He was charged for obtaining firearms illegally, based on a tribal court order and a domestic violence charge from his current wife. The system totally failed, this dude passed 10 background checks because he didn't check a box, and the system couldn't cope with connecting the dots.

&gt;Fryberg bought at least 10 guns, each time filling out a form and checking the “no” box when asked about a protective order. He also passed multiple FBI background checks — including one for a concealed-carry permit — because of a glitch in the tribal domestic-violence reporting system that the Department of Justice says it is now trying to fix.

If someone this clueless can walk into a store and get the background checks that everyone really wants mandatory and expanded and still get access, the system is broken.

This whole thing should be an indictment how the system works, if it works at all. Instead we get this dog and pony show where everyone pats themselves on the back that the bad man went to jail for 10 months.

"I think Airbnb is an ok service if the property owner lives onsite - but an independent study and Airbnb's own numbers show that a disproportionate amount of their revenue comes from people operating what amounts to illegal hotels: they rent multiple units across the city and use them exclusively for Airbnb. This is explicitly against the lease in those buildings and a shitty thing to do because it takes units off the actual rental market to be used for private profit without even giving back to the city in the form of taxes...and of course there's noise and safety concerns from the other tenants. 

A friend of mine lived in a nice new building on Pine right below one of these illegal full-time Airbnb places - and the ""guests"" would throw wild parties regularly (like thumping bass at 4am on a Friday morning), if you'd go up to complain it was a different person every time so eventually he found the listing on Airbnb for it...and despite reporting them to the property management several times they stayed in business (eviction proceedings can take a long time).

"C&amp;P from a x-post.


Some basic info :

1.  I was not in my car when this happened. I walked up to my car and noticed it was on the curb. I thought I had did a really bad parking job until I went to the driver's side and realized its leg fell off.

2.  Contacted police. Was told it would take hours to get a response because it was New Years Eve.

3.  Contacted insurance. Said they can tow but what's the point when there's nothing open tonight.

I went back out to my car after talking to the police and insurance at my friend's place and saw a police car behind my car. They have been called because someone called them earlier about a hit &amp; run. The place I was parked also has a lot of video cameras so hopefully when they match up the call with footage of the video (hopefully they had one facing the street) they can get a positive ID on the vehicle.

For now my car is stranded until possibly Monday until it can find a hospital.

Damage from what I can see :

1.  Rear axle is done.

2.  Side frame is done. (hard to tell from picture literally the whole driver's side is caved in.

3.  Pretty sure front axle + right tire is damaged in some way. It hopped a curb... sideways...

Don't drink and drive you morons.

I applaud their attempt to compete, they're doing it right, I just feel industry forces are aligned against them, in the form of Delta's expansion plans putting them squarely in Delta's crosshairs, and in the form of American's legacy footprint also blocking them from key destinations like Dallas.

Delta even went so far as to attempt to get an ex Delta pilot elected to the Port of Seattle.  That failed, but I doubt they're finished trying.  Delta's been trying every trick to undermine Alaska here, from sponsoring local teams to dressing themselves up like a local brand, with that ""local"" CEO they use in their ads.

Delta's been flying Horizon routes, Portland and Boise and Spokane now .. to try and starve out Alaska.  Delta can afford to run these routes at a loss, Alaska really can't because it depends on that revenue as formerly its ""backyard.""  Delta's out to drive Alaska profitability down, then it can swoop in with the buyout.  So flippin obvious.

Personally, I don't get it, but this 'courtesy' is apparently a real thing. So to answer your question, removing the gender restriction would probably be very quickly followed by people demanding that men's restrooms remove all urinals and only have private stalls.

Not to mention, men would suddenly have to experience first-hand the legendary nightmare that is women's restroom filth.

"The thing that I don't understand about modern society, especially this generation, is the lack of consistency everyone has with their ideals. People scoff at opponents to bikini barista joints, pulling the argument about freedom of speech and expression and the right to do as one pleases without harming anyone, yet the same camp will try to verbally lynch you for open-carrying, or even advocating open-carry of, a holstered firearm in public, for example (and *solely* for example. Don't turn this into a gun debate). The same exists on the flip-side, with the point being that someone, somewhere and somehow, is going to expose you or your precious children to something that you find offensive. There are instances where looking the other way can suffice, like when a homeless guy is hammering the meat on the sidewalk in full view, but when it's a permanent establishment that you pass every day on your way to work, sometimes looking the other way isn't really an option. That's when things need to be looked at from a legal point of view and some form of action needs to be considered. Do we want public nudity? No. Do we want a bazooka in a display case? No.

Now, I've seen many of these joints from street view, and all of them have done a very good job of protecting everyone's eyes from what lies within, and as long as that is the case, I don't see a reason why these places shouldn't exist. Wanting to ban them outright is treading the fragile tightrope of infringing on freedom of expression. Should the views be discreet? Yes; but they should also be allowed to conduct business as they see fit.

However, it should also be the right of a community to determine for itself what it wants and to not have its ways of life upset by a small vocal minority. If 99% of the population of a city wants them gone, and 1% wants them to stay, why should they be allowed to stay? If a peaceful group of Neo-Nazis set up a store of Nazi regalia in Capitol Hill, do you think they would last very long? We can argue that people don't have to go there if they don't like it, but the fact is that sometimes merely existing in the presence of a polar opposite can create hatred and animosity, and sometimes it's best to just accept that maybe things shouldn't be where they are for the sake of maintaining a happy and peaceful population; which is a tough concept to swallow for a generation that has been spoon-fed anti-establishment propaganda from birth and feels that every action made needs to shake ground.

I think that the people of Eastern Washington can decide for themselves whether or not they want Bikini Barista joints without the help of Seattle's population watching this video and putting shame and pressure on the politicians and inhabitants to adapt to the ways of a city that has a completely different cultural, political, and social population.

"I was going to write a long, dry response to your opposition of ""well-regulated"", but the SCOTUS majority opinion in DC v Heller (2008) is actually very precise, detailed, and succinctly written:

""Held: 1. The Second Amendment protects an individual right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia, and to use that arm for traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home. (a) The Amendment’s prefatory clause announces a purpose, but does not limit or expand the scope of the second part, the operative clause. The operative clause’s text and history demonstrate that it connotes an individual right to keep and bear arms. (b) The prefatory clause comports with the Court’s interpretation of the operative clause. The “militia” comprised all males physically capable of acting in concert for the common defense. The Anti-federalists feared that the Federal Government would disarm the people in order to disable this citizens’ militia, enabling a politicized standing army or a select militia to rule. The response was to deny Congress power to abridge the ancient right of individuals to keep and bear arms, so that the ideal of a citizens’ militia would be preserved.""

It's important to understand that, even when trying to understand the 2A in the ""context"" of the period, the militia was understood as all able-bodied men. Given the frequency of criminal gangs, Native American raids, and European incursions, having an armed pool of men available was seen as integral to the security of America as a free state. Militia or privately-led military adventurism didn't even die out until the Spanish-American War, and before that was always an important component of America's wars.

To be short, you would need to ""conveniently ignore"" either historical or SCOTUS precedent in determining that the militia clause only confers a collective right of individuals to possess arms within the strictures of government power.  The 2A has always been widely acknowledged to be a check on federal power, even in the time it was written.

For more information of the evolution of American defense and military needs, check out this very interesting book: http://books.simonandschuster.com/For-the-Common-Defense/Allan-R-Millett/9781451623536

EDIT:  I would also like to point out that SCOTUS and lower court rulings regarding the 2A have consistently upheld reasonable regulations on arms, although laws whose intent or purpose are the general prohibition of arms (useful in either individual or collective defense) to law-abiding citizens have been frequently overturned on the basis of this ruling and McDonald v Chicago (2010).  Still, the important conclusion is that local, state, and federal governments cannot enact laws that prohibit citizens from keeping and bearing arms for lawful purposes.

"&gt; I come from a small town in Florida, and we would have a massive block party, street vendors selling food, carnival rides, bands playing and lots of booze.

Four of the five things you listed are elements which are highly plentiful in a more temperate environment. Compare winter activities in Seattle to summer activities and you'll get my point. 

When you live in an area where the weather is more static and predictable, then festivities like what you are talking about make sense. Winters in Seattle are anything but predictable and this year was a cold one, so it makes sense that you wouldn't have the same thing up here. 

Edited to add: in past years, celebrations were largely subsidized by larger employers in the area (particularly WA Mutual and the Bon Marche and the like). As the recession and mergers eliminated those companies, no other entities really stepped up to fill the void.

"Free speech doesn't kill. Firearms do. 

Rights are defined by the constitution and can be repealed or amended through process. And, it is up to us as a nation to reevaluate those 'rights' if they end up harming a lot of people or if they make our nation less safe. 

For instance, we originally had a right to own slaves in certain parts of this country. It was later repealed.  If you asked what were 'god given' rights in 1800 versus 2000 for most citizens you would have had different answers on whether it was a right to own another person. Rights change as society and technology changes.

We have too many guns in this country, and more guns is not going to make it any safer. It's certainly not going to prevent the 68% of deaths by suicide - if anything it will increase it. And it won't decrease the deaths by accidental shooting, either. Deaths by firearm will only increase with more guns, and will only decrease with less guns. 

You want to have a discussion about mental illness? Fine, but you must realize that a lot of people who accidentally and purposefully kill are not mentally ill according to psychiatric standards. And, you have to accept the fact that there is such a stigma on those who are mentally ill that doing more labeling and branding is not going to help them one bit. Of course, it's also glossing over the fact that it will likely take 100 years and untold amounts of money to tackle mental health in this country due to how much mental illness there is both accounted and unaccounted for. 

Or we can do the safe thing and try to reduce the number of handguns in this country. 

Ask yourself this - if we reduced the number of handguns in this country by 10 or even 20 percent, would the number of murders or deaths by handguns be higher or lower?",,,,vesomortex,,,1451944553,t5_2qhad,t3_3zexuz,t1_cylzxxa,-13,1454280214,0,0,cym092o,Seattle,-13,,

"I completely disagree, most of the replies are vehemently against the poor in this and other threads.  Calling them ""fucks"" and generalizing serves them no favor.  

You have to break it down into two categories, one, as I said earlier is a mental health issue.  Second is unemployment, bad luck, domestic violence victims, runaways etc.  It would be silly to address such a complex issue as homelessness in a Reddit  thread.  

Since you are a citizen of Germany, I'd point to your schrebergartens [massive community gardens] as what your country did to combat homelessness after WWII.  Looks like a huge effort was put into feeding the poor back then.  What about Seattle?  Just sweep them away like trash.

"We got a lot of calls today at the vet I work at about the canine influenza (and people freaking out about it). The news is doing its best to feed on people's fear. Here are some facts:

1. Only two dogs in the state have tested positive as of now - they received it from two other dogs somewhere else - and the boarding facility they went to closed down as a precaution.

2. It is passed from coughing/sneezing/saliva of infected dogs (just like humans).

3. It does not infect humans or cats.

4. There is a vaccine, but it's relatively new. Our vet office personally will only be offering it to animals who are more at risk (immune compromised, older, etc) because we don't want to unnecessarily vaccinate animals with little proof the vaccine works effectively. 

5. The news is really hyping this up more than is necessary right now, and they are purposely trying to create a panic: It is easily treatable if your animal does catch it, but at the moment the chances are very low. Symptoms are coughing/sneezing/fever/lethargy/vomiting/loss of appetite - basically the kind of symptoms you always want to have your dog checked out for. If you are worried your dog has it, please keep them away from other dogs and get them into the vet.

"I was going to point that out. Living in the South, there's still a huge amount of racism, but some of the current segregation, like churches, is also part of Southern African Americans retaining their own culture. There are numerous ""black"" denominations where non-blacks aren't exactly welcomed either: some Missionary Baptist, AME, AOH, CME. I don't see them as being racist but interested in not having their churches appropriated. 

For a lot of people who haven't spent time in the South, they picture only Jim Crowe imagery, but they don't see the fact that the South also boasts the United States' [largest African American population](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_by_African-American_population), many historic African American communities and cities ([Atlanta](http://www.theroot.com/articles/culture/2010/06/is_atlanta_home_to_americas_black_wealth.html), [New Orleans](http://www.neworleansonline.com/neworleans/multicultural/multiculturalhistory/africanamerican.html), [Africatown](http://bridgethegulfproject.org/blog/2013/alabama-community-founded-former-slaves-now-under-siege-tar-sands) in Prichard), 80% of the county's [HBCU's](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_historically_black_colleges_and_universities), [rapidly growing African American interracial families](http://mobile.nytimes.com/2011/03/20/us/20race.html?referer=), and is the home of many African American [traditions](http://hubpages.com/education/africanamericanculture)/[arts](http://www.eusa.org/exhibit/SouthernJourneys/description). 

There's no denying that this culture was born out of terrible things: slavery, oppression, exploitation, and poverty; nor is there denying an ""old guard"" in the South that continues a terrible part of Southern bigotry (did someone say Roy Moore?), but the South's racial climate also comes from a place where African Americans are an active part of almost every community. I've literally lived my entire life in communities that were predominantly African American. Almost every family I know, including my own, includes African Americans, and I think the contributions, beauty, and history of modern Southern African American culture are sometimes disregarded in the focus on the white South. There are unofficially segregated places, and some are because of racist whites, but a lot are also part of African American cultural preservation. 

African Americans have a growing presence and influence in the South, especially the few urban places: Atlanta, New Orleans, Baton Rouge, Birmingham, Jackson, Montgomery, and Mobile. The old assholes are dying off (please Roy Moore), along with, thankfully, a large bit of their bigotry, and I've got a positive outlook for the South in the long game. Even working in very rural Mississippi, where it's practically the 70's, there were no shortage of gay couples, ubiquitous interracial families, atheist clubs, etc. There's a hugely long way to go, but I see times changing, and I hope it continues with younger people.

Be decisive and take the initiative when the other driver flinches, or even before then if you see a break between you where one car can duck into an opening in front of a driveway.

That's one of the things that actually makes me laugh during these ""community meetings"" and such about diverse types of housing.

"As more people get frustrated with what appears to be lawlessness and the apparent degradation of their neighborhoods, it becomes less likely that they are going to have the warm fuzzies about passing taxes that will end up helping those who need it the most.   As people get frustrated by apparent inaction by city officials to deal with the problem they may become more likely to seek candidates who will be more aggressive in dealing with the problem.

This is how a city elects a mayor like Giuliani in New York or Rick Riordan in LA, both of whom ran on platforms of dealing with petty crime and ""broken windows.""    Murray probably senses that this is the direction to which the wind is shifting and wants to get ahead of it.   The environment is getting ripe for someone like Mark Sidran to run on the ""I told you so"" platform.

If things are still as bad in 2017 as they are today, the candidate who appears to be the toughest on petty crime and lawlessness will likely be the one who wins.

RCW 70.160.075
Smoking prohibited within twenty-five feet of public places or places of employment—Application to modify presumptively reasonable minimum distance.

Smoking is prohibited within a presumptively reasonable minimum distance of twenty-five feet from entrances, exits, windows that open, and ventilation intakes that serve an enclosed area where smoking is prohibited so as to ensure that tobacco smoke does not enter the area through entrances, exits, open windows, or other means. Owners, operators, managers, employers, or other persons who own or control a public place or place of employment may seek to rebut the presumption that twenty-five feet is a reasonable minimum distance by making application to the director of the local health department or district in which the public place or place of employment is located. The presumption will be rebutted if the applicant can show by clear and convincing evidence that, given the unique circumstances presented by the location of entrances, exits, windows that open, ventilation intakes, or other factors, smoke will not infiltrate or reach the entrances, exits, open windows, or ventilation intakes or enter into such public place or place of employment and, therefore, the public health and safety will be adequately protected by a lesser distance.

"Both Mayor Gregor Robertson and uber condo marketer Bob Rennie, a key Robertson supporter, have come out in favour of imposing a housing speculation tax as a means to dampen the influence of investors in Vancouver’s red-hot real estate market.

At the end of a week that saw headlines about millennials being driven out of the city by high property prices, Robertson revealed that he has called on Premier Christy Clark to consider measures to get at the rising concern over foreign investment in the market.

“We definitely need taxation tools that discourage speculation on real estate,” Robertson said in an emailed statement Friday.

“Vancouver needs the B.C. Government to take action on creating a speculation tax and recognize that we need a fair and level playing field to make housing more affordable for residents in Vancouver, and throughout the province.”

Robertson made the statement the same day Rennie offered the same opinion in his annual luncheon speech to the Urban Development Institute, as part of a discussion about “getting the elephant in the room out on the table” with the issues driving the increasing unaffordability of Vancouver real estate.

“It’s speculation we should be concerned about,” Rennie said. “The conversations aren’t about foreign investment, the conversation is about China. That’s the elephant in the room.”

Rennie said the unaffordability of Vancouver real estate is becoming a “potentially toxic” situation, but in his much-anticipated address argued that the public and officials need to come to grips with affordability, which can’t be achieved by hanging on to single-family zoning in the city with the most expensive land in Canada.

Instead, Rennie believes the focus should be on creating higher-density housing forms that younger families find acceptable.

He brought up the idea of a speculation tax when he raised the question of whether government should tax foreign investment in real estate, which is increasingly being seen by the public as a key force driving detached-home prices over the $1 million mark, sparking heated debates over how to dampen its influence.

He said foreign investment is just one of many factors driving up prices; others include a diminishing supply of single-family homes, population growth and the transfer of wealth from baby boomers to their millennial children.

And Rennie argued taxing foreign investment in real estate would send the wrong message to trade partners such as India and Indonesia, without solving the affordability problem. If governments were willing to tax foreign investment in housing, maybe they would be willing to tax investment in the technology or manufacturing sectors.

Rennie suggested a speculation tax on a sliding scale, based on how soon a speculative buyer attempts to flip property after a purchase, in addition to the 23½-per-cent capital gains tax.

“I’m leaning in this direction for two reasons, “Rennie said. “I hate the racist undertone that is rampant out there, so I think we need a visible, measurable gesture.”

Secondly, Rennie said if speculative investment is a big contributor to unaffordability, “lets repatriate some of that money back to first time buyers.”

Money collected could be paid out as grants to first-time buyers who can prove they don’t have other help to make a down payment.

In a scrum after his speech, Rennie also argued that a tax on foreign buyers likely wouldn’t deter wealthy buyers.

“Do you think a $100,000 tax on a $3 million home is going to stop someone from buying it?",,,,TheRealRacketear,,,1452713756,t5_2qhad,t3_40tjet,t3_40tjet,21,1454469708,0,0,cywz0su,Seattle,21,,

"What this article highlights were the few (albeit loud) individuals who shouted from the back of the room and were generally disruptive and obscene. Those people were by no means representative of the majority of attendees who were respectful, responding when appropriate with clapping/cheering and - yes - booing at times.

What the article DOESN'T EVEN MENTION was that it was repeatedly expressed by the organizers (who were speaking on behalf of the community) that there is a distinction between RV residents who are living on the streets and honestly lack housing/services, and those who are using RVs as a home base for a variety of criminal activity that has been repeatedly witnessed, documented, and reported - with no response by SPD or the Mayor's office. The article doesn't mention that it was expressed over and over by more than one organizer that the homeless are victims of the criminal activity just like the rest of the community is, that the focus of the meeting was to address public safety (for all) in neighborhoods that are seeing a rapid rise in criminal activity that didn't exist before the RV chop-shops and drug dens moved in. The article doesn't mention the response by the majority of the crowd of applause and shouts of ""yes!"" when Mike O'Brien asked if they would support official RV parking lots designated by the city *even if* they were located in their own backyards like many of the tent cities are.

"I'll try to explain it the best I can. Cultural heritage can encompass many elements of one's personal and group identity: religion, language, dress, arts, traditions, food, etc. Cultural heritage is often eroded by things like globalization, cultural appropriation, ""whitewashing,"" and forced cultural suppression. Examples would be things like whitewashing an area's history to eliminate contributions from other cultures, the Native ""boarding schools"" all over the world where indigenous people's children were taken to make them ""white,"" and the cultural appropriation from African American, Indian, and Native American cultures conflating actual cultural knowledge and history. As a result, many cultural groups have begun more actively promoting cultural heritage within the group and defensively curating it against external influence. Native Americans are pushing children to learn their tribal languages and voicing objections to mainstream use of native sacred objects like head dresses in fashion. Indians do the same with bindis and the finally departed fad of using Hindu imagery out-of-context in fashion. 

In the South, African Americans have a very unique and vibrant culture, but it is also exposed to being eroded by the same elements above. African American churches have been made famous by movies like Blues Brothers, but if droves of whites started attending, it wouldn't be due to a connection to the denomination. It would be as a form of entertainment, for music and excitement. A spiritual practice would be deluded as part of a show (similarly faced by African Voudun especially in NOLA). In neighborhoods like the 9th Ward in NOLA (I lived around NOLA, so I focus there bc most familiar with it) are being bought up by white transplants. African American traditions like [skeleton gangs](http://www.nola.com/mardigras/index.ssf/2014/03/north_side_skull_bones_gang_ke.html) and [Mardi Gras Indians](http://www.mardigrasneworleans.com/mardigrasindians.html) are being usurped by these newcomers with no regard for what they mean to the African American community. Now you see tweenagers with skull outfits, cause it looks cool. 

I guess in short, and IMO, cultural preservation is when a culture merely asks for the right to continued existence. That said, friends who have married into black families and friends as guests are often welcome, and if someone was part of that community long enough, they'd be accepted. Lots of whites attend the MGI parade, but they aren't part of the crew. A friend whose husband is Apache attends events on the reservation, etc. It doesn't mean that all whites under all circumstances are forbidden in the way Jim Crowe functioned for blacks. What it does mean is that seemingly ""exotic"" cultural practices have the right to belong to a group and exist in peace without becoming entertainment for white spectators and assimilators bored with their own culture. 

Racism, on the other hand, is beyond just asking for one's own right to exist. As much as white supremacists or NBP claim to just be protecting their existence or whatever, it's a sham. They are seeking to separate themselves from otherness at any expense to others. They're threatened by the mere co-existence of others. Without cultural preservation by marginalized groups, a lot of that culture would have been deconstructed by narcissistic white groups.

"Look at a map of our city. We live on a narrow north/south isthmus. At its narrowest point it is barely 2.5 miles across. Right at this narrowest point is the 30th busiest port in the US, *and* two sports stadiums that can hold a combined 120,000 fans. At the north end of the tunnel you have Key Arena and McCaw hall, which combined hold over 20,000, and all of South Lake Union which is growing like crazy. We have one of the fastest-growing populations in the US at &gt; 2%/year (in 2013-2014 it was the #1 fastest-growing city).

"I really wish someone would approach the issue of homeless from a freakonomics angle.  Whenever this topic is discussed, it seems like we carefully talk around the basic question of: ""What is it that these homeless people actually want?""

We assume they want mental health assistance. Do they?  

We assume they want job training.  Do they?  

We assume they want a 9 to 5 job which pays them enough to pay rent in a modest accommodation. Do they?  

I suspect that any homeless person has learned the approved ""PR"" answers to questions from sympathetic reporters which center around health issues and/or being down on one's luck, but what if the simple answer is actually the correct one?  People are homeless because they choose to be this way, and it suits them.

What then?  What should the city do to help those who are indifferent to receiving said help?  Their actions are a problem, in that they basically see themselves as ""urban campers"" who forage during the early part of the day (aggressive panhandling, strong arm assaults, some smash and grab thefts); then take advantage of every city program they can which feeds and clothes them, and spends their nights using the money they ""foraged"" to by booze and drugs.  

Here is what I suspect the vast majority of homeless want:  No responsibilities, no job, as much food as they want to eat, drugs, and booze.  They can rely on the city for a lot of this, but not the booze and drugs... for that they must ""Forage.""  The ""Foraging"" and the left over waste littering the ground from their lifestyle becomes a community problem.  

No responsible person feels ok when they pay their dues in life by working hard to go to good schools, pay off their student loans, get a job in a responsible field, and then have to step over a fecal covered smelly man who is furiously masturbating outside the front door of the apartment building that he and his wife and kids live in.   The homeless man has a mental issue?  The homeless man has a drug issue?  This is not the immediate problem.  The immediate problem is the foul, dangerous, masturbating man that is in close proximity to your loved ones.  You can call the police, but they won't come.  You can call an ambulance, but they will spot your deception right away and ask you for more information about the medical issue (and not come).

Responsible people just want to know, where can I live in this city where I won't have my family's safety threatened by those who are intent on theft, mayhem, and violence?  Please, I beg of you.  Please tell me where the rule of law prevails, because I want to live there.  The last redoubts were probably thought to have been Magnolia and Ballard but nope, we can't have that!  The city is actively busing homeless into camps in those regions, and are not enforcing all the RV vagrancy.  Some lady was beat to death in interbay a few months ago by a homeless man and the response from the city was a collective yawn.

People are tired of being victims, first by the homeless who commit act after act of crime without thought of who they are hurting, then by the SPD which are utterly indifferent to their pleas for help, and finally by those that are legitimately sympathetic to the ""good homeless"" but find their way of defending the ""good homeless"" by attacking those who are victimized by the ""regular homeless.""

In our city a homeless man can walk up to your house and stare right in the front window at your wife, your children, and all of your possessions  for an hour.  Just swigging on a beer in a brown paper bag while he plays pocket pool.   You can call the police and they will not come.  You can complain about it and you will be labeled a paranoid hater of those that are ""just down on their luck.""  How did we get this way?  How can this lunacy be tolerated?  The good people in neighborhoods have been victimized enough that they have ran out of options... no typical path of redress has been successful, and their pleas of support have only served to make them feel ashamed that they want to protect themselves.

&gt;The CD has decent public transit, while the suburbs people are being forced into have none, increasing cost of living further, and decreasing quality of life. 

[Tell that to the large black communities in federal way who bailed on the CD years ago, they are all really upset about it.](http://www.seattleweekly.com/2003-01-22/news/an-acquired-taste-for-the-suburbs/)

Just kidding, people like having a community and being away from the gangs and crime.

&gt;For 40 years, black people have been arrested and put into the criminal justice system on the exact corner Ikes is set up on. While this speaker was growing up, there were two SPD vans that profiled the black students of Garfield and Nova High Schools, taking photographs from afar and trying to find dirt on them in the form of weed usage. Now, Ike is a very white and corporate attempt to corner the market. He illegally bought the license from someone that won the state's permit lottery, pushed the ban of weed stores in downtown, supported ending medical marijuana, and built an arcade next to a planned competitor in Capitol Hill, making it too close to children, despite the church right next to Ike's in the CD with sunday school (since only white NIMBYs push that kind of zoning regulation). Ikes heard this, smirking the whole time, then said ""I have nothing to say,"" and left. His branding is very aesthetically pleasing and fits right in with gentrification, comfortable for the new wealthy folks to use.

holy conspiracy theories! Of course it makes the most sense that Ian is a cartoonishly evil super villain who has it out for a neighborhood that's former tourist attractions included two shooting galleries ( now just one!) and a 24 hour gold buyer.

&gt; The speakers noted all the 40+ year old family-owned businesses that have recently been forced out of existence, and the livelihoods of the people behind them. Meanwhile, in the past two years since the speaker has moved back to Seattle, she's been stopped by police while walking in the CD six times, wearing jeans and a hoodie. Once the officers realized she was a 45 year old woman, not a teenage black boy, they stop interrogating, and she thinks, ""Well what if I were? Why does just being a black young man require your attention?""

Neighbors have asked for more police presence in the neighborhood and a crackdown on gang activities like the uptick in random shootings?

&gt; All people want safe and aesthetically pleasing neighborhoods they can walk at all hours, but under our system that lacks affordable public housing, gentrification forces people out of their home, replaced by the children of the folks that locked them in to it. If those six story mixed use buildings were for the people of the neighborhood, there'd be no conflict.

"I like how the end of the article suggests the voters are hypocritical for being mad about illegal homeless activity but won't vote for tent cities.  Wtf.

I live very close to the hub of Lake City and see this shit all the time. People smoking crack and shooting up in public, litter, piss and shit in doorways, terribly crafted tagging, public intoxication, cat calling.  Also property crime up here is fucking insane.  If your shit is not bolted down consider it boosted.  

I'd like to provide a quick example of the difficulty of not profiling and stereotyping:

A dude with one shoe and pissed soaked pants (I smelled them), with wild desheveled hair and no teeth walks right past two cop cars at LCW and 125.  The homeless man is carrying a shiny almost new Stihl weed wacker on his shoulder and a 22 oz of steel reserve in his other.  The weed wacker is almost certainly stolen. The cops just watched him walk by and drove off through the light and down the highway.  How the fuck?


I would remind the Stranger that I pay property taxes to the City for them to do their job.  It's not my job to solve this, it's the cities.  Are they really suggesting that NIMBYism is the reason for the problems with homelessness? 

I'd argue it's an inefficiently run police force and social services department.  Now they are being called out and everyone is confused as to how to feel.  Why the fuck are people being chastised for being concerned about feeling unsafe in their city?

"What makes the city ""smart""? People here have been voting down smart, forward-thinking transit plans for generations now.

For almost 50 years now, Seattleites have [voted down](http://seattlish.com/post/83663717975/on-blast-90-years-of-fucked-up-seattle-public) any efforts to make modern, functional, forwarding thinking programs to create transit and better transit infrastructure. 

* In 1968, voters approved the Kingdome, but rejected transit  

* In [1970](http://www.seattletimes.com/business/economy/the-mass-transit-system-seattle-might-have-had-jon-talton/), voters rejected four transit-related bonds, causing the federal government to reroute transit aid to Atlanta instead of here.  

* In [1972](http://metro.kingcounty.gov/am/history/history-1970.html) voters allow a small transit tax for busses, but reject the tax for electric rail. (Even the meager vote for busses was the first time Seattleites approved new taxes for transit since 1918)  

* In [1995](http://metro.kingcounty.gov/am/history/history-1990.html), voters reject a Regional Transit Authority (later Sound Transit) measure for a gigantic, $6.7 billion transportation system over three counties that would’ve featured commuter rail, light rail, express buses, and expanded HOV lanes 

* In 1999, with Initiative 695, local voters show their love of Tim Eyman and regressivism- scrapping the progressive car excise fee for a super-regressive $30 state car tabs. Since 29% of the vehicle excise tax went to local transit, local communities have been scrambling to keep their buses running ever since. 

* In 2002, voters showed their hatred of forward-thinking transit/infrastructure funding and support an Eyman initiative yet again: voters approved I-776,which restricted local governments from adding their own excise taxes and limited local license tab fees. While the measure was shot down at first for being unconstitutional, it was upheld by the State Supreme Court in October 2003. 776 repealed many taxes that the public had [already voted on](https://researchcouncil.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/initiative776.pdf)  

* In [2005](http://www.seattlepi.com/local/transportation/article/Monorail-will-go-to-voters-for-5th-time-1183631.php), Mayor Nickels gets the ""all-or-nothing"" plan for a West Seattle-Ballard monorail on the ballot. The plan is a watered down, poor version of the original, so it failed. Its rejection gutted Seattle Monorail Partners, which had been working to upgrade our transit system since they were created by a public vote in 1997. Council President Jan Drago (accurately) expressed fear that not building the monorail segment means ""we will pass it to future generations."" **Now look where we are!** 

* In [2011](http://seattlest.com/2011/07/13/last_night_people_are_voting_with_t.php): The Congestion Reduction Fee. When our regressive and outdated sales tax revenue plummets during the recession – the King County Council approves a $20 fee on vehicle tabs to make up the $60 million deficit, collected in 2012  through 2014  

* In [2014](http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/with-transit-money-approved-seattle-pledges-to-spend-new-dollars-well/), Seattleites vote *FOR* maintaining some bus transit, with more regressive taxes - a $60 car-tab fee and a 0.1 percent sales-tax increase - to keep many bus lines from being cut and to expand services on a couple bus lines. 


Doesn't sound too smart to me! Plus, people here support the nation's most regressive tax structure - and an inadequate, outdated one at that. 

Just think where we could be now if voters hadn't rejected mass transit on multiple occasions and hadn't supported regressive taxation and Tim Eyman's anti-transit, anti-infrastructure initiatives. ",,,,BillyDBilliams,,,1453273291,t5_2qhad,t3_41sb3c,t1_cz4sbrp,32,1454607769,0,0,cz4yocc,Seattle,32,,

"/u/Klaxon5 does raise a valid point, if we were suddenly flooded with huge numbers of homeless people coming in from the rest of the country, the funding and other resources couldn't keep pace with demand and it would collapse. I just really doubt that would happen. Utah has had considerable success with this approach already, with no signs of great influxes of homeless people. In general, long term homeless people are mostly mentally ill or homeless by choice, so housing them is expensive generally. The others, the short term homeless, don't require nearly so many resources, and are the vast majority, so housing them temporarily is fairly cheap and makes a tremendous difference. The ROI is pretty hefty. In Utah they found it costs ~$17,000/year/person for medical needs, jail time, etc that comes with indigent people. By contrast, housing them cost $11,000/year/person and was a shorter term cost on average.",,,,theJigmeister,,,1453361486,t5_2qhad,t3_41wm1r,t1_cz66ybs,15,1454630541,0,0,cz6a2zf,Seattle,15,,

"Hey OP!

I was at the North Gate Ram this evening and was able to speak to a waitress about this, let me provide the breakdown of the charge and who it goes to as she explained it to me:

Let's say: $50 tab and the 19% Service Charge

0.19 × $50 = $9.50

Of that $9.50, 70% goes to Employees of the establishment and 30% to The Ram.

Of the 70% that is distributed to the employees, 50% goes to the waitress that served us and 20% to the cooks, bussers, etc. (Not sure if this also translates to bartenders). This means that our lovely server receives 35% of the original Service Charge. 

So, our waitress receives $3.33 and The Ram receives $2.85 with everyone else sharing $0.45.

In a perfect world, I believe that these jobs would support a living wage with tips being merely a gesture of kindness and gratitude.

"This is absurdly short sighted.

We already have a massive shortage of primary care physicians, and this is only going to make the problem worse.  Paying medical school graduates minimum wage after they've spent 8+ years and accrued an average of $175K in debt is absolutely rediculous.  With an interest rate of 6% (Federal rates are 5.84%) it would take 10 years paying $2,000 / month to pay off that loan.

Except newly graduated Dr.s *can't* pay off their loan because they're payed $13-$17/hour for the first 3 to 5 years.  The take home pay for $60,000 is ~4k/mo.  Interest payment alone is ~$900/mo, reducing takehome pay to $3.1k/mo (which averaged over the 80/week residents make is ~$9/hour in pay). If you take the short rout, you wind up in a field that doesn't pay anywhere near the top end, and will likely make sub 200k.

"they're all good options. you'll find things to like and dislike about all of them. try them out for yourself. the 3 main seattle resorts to visit are crystal, stevens, and snoqualmie.

crystal has amazing long runs but i don't find good tree runs. i ride there when i want a good free ride fast and long day. beautiful. about 2 hours from seattle

stevens has shorter runs but amazing terrain, same time from seattle as crystal at about 2 hours. you can bust through powder in trees all day (on a good day), some great back country and out of bounds areas (know what you're doing). tunnel creek? yeehaw. (again, know what you're doing http://www.nytimes.com/projects/2012/snow-fall/#/?part=tunnel-creek ). i love stevens on a snowboard but the short runs and long lines always leave me wanting to be at crystal

snoqualmie is the retarded step child of skiing in the area. it's 45 minutes away which is a big bonus, but the terrain is short, it rains more often than it snows. great for quick night skiing as its easy to get back and forth quick to town. but also all the moms from the eastside drop their kids off for the day here so be prepared for 15 year old douches with no supervision on your short runs and your long lift lines. 

alpental is snoqualmie but a little bit better terrain. don't let anyone tell you any different.

baker has great snow. but confusing lift crossovers that freak you out after you down a bottle of jagermeister and cause you to fly out of the sky towards the ground quick (your mileage may vary). baker is awesome, but the distance from seattle makes it fun to check out but not a good regular resort to visit. i do forever hate their extended tall lift slides at the top of the chairs, fuck those things to death.

mission ridge can be great fun. smaller than other mountains and the chairs always need upgrading, but a chance to get more of a powder type snow. much longer drive so also would recommend at least a nights stay to appreciate it 

whistler? whistler and blackcomb in canada are world class ski areas and should be visited. make a weekend out of it at the minimum.  looooooooong runs, beautiful varying country, and two entire mountains to explore. glorious. 4-5 hour drive. i like to go there for a week with a housefull of friends

mt hood is another one that's great fun to ride at, a couple ski resorts there, all worth checking out. but again, make a weekend out of it at the minimum because of the distance

"So I was at the event today but didn't participate, here are a few random parts of the event I remember. The basic overview of this was that the counter protesters rallied in a semicircle around the Trump people (both of them) and had one speaker speak at a time. They did open the floor up at the end so the Trump people could speak. The creator of the event got up and said ""I brought some snacks, would you guys like some?"" and then sat back down.

First  a video I found of people heading towards the event: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I24MydsmHI8

I would say about 80% of the counter-protesters we either quiet or actually polite, but there were some really mean people among them as well. One person gave a speech where she screamed into the face of the guy who started the rally, calling him a ""Punk ass bitch"" and something like ""you are not even smart enough to realize how fucking stupid you are.""

Another speaker opened his speech with a loud shout of ""FUCK THE POLICE!"" which the crowd mostly agreed with.

Towards the end of the event I listened to the organizer of the counter protest give an interview claiming that the guy who started the event was encouraging people to bring guns and hopefully use them which made her feel unsafe on campus. I was on the Facebook page for the event quite a bit and can say that he wasn't doing this (someone jokingly asked if the event was open-carry which might have prompted this). Most of the complaints the protesters had about the so called Facebook harassment stemmed from them going onto the page saying something like ""Trump supporters are all idiots"" and getting mad when someone responded to them. I saw no use of the ""N"" word but some guy did say faggot after someone told him you can't say that word. The guy who did that wasn't at the event.

Also at the end the creator of the event was talking to some people who were saying the reason they were mad at him was not that he said anything especially bad, they admitted that he didn't. They were mad because he was not deleting the comments they didn't like. He said he wasn't deleting any comments pro or anti-Trump and that people should be responsible for their own comments.

The event finally ended after police requested the creator of the event leave when one guy nearly got violent with him because he supposedly told a woman on the Facebook page to ""Jerk off Adolf Hitler"". One woman, a protester, had the quite funny reaction to do the jerking off hand motion and say ""hell yeah I would jerk off Hitler, I would jerk his little dick right off"". He actually asked the cop to arrest him for that.

I spoke to both the creator of the event (guy on the left) and the other guy (guy on the right). The guy on the right said he wasn't even political, never posted on the page, and just went there to see what would happen. The main guy said he was hoping just to have some people show up and eat snacks and discuss politics, but that he thought it was funny how much effort people put in to protest his non-event.

The guy who was there supporting Sanders kind of officially (he was handing out stickers) apologized for the behavior of the people who were getting over the top and thanked them for coming out in spite of the backlash.

Also, according to to the creator, his job has been called twice now by people demanding he be fired and there is a movement to have him expelled from the university.

If you go by [the Telegraph (UK)](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/9414540/A-history-of-mass-shootings-in-the-US-since-Columbine.html)'s list of notable mass shootings since Columbine in 1999, 5 successfully interdicted (potential) mass shootings accounts for a success rate of 14% - or less than that if you factor in the two years between 1997 (when the Post started tabulating armed good samaritan cases) and 1999 (Columbine). Furthermore, if you consider that [one in three Americans own a gun](http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/one-three-americans-own-guns-culture-factor-study-finds-n384031), that seems like an alarmingly low success rate considering how often the armed good samaritan trope is trotted out by pro-gun media as a panacea for mass shootings in the States. In fact, it's a lower success rate than [accidental shootings by children alone in 2015](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/toddlers-shot-victim-week-2015-article-1.2398377), let alone accidental shootings by stupid but otherwise law-abiding adults.

"I love the gyro salad at Aladdin Gyrocery in the U District.  Pick it up, and it weighs a ton.  It's tangy, it's crunchy, it's cold and hot.  It's salty and meaty and feta cheesy.  It's fresh.  And best of all, unless you're *really* hungry, you'll get a nice second meal out of it.  It's about $10, but it's totally worth it to me.

I also enjoy the decadence of the seafood platter.  Seattle's oldest restaurant, The Athenian Inn in the Market, has a fried platter that will satisfy your fried seafood desires.  Twas at the Athenian that I first supped on deep-fried salmon, a new twist on an old favorite.  A little to the south, in Pioneer Square, is FX Mccrory's.  It's an Irish pub on steroids.  Though, I think these days it may be a shadow of its former, generous incarnation, their cold seafood platter was...well....decadent is the best word to describe digging through an exotic pile of cold delicacies using mostly just your fingers.

So, gyro salads and seafood platters for dinner.  Dessert is cheap and easy.  The Metropolitan Market in Lower Queen Anne, just off Mercer, bakes something they call ""the cookie.""

I am not arguing right or wrong here, just that when you compel people to do something good, they will get less satisfaction from it than if they made the choice to do it themselves.

Also, the restaurant added a service charge with a note saying it is to offset costs, but unlike a gratuity proper, it isn't necessarily going to make it to the waitstaff as higher wages.

"I'm not too sure there's a wrong time. Example.

Q: So /r/personalfinance, my sister has made yet another attempt on my life in anticipation of our mothers impending passing due to her long struggle with MS, how do I secure my portion of the inheritance without breaking the clause she's written in concerning the necessity of her children's need to maintain friendly relations until the 25 year trust is paid?

A: As a former SR-71 pilot, and a professional keynote speaker, the question I'm most often asked is ""How fast would that SR-71 fly?"" I can be assured of hearing that question several times at any event I attend. It's an interesting question, given the aircraft's proclivity for speed, but there really isn't one number to give, as the jet would always give you a little more speed if you wanted it to. It was common to see 35 miles a minute. Because we flew a programmed Mach number on most missions, and never wanted to harm the plane in any way, we never let it run out to any limits of temperature or speed. 

Thus, each SR-71 pilot had his own individual “high” speed that he saw at some point on some mission. I saw mine over Libya when Khadafy fired two missiles my way, and max power was in order. Let’s just say that the plane truly loved speed and effortlessly took us to Mach numbers we hadn’t previously seen. So it was with great surprise, when at the end of one of my presentations, someone asked, “what was the slowest you ever flew the Blackbird?” This was a first. After giving it some thought, I was reminded of a story that I had never shared before, and relayed the following. I was flying the SR-71 out of RAF Mildenhall, England , with my back-seater, Walt Watson; we were returning from a mission over Europe and the Iron Curtain when we received a radio transmission from home base. As we scooted across Denmark in three minutes, we learned that a small RAF base in the English countryside had requested an SR-71 fly-past. 

The air cadet commander there was a former Blackbird pilot, and thought it would be a motivating moment for the young lads to see the mighty SR-71 perform a low approach. No problem, we were happy to do it. After a quick aerial refueling over the North Sea , we proceeded to find the small airfield. Walter had a myriad of sophisticated navigation equipment in the back seat, and began to vector me toward the field. Descending to subsonic speeds, we found ourselves over a densely wooded area in a slight haze. Like most former WWII British airfields, the one we were looking for had a small tower and little surrounding infrastructure. Walter told me we were close and that I should be able to see the field, but I saw nothing. Nothing but trees as far as I could see in the haze. We got a little lower, and I pulled the throttles back from 325 knots we were at. With the gear up, anything under 275 was just uncomfortable. Walt said we were practically over the field—yet; there was nothing in my windscreen. 

I banked the jet and started a gentle circling maneuver in hopes of picking up anything that looked like a field. Meanwhile, below, the cadet commander had taken the cadets up on the catwalk of the tower in order to get a prime view of the fly-past. It was a quiet, still day with no wind and partial gray overcast. Walter continued to give me indications that the field should be below us but in the overcast and haze, I couldn't see it.. The longer we continued to peer out the window and circle, the slower we got. With our power back, the awaiting cadets heard nothing. I must have had good instructors in my flying career, as something told me I better cross-check the gauges. As I noticed the airspeed indicator slide below 160 knots, my heart stopped and my adrenalin-filled left hand pushed two throttles full forward. At this point we weren't really flying, but were falling in a slight bank. 

Just at the moment that both afterburners lit with a thunderous roar of flame (and what a joyous feeling that was) the aircraft fell into full view of the shocked observers on the tower. Shattering the still quiet of that morning, they now had 107 feet of fire-breathing titanium in their face as the plane leveled and accelerated, in full burner, on the tower side of the infield, closer than expected, maintaining what could only be described as some sort of ultimate knife-edge pass. Quickly reaching the field boundary, we proceeded back to Mildenhall without incident. We didn't say a word for those next 14 minutes. After landing, our commander greeted us, and we were both certain he was reaching for our wings. 

Instead, he heartily shook our hands and said the commander had told him it was the greatest SR-71 fly-past he had ever seen, especially how we had surprised them with such a precise maneuver that could only be described as breathtaking. He said that some of the cadet’s hats were blown off and the sight of the plan form of the plane in full afterburner dropping right in front of them was unbelievable. Walt and I both understood the concept of “breathtaking” very well that morning, and sheepishly replied that they were just excited to see our low approach. As we retired to the equipment room to change from space suits to flight suits, we just sat there-we hadn't spoken a word since “the pass.”

*If the TBM does stall under the Federal Building—or any one of the 390 downtown buildings it will pass under or near—a five-story-wide chasm would have to be opened in a downtown street to the depth of the stalled machine. Then a tunnel would have to be dug sideways to the stalled machine. Then the soil above this second tunnel would have to be shored up, to protect the buildings above, and only then could the broken TBM be lifted out and a new TBM lowered down into the hole—a new machine that could also break down*.

Either way they accepted a responsibly (by getting behind the wheel) in which failure is known to cause the death of others, then failed to uphold that responsibility, leading to another's death.

"""It's amazon........."" as an excuse for things being shitty is something I hear a lot of from the old timers. It seems like upper management is slowly getting it.

Paternity leave is something that no one ever thought would happen. They're rolling out computers that aren't complete shit like we had before, almost like they realize that spending 3k so your 120k+ dev is more productive actually makes sense, adding game/art rooms in the new building (albeit a single room for each). The new ""you don't have to stay a year after transferring"" policy is amazing and a huge plus for retention imo. If you hate your team, find a new one. Before it was ""if you hate your team and haven't been here a year, fuck you"".

To be a top employer instead of a stepping stone to google/fb/et al, we need to be more competitive on pay and have a better culture for retaining people. We bleed our best people to other companies because we can't match the pay. It's not all about money, but we have people getting offers for literally 2x more than they make currently. We also need managers to stop burning people out-- the new transfer policy REALLY HELPS with this.

"I'm loyal Alaska flier, Gold MVP last four years.  They treat me quite well.  The problem is how the rest of the industry treats Alaska.  When I get outside of Alaska's own footprint I might as well be shit on a stick flying bumfuck Air.  Nobody out in the world has ever heard of the airline, the codeshares are very one-way (Alaska treats its Delta/American codeshares as priority board, but nobody reciprocates)... 

I like Alaska but the fact is unless you are regularly only staying on the West Coast and select routes east, you're going to be a second class citizen in the bigger airports they go to, and if anything goes wrong they treat you as an unstatus freeloader not someone they give a shit about.  They = Delta and American, in theory Alaska's allies.

The thing is Alaska does still offer full points based off of miles, they're literally about the last airline that does that.  Delta et al switched their loyalty programs to dollar values last year or earlier, the net result is it's harder to achieve status.

So I'll stick out Alaska another year.  I love their service and I am a believer that having a home town ""flagship"" airline is a good thing for the region and for your travel quality in general.  I watched what Delta's colonization of Northwests' footprint did to service out of MSP and DET.  Really do not want to see SeaTac turn into another Delta hub, but unless a bunch of people rally around the flag, I suspect that's what we're seeing, a slow takeover by Delta that'll one day just end in a stock deal that Alaska's forced to take.",,,,my_lucid_nightmare,Capitol Hill,,1453829058,t5_2qhad,t3_42s87w,t3_42s87w,45,1454743229,0,0,czcq6v5,Seattle,45,,flair

"Okay, I was with it.

Here's the deal.

The CD has historically been a redlined, black-only neighborhood. Right now, $1800 studio apartments are going up built for white people, forcing black homeowners out through property taxes. As one of the speakers said, (paraphrased) ""when I left my home a decade ago, there wasn't a single black family on my block. I moved back to my childhood home from Europe, and now I'm the only black person on the block"". The CD has decent public transit, while the suburbs people are being forced into have none, increasing cost of living further, and decreasing quality of life. For 40 years, black people have been arrested and put into the criminal justice system on the exact corner Ikes is set up on. While this speaker was growing up, there were two SPD vans that profiled the black students of Garfield and Nova High Schools, taking photographs from afar and trying to find dirt on them in the form of weed usage. Now, Ike is a very white and corporate attempt to corner the market. He illegally bought the license from someone that won the state's permit lottery, pushed the ban of weed stores in downtown, supported ending medical marijuana, and built an arcade next to a planned competitor in Capitol Hill, making it too close to children, despite the church right next to Ike's in the CD with sunday school (since only white NIMBYs push that kind of zoning regulation). Ikes heard this, smirking the whole time, then said ""I have nothing to say,"" and left. His branding is very aesthetically pleasing and fits right in with gentrification, comfortable for the new wealthy folks to use. 

The speakers noted all the 40+ year old family-owned businesses that have recently been forced out of existence, and the livelihoods of the people behind them. Meanwhile, in the past two years since the speaker has moved back to Seattle, she's been stopped by police while walking in the CD six times, wearing jeans and a hoodie. Once the officers realized she was a 45 year old woman, not a teenage black boy, they stop interrogating, and she thinks, ""Well what if I were? Why does just being a black young man require your attention?""

After that, a group of First Nations musicians spoke, advocating that this land is ultimately borrowed, respect for the planet through those lovely purple trolley busses, and thanked and recognized the Duwamish in native language. 

All people want safe and aesthetically pleasing neighborhoods they can walk at all hours, but under our system that lacks affordable public housing, gentrification forces people out of their home, replaced by the children of the folks that locked them in to it. If those six story mixed use buildings were for the people of the neighborhood, there'd be no conflict.

It was an emotional and powerful event. Made me tear up several times.

"I think income inequality is a major issue in this country and support the push for more paid sick leave, but I can't support a statewide $13.50/hour minimum wage. Once you adjust for cost of living, Washington state is already home to the highest minimum wage in the nation. According to [smartasset.com](https://smartasset.com/mortgage/the-cities-with-the-highest-and-lowest-real-minimum-wage#q=minimum wage) the top 3 metro areas with the highest minimum wage (after adjusting for cost of living) are the Tri-Cities (Kennewick, Pasco, &amp; Richland), Spokane, and Yakima. According to [MIT's Living Wage](http://livingwage.mit.edu/states/53/locations) project, Washington state's current minimum wage provides a living wage for a single adult in 21 out of Washington's 39 counties. You can see this data visually on the [living wage map](http://storymaps.esri.com/stories/2015/living-wage-map/). Washington state is the only state in the USA where this is true. This is the case because we passed [I-688](http://www.smartvoter.org/1998nov/wa/state/meas/i688/) in November 1998, which stated: 

&gt;the state minimum wage be increased from $4.90 to $5.70 in 1999 and $6.50 in 2000, and afterwards be annually adjusted for inflation

In other words, we already did this 18 years ago. And we were the first in the nation to index it to inflation. The reason it was indexed was so we'd solve the problem once and for all, without having to pass a new law every few years chasing inflation like the federal government does.

When you take that stance, eventually over time the bar gets raised so high you start to exclude people who are damn good or even great at what they do, because they don't fit some obscure aspect of the profile someone at HR is looking for.

So you wind up passing on many good people due to a perception that, IMHO, few people in HR at the companies I've worked for could explain.

Cops don't patrol a inch more ground for a minute longer than they have to anymore. This makes response time worse because most of your patrol units are either, quit literally, hiding, or they're just cruising from 911 call to 911 call, which confines them mainly to arterials. Another active part of depolicing is treating any non-emergency call as something that can wait, with the hope that it will have resolved itself by time a cop gets there.

"all I know is, the elephant was in the zoo and not dying, until the conflict was caused by the do-gooders pushing the zoo into action.

All hindsight now, but in general in most situations, when a do-gooder starts pushing people into action, there will be unintended consequences, oftentimes worse than the original issue the do-gooder was lobbying to address in the first place.

Exactly how this one played out.

So fuck the zoo for pawning the elephant off on another zoo, but fuck the do-gooders more.  Had they not gotten their granny panties in a knot, the elephant would still presumably be living in Woodland park, Woodland park would have agreed never to own another elephant, Chai would have lived out her life and that would have been that.

But no.

"Aww, hell...

I met Dick Spady once, a few years back. I was doing a project for a graduate leadership course, and he agreed to let us interview him. He gave us over an hour of his time. He came across as one of the most gracious, generous, community-minded people I've ever met. He really believed that a business has an obligation to give back to the community it's a part of. He got the concept that if you treat your employees right, they will repay you with loyalty and extra efforts that will make your business shine. He was paying his counter help and burger-flippers well above the industry standard, and offering full- and part-timers benefits (health insurance, scholarships, help with childcare), years before his competitors caught on and got on the bandwagon. He said he thought it helped Dick's attract and keep the best people. I think he was right.

But I think the thing that stuck me the most was what he told us about starting Dick's, back in the early 1950's. There are a lot of parallels between his story and the one about Ray Kroc and McDonald's. Both were WWII veterans. Both came home and watched the baby boom and the automobile culture unfold, and thought that maybe a new kind of restaurant would be a good way to cash in on that. Within a year of each other, they both started drive-in burger joints with simple menus and fast service. But where they diverged was when both businesses took off, and it came time to decide how far to take it. Dick and said he and his then-partners talked about franchising Dick's and expanding beyond the Puget Sound region, but they ultimately decided against it. Getting that big would have meant a lot of travel for them, and that would have taken them away from their families. He said they decided it just wasn't worth it. They were making enough money with just the five Seattle-area locations, and there were other things that were more important to them. Of course, Dick saw how things went for Ray Kroc after he took the other path, but he didn't seem to have any regrets. ENOUGH MONEY...what a concept.

Many of my friends are still current graduate students, who make far less than six figures, and live pretty comfortably for their standards. Most people in Seattle have no clue how frugal most of the rest of the country actually lives - so you probably think that not buying $12 sandwiches every day, ski passes, loads of recreational equipment, new clothes each season, etc. means being ""frugal"".

"Let's put it this way... say you own a business and suddenly your employee productivity drops. You call an employee into your office to find out what you can do and that employee gives you an offer; pay that employee to moonlight for you as a consultant on top of what you pay that employee to do his job in order to get the kind of performance you previously got from that employee. So, now, you're out twice as much money as you paid previously just to get average performance and that employee now has negative incentive to perform their regular job at expected performance levels.

In this case, you have ""security companies"" that are owned by active duty cops that employ active duty cops to work extra hours off duty and now these cops, the same cops who are now responding slowly to calls when they didn't used to, are marketing themselves as a solution to the poor police performance they are accused of doing, only if you pay them extra above what you already pay them to do.

That sounds an awful lot like a scam to me... but even if it's not an intentional scam via intentional work slowdowns that SPD has been known for in the past, how can you expect these cops to have any incentive to do their jobs up to expectation if you're paying them extra for not doing their jobs up to expectation?

Do not move here with no money (hint: whatever you have saved up from a $10.50/hr job at 19 doesn't count as money), no job, and no housing. That's how people end up homeless. 

I doubt most apartments here will rent to someone under 21 (no data to back that up though). Median rental costs are well over $1000 a month. If you want to live in a 'cool' neighborhood that goes up to $1500, and that'll get you an old apartment or a studio.

I've had situations where my inbound out of AMS, we'd have to wait for a gate to open. FWIW, the Airport is aware and are actively planning a new terminal to handle this: http://www.portseattle.org/Business/Construction-Projects/airport-projects/pages/iaf.aspx.

However 4 hours should be plenty of time regardless. The only time it'll be close if your flight is delayed by a hour and all other international flights have arrived just before you have.

The silver lining is that there is a flight to Portland almost every 30 minutes and its considered a 'shuttle' flight. So even if you were to miss it, you'd be on the next one out of Seattle.

"""Assault Weapon"" is a made up term that dates back to the original Assault Weapons Ban.  The problem is that the proponents of the AWB needed to sell it to a solid portion of the gun owning population at the time (ie hunters) with a catchy term that wouldn't get people to dig too hard.  Because if they said ""semi-automatic rifle chambered for .223 or 5.56 with a bayonet mount"" even the hunters would have laughed at them.  Now, they could call it an ""assault rifle ban"" but assault rifles are an actual term with a definition that would have lost support since they're perceived to already be banned so support would also fall apart.  They couldn't ban based on materials as inexpensive hunting rifles use plastic and they couldn't ban on caliber because it would have effectively banned hunting and the AR15 platform can fire multiple different calibers depending on the build.  They also couldn't ban based on the action because while many hunters use bolt-action rifles and pump-action shotguns a significant amount also own semi-automatic rifles for hunting.

This resulted in ""assault weapon"" because it a) sounds close enough to a real term to sound real and b) evokes an image of military types running around.  Most hunters didn't see the necessity of owning firearms like that so they supported the ban and in the process lost their voice in the gun community.",,,,savagemonitor,First Hill,,1452553240,t5_2qhad,t3_40iskn,t1_cyujc2p,12,1454428887,0,0,cyulw2e,Seattle,12,,flair

"Being a white male in 1949 wasn't exactly super fantastic either.

For one, your dating pool is diminished. You can't date black, asian, or hispanic women. You can't associate too much with people of different races. Also, the era was positively dripping in toxic masculinity. There was a very specific ""way to be"" and if you didn't fit into that role then you were ostracized. Too sensitive? Not athletic enough? Not into joining the military? Not into stereotypical hobbies and careers for your race and gender? Sorry, you're fucked, society is going to shit all over you. And god help you if you have an extremely common mental health issue like depression, anxiety, or adhd. You'll just get called a layabout or overly sensitive and shunned.

Meanwhile, school is a nightmare. It's the utmost in rigid discipline and rote ""education"" through memorization. And if you don't do well or you ""cause trouble"" or whatever, well, there's corporal punishment for you. This was the system that Pink Floyd's ""The Wall"" rails against, that Dead Poet's society depicts (with brutal consequences for one of the characters there), and so on. Being a white male in 1949 didn't mean you too didn't have to keep in line, it just meant that there were slightly different levels of badness to work around and if you were super lucky to naturally fall into the super specific kind of person that 1940s and '50s society forced you to be then I guess maybe things were alright, but on balance it was problematic for everyone.",,,,rocketsocks,,,1452849314,t5_2qhad,t3_410364,t1_cyyo2b4,12,1454505254,0,0,cyz0ymz,Seattle,12,,

"The article says: 

&gt; State figures only include time spent on I-405.

In other words, they measure the time spent on that particular freeway. But the changes in the rules for I-405 mean that many people are spending lots of time backed-up, waiting in traffic, even at 630am, before ever getting to I-405. They're on ramps, or on ramps to get to ramps, or backed up in traffic constipation that pushes way back into commercial districts.  That time doesn't get measured. It doesn't go into the state's assessment of traffic speeds.

WS-DOT have absolutely succeeded in making the 405 part faster. But the parts before and after 405 are much slower, for almost everyone.  

Not saying it is a failure though.  Making the 405 part faster is exactly what the project was intended to do.  They did it, the region gets to keep federal funds. But the impact is significantly negative on most regular auto commuters. Which is to say, the large majority of commuters.

"Actually, ""taxation is not regulations"" is certainly not true, at least not as applied here. Let me illustrate.

For example, let's say I am a politician in a predominantly Jewish town, and I am running for reelection, and my election perspectives are uncertain. I would like to curry a favor with my (predominantly Jewish) electorate, so I want to try and ban ""Mein Kampf"". But of course I cannot ban it outright, because US has this First Amendment on its books, and banning it will run afoul of it. So I am saying that, well, I am not banning it, but I will tax it 100% and put the money into the ""inclusiveness"" fund.

Now, of course, there is the Internet, and no book store would go out of business because they can't sell ""Mein Kampf"". But let's consider another example.

Let's say we're living in a deeply Christian town in Alabama, and the aforementioned politician, suffering in the polls because his son came out as a gay, proposes a 100% tax on the books that contain swear words, with proceeds going to ""creating opportunities"" fund. Same thing. This time the book stores DO go out of business, because there's always Amazon, and of course, the number of books with the swear words in the town doesn't change (because, again, there's still Amazon).

Seems far fetched? But this is EXACTLY how Burgess has played Seattle.

Is this a case of taxation, or a regulation? Judge Palmer Robinson and Seattle City Council think that it is not regulation. I hope that the higher courts will disagree. I think everyone - especially the liberals - would hope that the higher courts will disagree, because the precedent that this creates - any law can be worked around by a high enough tax - is extremely dangerous.",,,,preciseshooter,,,1451943813,t5_2qhad,t3_3zexuz,t1_cylw75e,11,1454279963,0,0,cylzpul,Seattle,11,,

"The whole idea of ""Seattleites don't use umbrellas"" is just silly.

It just doesn't rain hard enough to warrant using one *most of the time*. When it's actually a medium-to-hard rain, they're great to have. Especially since they do a better job of protecting your legs and shoes then a jacket, by far.

I say, get a compact one that fits in a satchel/purse/whatever for days where there's potential rain beyond just a shower. (So yeah, check the weather in the morning) You don't need a giant one and those are a hazard in a crowd... just keep it to a small diameter and be mindful of where you're sticking that thing. Also, shake it off before entering buildings so you don't drip all over the interior- that's rude.

For lighter rain, a hat/cap does the trick; it's good to keep one of those on hand too.

Hoods are overrated. Even if you don't care that they look like crap (and if it's raining hard, I get that), they destroy your peripheral vision, making it a lot riskier to cross streets unless you swivel your whole body around each time you do do, and additionally they make you less safe from street crime by the said limitation of vision as well as dampening sound and making it less directional.

Not only that, but let's be frank: the pedestrian traffic in Downtown Seattle has always been heavy. As the population in this area increases -- and most of the tourist attractions in the area are largely in downtown -- it stands to reason that the pedestrian traffic will only get heavier. You have native Seattlites, transplants, and tourists all in that mix. Only 1 of those 3 groups even knows traffic rules and regulations in this area, and maybe 1/2 of 1 of those groups really gives a shit about car traffic in downtown when they are busy trying to find the first Starbucks.

It, therefore, stands to reason that anyone expecting a quick car trip through downtown Seattle is, simply put, gonna have a bad time.

Avoid at all costs, for all the obvious reasons.

"Ok, Ladies and Gentlemen, this is a good time to educate yourself on ""assault weapons"". I found a fantastic site (www.assaultweapon.info) which has a great overview of the subject matter; sadly, it is currently down. I pulled together a short abstract using the cache, so here it is:

There is a big confusion between a commonly accepted term, ""assault rifle"", and a term created specifically to push the ban, ""assault weapon"".

Assault rifle, for example, an M4 Carbine, is a weapon used by US military. It is capable of automatic fire, which means that multiple rounds (up to 950 per minute), are fired every time a trigger is pushed.

The M4A1 and other fully automatic firearms are also called machine guns. In 1986, the Federal government banned the sale or transfer of new machine guns to civilians.

Like the majority of firearms sold in the United States, the AR-15 is semi-automatic. This means it fires one round each time the trigger is pulled.


The AR-15 can fire between 45 and 60 rounds per minute depending on the skill of the operator. This rate of fire is comparable to other semi-automatic firearms, but pales in comparison to fully automatic assault rifles, some of which can fire more than 1,000 rounds per minute.

So-called assault weapons are not machine guns or assault rifles. According to David Kopel, writing in The Wall Street Journal:

""What some people call ""assault weapons"" function like every other normal firearm—they fire only one bullet each time the trigger is pressed. Unlike automatics (machine guns), they do not fire continuously as long as the trigger is held. ... Today in America, most handguns are semi-automatics, as are many long guns, including the best-selling rifle today, the AR-15, the model used in the Newtown shooting. Some of these guns look like machine guns, but they do not function like machine guns.""

The truth about assault weapons is that they function like common shotguns, semi-automatic rifles popular with the hunters and ranchers, or just any regular pistol or a revolver. All of these guns fire one round each time the trigger is pulled.

So what makes a gun into an ""assault weapon""? The answer is perception. According to a 1988 report by the Violence Policy Center, an anti-gun lobby:

""[H]andgun restriction is simply not viewed as a priority. Assault weapons ... are a new topic. The weapons' menacing looks, coupled with the public's confusion over fully automatic machine guns versus semi-automatic assault weapons—anything that looks like a machine gun is assumed to be a machine gun—can only increase the chance of public support for restrictions on these weapons.""

In the late 1980s, more than two decades after the AR-15 was first sold to the American public, the anti-gun lobby began a systematic campaign to conflate it and other ""military-style"" firearms with machine guns. The media followed suit, and soon the American public began to think that an assault weapon was, like the assault rifles it resembled, a machine gun.

This strategy came to fruition in 1993, when the Federal Assault Weapons Ban (AWB) was introduced in Congress. The AWB would ban the sale of new assault weapons to American civilians.

However, since ""assault weapon"" was an invented term, it had no technical meaning. Before assault weapons could be banned, legislators had to define them.

Because assault rifles were already banned, and because an outright ban on semi-automatic firearms wasn't considered politically feasible, the AWB defined assault weapons as semi-automatic firearms that shared too many cosmetic features with their fully automatic counterparts.

These banned ""military-style"" features included certain combinations of collapsible stocks, flash hiders, and pistol grips, none of which actually made the firearms more lethal.

According to a Department of Justice study, the firearms that the AWB would ban were used in only 2% of gun crimes.

Nevertheless, the AWB's passage was aided by the fact that many Americans believed the bill would ban machine guns and ""weapons of war,"" something that had, in fact, already been banned.

The AWB also banned magazines having a capacity higher than ten rounds. This restriction applied to all firearms, not just so-called assault weapons.

To secure enough votes to pass the bill, a sunset provision was added. After ten years, the AWB would end.

On September 13, 1994, the Federal Assault Weapons Ban went into effect. A Washington Post editorial published two days later was candid about the ban's real purpose:

""[N]o one should have any illusions about what was accomplished [by the ban]. Assault weapons play a part in only a small percentage of crime. The provision is mainly symbolic; its virtue will be if it turns out to be, as hoped, a stepping stone to broader gun control. ""


When the AWB became law, manufacturers began retooling to produce firearms and magazines that were compliant. One of those ban-compliant firearms was the Hi-Point 995, which was sold with ten-round magazines.

In 1999, five years into the Federal Assault Weapons Ban, the Columbine High School massacre occurred. One of the perpetrators, Eric Harris, was armed with a Hi-Point 995.

Undeterred by the ten-round capacity of his magazines, Harris simply brought more of them: thirteen magazines would be found in the massacre's aftermath. Harris fired 96 rounds before killing himself.

In 2004, the Federal Assault Weapons Ban expired. It was not renewed. The AWB had failed to have an impact on gun crime in the United States. A 2004 Department of Justice report concluded:

""Should it be renewed, the ban's effects on gun violence are likely to be small at best and perhaps too small for reliable measurement. [Assault weapons] were rarely used in gun crimes even before the ban. ""

Regarding large capacity magazines, the study said:

""[I]t is not clear how often the outcomes of gun attacks depend on the ability of offenders to fire more than ten shots (the current magazine capacity limit) without reloading. ""

Furthermore, legislators had misjudged the popularity of so-called assault weapons. In his memoir, Bill Clinton wrote that Democrats lost control of Congress in the 1994 midterm elections because of the AWB. Other Democrats have stated that the AWB may have cost Al Gore the 2000 presidential election.

At Virginia Tech in 2007, Seung-Hui Cho again showed the futility of regulating magazine capacity when he carried nineteen ten- and fifteen-round magazines in his backpack as part of a carefully planned massacre.

Cho used seventeen of the magazines and fired approximately 170 rounds—or ten rounds per magazine—from two handguns before killing himself.

Like Eric Harris before him, Cho demonstrated that a magazine's capacity was incidental to the amount of death and injury an unopposed murderer could cause in a ""gun-free zone.""

Although the Virginia Tech massacre was and remains the deadliest school shooting in U.S. history, it resulted in relatively few calls for new gun control, possibly because so-called assault weapons were not used.

But after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, the AR-15 and other so-called assault weapons were widely depicted as military weapons whose only purpose was to rapidly kill large numbers of people.

In reality, so-called assault weapons are commonly used by hunters and competitors.
 
It has been estimated that at least 3.3 million AR-15 rifles were sold in the United States between 1986 and 2009. In its ubiquity, the AR-15 is a modern musket—the default rifle with which law-abiding Americans exercise their right to keep and bear arms.

The AR-15 is particularly favored for its modularity, accuracy, light weight, and low recoil—attributes that make it ideal not only for shooting sports but also armed self-defense.

As such, it is the epitome of what America's founders sought to protect when they wrote the Second Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.

Nevertheless, on December 17, 2012, Senator Dianne Feinstein, the author of the original AWB, announced her intention to introduce another Federal Assault Weapons Ban in Congress.

However, Senator Feinstein's own facts do not support her agenda. The truth about assault weapons is that they are underrepresented in gun crimes.

According to Senator Feinstein, so-called assault weapons have been used in 385 murders since the AWB expired in 2004, or about 48 murders per year. But there were 8,583 total murders with guns in the United States in 2011, meaning so-called assault weapons were used 0.6% of the time.

Further illustrating the small role so-called assault weapons play in crime, FBI data shows that 323 murders were committed with rifles of any kind in 2011. In comparison, 496 murders were committed with hammers and clubs, and 1,694 murders were perpetrated with knives.

Insofar as the AR-15 is used in crimes, the rifle's popularity must be considered.

Besides the AR-15, James Holmes used a best-selling and arguably more lethal shotgun at the Aurora movie theater shooting.

At the Virginia Tech and Tucson shootings, Seung-Hui Cho and Jared Loughner used a best-selling handgun.

All else being equal, a gun that is common is more likely to be used for legal or illegal purposes than a gun that is rare. Outlawing guns that are popular today will only make different guns popular tomorrow.

The truth about assault weapons is that there is no such thing. So-called assault weapons are semi-automatic firearms—the guns most commonly used by millions of law-abiding Americans.

Banning firearms because of their cosmetic features is misguided.

Because the blown-out disc in the second shot is larger than the moon from the first shot, I had to embiggen the moon - and the part of the aircraft beacon mast directly in front of it - to cover the white area.  I then lightened the exposure on the upper portion of the mast, and thickened the legs of the lower portion, to match a bit better. As another commenter pointed out, there are some dangling wires that don't connect properly due to this change in size.

"Yeah,  I'm a big fan.  Ride a bike everyday.  Cant really stow it under the seat on the bus when the bike rack is full,  or sling it over my shoulder as I walk through a building. Chain it up in the city?  Might as well put a free sign on it. Want to not get sweaty?  Better avoid riding on a road to keep pace with the drivers around you.  

This is a ""last mile""  solution.  Bikes are more  mid range,  ""last 5 - 25 mile""  answers.  They can fit in the niche,  but they aren't the ideal answer for it. 

Nothing wrong  with having more  personal transit options out there.  Means one less car on the road,  getting in your way. All you have to put up with is someone else having more fun than you.  Sounds like a win win.

"My response assumes no specific legal hurdles, funding issues, or lack of labor for them.  Reality of today is there are many hurdles here that need to be cleared though such discussions are likely beyond the scope of OP's question.

Immediate solutions: Quickly find more space anywhere for more authorized encampments, using public land if necessary. Divide them into encampments focused on different steps of recovery. One focused on those who just became homeless and had a good past, to help them bounce back quickly. Have storage nearby for belongings they may still have from a recent eviction. Second one focused on the more longer term homeless also working to climb back up. And a third type that focuses on those with severe addictions. Third encampment would allow drug use in safe ways while working on their issues from a health perspective and not a criminal one. Ideally all three types of encampments would be spread around the area, avoiding concentrating them in any particular spot to be easily forgotten about again.

Longer term solutions: Continue to build and fund no/low income housing scattered throughout the area. Rebuild a lot of the mental health assistance that has crumbled. Decriminalize (though not legalize) all drugs and turn possession/use into a health issue ala Portugal. Massively simplify the welfare process and other assistive services up to and including basic minimum income. Turn both physical and mental health care into a right for all people.

"&gt; They don't seem as concerned about vaginas, are they also in play here?

It does seem to be mostly about penises in places they don't ""belong"", and concern trolling that somehow a trans person in the ""wrong"" bathroom will automatically start raping everyone else in that bathroom. If you look at the [Houston Equal Rights Ordinance](https://ballotpedia.org/City_of_Houston_Anti-Discrimination_HERO_Veto_Referendum,_Proposition_1_(November_2015\)) that was voted on a few months ago, it was a very broad anti-discrimination statute but the opposition to it focused on transgender people and restrooms, and of that opposition it was all about men in women's restrooms and not the opposite.

Personally, I think it's ridiculous - there is a ton of sexual assault in our society, but I suspect that the amount that starts with a straight cis man dressing up as a woman so he can sneak into the women's restroom is practically zero.

Ultimately I think making restrooms non-gendered is the way to go (or, keep 2 separate restrooms, but stop caring if someone uses ""the wrong one""). If I'm in a restroom and I want privacy (such as in a stall with pants around my ankles) then I want privacy from everyone, no matter what their gender is.

"You completely missed the point apparently. 

Let me spell it out- I **know** they have their own police force- the question is why a CITY has fewer officers on staff, and apparently ready and willing to answer a call, than obviously far overstaffed and under utilized force for a tiny suburban township on the outskirts like bothell that has almost no crime. 


It's **almost** as if the cops are where there is low actual risk and crime, and where there is more **money** to be milked from a populace.

Busting homeless camps doesn't pay for shiny toys, but having a swat level response for a misdemeanor in the suburbs gets everyone a medal and its seen as proof that low crime is due to a large and present police force.

So the hamster wheel of bullshit security theater continues here in the burbs while the city is rife with crime.

Makes a ton of sense to me! 

Or you know, pass some state legislation that makes it so police forces that are 10 godamn minutes away from each other with sirens blaring can assist each other without having a giant pissing match over whose funds are getting used.

"**Some perspective here:** Sinkholes are extremely common when digging tunnels. In recent memory, this happened in Beacon Hill when they dug the light-rail tunnel from the airport to downtown.


**A little more perspective:** Bertha is digging in the **worst possible soil conditions right now.** Water-logged fill dirt next to a sea. Likely with a lot of other organic material in it, like old rotted logs or garbage, that was thrown in there in the early 1900s. The organic material creates these kind of sinkholes.

**Some good news!!:** once Berth gets past the viaduct and up to 2nd Ave (where it will be tunneling northward), the soil is **NOT fill dirt**, very stable, and very compact. This is the optimal conditions for tunneling. The probability of sink holes or any other problems goes **way down** once it's east of the viaduct.

"As an Indian, I can offer my recommendations:

- Madras Dosa Corner, Issaquah (South Indian Cuisine): When most people think of Indian food, they think of Naan, Tikka Masala and likes (generalized within India as ""North Indian"" cuisine). There's a whole array of dishes (""South Indian"" cuisine) that are not very popular in the US. Try the Mysore Masala Dosa, Parotta + Kurma, Ven Pongal.

Pro Tip to get some real Indian experience: Eat with your hand, if you can, whenever you're served with a dish containing two components. Most dishes are meant to be eaten with a 'side' (e.g. tear off a piece of the naan and use it to scoop some masala/curry, Parotta with the Kurma, etc.) It is the mixing of two components in appropriate quantities and eating them together that brings out the flavors best. Its easiest to do this with your hand (albeit a little messy), and a little difficult with a fork. If you don't like getting your hands dirty, hold the naan/dosa/parotta at the edge and dip in the side. But please DO NOT put a piece of naan in your mouth and then follow it up with a spoonful of tikka masala. 

- Chaat N Roll, Issaquah: 'Chaat' is Indian savory snacks and typically found on road-side carts (street food) in India. Try out the Pani Puri, Bhel Puri, Samosa Chaat. Not a lot of people know about these. But very flavorful! ",,,,iluvmylife,,,1453168463,t5_2qhad,t3_41m8d2,t3_41m8d2,15,1454581477,0,0,cz3fsq7,Seattle,15,,

"I'm adventurous as hell and I've spent a lot of time homeless and camping long term, on purpose and not.

You don't actually want to do this. You have no idea how hard it is to maintain a job while homeless. Basic tasks like food, hygiene and laundry become a nearly full time job because you can no longer time shift by, say, cooking dinner while laundry is running. You get to do one task at a time.

Then there's the very real possibility your RV itself gets stolen entirely, towed away for illegal parking or otherwise burgled, which leads directly to missed work trying to recover it and deal with suddenly not having the home, clean clothes, food, kitchen and stuff you were counting on to be there to go to work tomorrow.

You will also end up sharing the streets with addicts and junkies. 

Try to park and camp among them and you'll find that your boundaries aren't respected, and that they'll likely be upset that they feel that you think you're better than them because you have a job, don't want to hang out and share beer/food and/or ""loan"" them money for cigarettes or drugs. When that happens they will burgle your shit and make things really difficult.

If you do successfully negotiate how to co-exist, they will drag you down with them, even if it's just by keeping you up late with shouting, verbal disagreements and full on domestic violence.

There is *nothing* idyllic or chill about camping on the street in an RV in a city. It's a non-stop anxiety rollercoaster and razor's edge of ""Damn, I better go check on my RV and stay there. I might lose everything if I don't.""

"From multiple discussions on this, as well as some family of mine in Ballard who were party to trying to get this going in their area:

1. They are off duty police officers making extra money on the side. They wear their uniforms and can carry their gun.
2. Cost is typically $250 per household per year.
3. This price buys a 4 hour patrol once a week.
4. People who pay into the system may have perks above those who do not pay in, such as having the patrol look in at their house while on vacation.

So what I got out of this was

* Neighborhoods who have enough money will get 4 hours of extra security a week, which isn't much of a presence at all. 
* I feel it is a conflict of interest that a police officer, arguably whos job is already to keep our neighborhoods safe as paid by our tax dollars, can now make more money on his own time caring for a pocket of a neighborhood who can afford them, basically doubling down. This feels like a baby step toward privatizing police forces, and only the richest neighborhoods being looked after. (Particularly concerning they can use their regular work uniform and sidearm. Seems to me if it is truly their off-duty time, they shouldn't be leveraging police force-specific resources?)
* Those who cannot afford to pay into it will receive less care and attention. See my privatizing concern above.

Basically, I would rather address the ongoing issues of finding a way to increase our police force city-wide. If I could pay $250 into that, I would in a heartbeat. But sadly it's not that simple...

And Austin's zoning and planning policies are almost as bad as SF's.  It sucks for people with normal jobs.  Speaking as someone who currently lives in Austin, there is another wave of refugees fleeing the Silicon refugees and moving to San Antonio, where you can still scoop up a 1910's Spanish Victorian bungalow for $130k or so.

"I'm sure that by ""kicked out"", you mean "" allowed to sell at a huge profit.""

By building more housing we can slow down the crazy rent and land price increases, but I highly doubt that we will reduce prices so that Seattle comes back into the ""affordable"" range. That ship has long since sailed. If you're looking for single family affordability and livability, Seattle proper is the wrong place to look. Check out the Midwest or some smaller PNW communities. :)

Still, The constraints of space means that eventually, in the end, someone will own the property, regardless of the cost. By increasing density, we increase the number of people that can afford to live here. Higher density means more people can enjoy Seattle's awesomeness without going broke.... And that seems like a good thing!

"A lot of people have this romantic idea of homeless people being these virtuous souls who are down on their luck because they lost their jobs and couldn't pay their mortgage or something. If only they could just get that one opportunity it would *all* turn around!

I get the feeling that the majority of homeless people are mentally ill and thus cannot properly function socially, or they are hardcore drug users, or some combination. That they are homeless and causing problems is really a failure of society to acknowledge that we need to support people who otherwise ""contribute nothing."" There is nothing shameful about that, and in a world where we were still wild apes we would not have these problems because nature would take care of them. But we live in a domesticated society with all kinds of morality, so the only ethical thing to do is to fund places for these people to go so that they are properly cared for rather than flooding them onto our streets every morning at sunrise.

I encounter all kinds of crazy up and down Broadway and when they get confrontational, it's pretty scary. At the same time, I have to wonder why they are let to roam around the streets to fend for themselves. If you're already homeless and committing crimes, what do you really have to lose?

"[continuing] 

Finally, Walter looked at me and said, “One hundred fifty-six knots. What did you see?” Trying to find my voice, I stammered, “One hundred fifty-two.” We sat in silence for a moment. Then Walt said, “Don’t ever do that to me again!” And I never did. A year later, Walter and I were having lunch in the Mildenhall Officer’s club, and overheard an officer talking to some cadets about an SR-71 fly-past that he had seen one day. Of course, by now the story included kids falling off the tower and screaming as the heat of the jet singed their eyebrows. Noticing our HABU patches, as we stood there with lunch trays in our hands, he asked us to verify to the cadets that such a thing had occurred. Walt just shook his head and said, “It was probably just a routine low approach; they're pretty impressive in that plane.” Impressive indeed. Little did I realize after relaying this experience to my audience that day that it would become one of the most popular and most requested stories. 

It’s ironic that people are interested in how slow the world’s fastest jet can fly. Regardless of your speed, however, it’s always a good idea to keep that cross-check up…and keep your Mach up, too.
There were a lot of things we couldn’t do in an SR-71, but we were the fastest guys on the block and loved reminding our fellow aviators of this fact. People often asked us if, because of this fact, it was fun to fly the jet. Fun would not be the first word I would use to describe flying this plane. Intense, maybe. Even cerebral. But there was one day in our Sled experience when we would have to say that it was pure fun to be the fastest guys out there, at least for a moment. It occurred when Walt and I were flying our final training sortie. We needed 100 hours in the jet to complete our training and attain Mission Ready status. Somewhere over Colorado we had passed the century mark. We had made the turn in Arizona and the jet was performing flawlessly. My gauges were wired in the front seat and we were starting to feel pretty good about ourselves, not only because we would soon be flying real missions but because we had gained a great deal of confidence in the plane in the past ten months. Ripping across the barren deserts 80,000 feet below us, I could already see the coast of California from the Arizona border. 

I was, finally, after many humbling months of simulators and study, ahead of the jet. I was beginning to feel a bit sorry for Walter in the back seat. There he was, with no really good view of the incredible sights before us, tasked with monitoring four different radios. This was good practice for him for when we began flying real missions, when a priority transmission from headquarters could be vital. It had been difficult, too, for me to relinquish control of the radios, as during my entire flying career I had controlled my own transmissions. But it was part of the division of duties in this plane and I had adjusted to it. I still insisted on talking on the radio while we were on the ground, however. Walt was so good at many things, but he couldn’t match my expertise at sounding smooth on the radios, a skill that had been honed sharply with years in fighter squadrons where the slightest radio miscue was grounds for beheading. He understood that and allowed me that luxury. Just to get a sense of what Walt had to contend with, I pulled the radio toggle switches and monitored the frequencies along with him. The predominant radio chatter was from Los Angeles Center, far below us, controlling daily traffic in their sector. 

While they had us on their scope (albeit briefly), we were in uncontrolled airspace and normally would not talk to them unless we needed to descend into their airspace. We listened as the shaky voice of a lone Cessna pilot asked Center for a readout of his ground speed. Center replied: November Charlie 175, I’m showing you at ninety knots on the ground. Now the thing to understand about Center controllers, was that whether they were talking to a rookie pilot in a Cessna, or to Air Force One, they always spoke in the exact same, calm, deep, professional, tone that made one feel important. I referred to it as the “ HoustonCentervoice.” I have always felt that after years of seeing documentaries on this country’s space program and listening to the calm and distinct voice of the Houstoncontrollers, that all other controllers since then wanted to sound like that… and that they basically did. And it didn’t matter what sector of the country we would be flying in, it always seemed like the same guy was talking. Over the years that tone of voice had become somewhat of a comforting sound to pilots everywhere. 

Conversely, over the years, pilots always wanted to ensure that, when transmitting, they sounded like Chuck Yeager, or at least like John Wayne. Better to die than sound bad on the radios. Just moments after the Cessna’s inquiry, a Twin Beech piped up on frequency, in a rather superior tone, asking for his groundspeed. Twin Beach, I have you at one hundred and twenty-five knots of ground speed. Boy, I thought, the Beechcraft really must think he is dazzling his Cessna brethren. Then out of the blue, a navy F-18 pilot out of NAS Lemoore came up on frequency. You knew right away it was a Navy jock because he sounded very cool on the radios. Center, Dusty 52 ground speed check Before Center could reply, I’m thinking to myself, hey, Dusty 52 has a ground speed indicator in that million-dollar cockpit, so why is he asking Center for a readout? 

Then I got it, ol’ Dusty here is making sure that every bug smasher from Mount Whitney to the Mojave knows what true speed is. He’s the fastest dude in the valley today, and he just wants everyone to know how much fun he is having in his new Hornet. And the reply, always with that same, calm, voice, with more distinct alliteration than emotion: Dusty 52, Center, we have you at 620 on the ground. And I thought to myself, is this a ripe situation, or what? As my hand instinctively reached for the mic button, I had to remind myself that Walt was in control of the radios. Still, I thought, it must be done – in mere seconds we’ll be out of the sector and the opportunity will be lost. That Hornet must die, and die now. I thought about all of our Sim training and how important it was that we developed well as a crew and knew that to jump in on the radios now would destroy the integrity of all that we had worked toward becoming. I was torn. Somewhere, 13 miles above Arizona, there was a pilot screaming inside his space helmet. Then, I heard it. 

The click of the mic button from the back seat. That was the very moment that I knew Walter and I had become a crew. Very professionally, and with no emotion, Walter spoke: Los Angeles Center, Aspen 20, can you give us a ground speed check? There was no hesitation, and the replay came as if was an everyday request. Aspen 20, I show you at one thousand eight hundred and forty-two knots, across the ground. I think it was the forty-two knots that I liked the best, so accurate and proud was Center to deliver that information without hesitation, and you just knew he was smiling. 

But the precise point at which I knew that Walt and I were going to be really good friends for a long time was when he keyed the mic once again to say, in his most fighter-pilot-like voice: **Ah, Center, much thanks, We’re showing closer to nineteen hundred on the money. For a moment Walter was a god. And we finally heard a little crack in the armor of the HoustonCentervoice, when L.A.came back with: Roger that Aspen, Your equipment is probably more accurate than ours. You boys have a good one.** It all had lasted for just moments, but in that short, memorable sprint across the southwest, the Navy had been flamed, all mortal airplanes on freq were forced to bow before the King of Speed, and more importantly, Walter and I had crossed the threshold of being a crew. A fine day’s work. We never heard another transmission on that frequency all the way to the coast. For just one day, it truly was fun being the fastest guys out there.

"Exactly. Being homeless is not criminality, but the crappy actions and even illegal parking and squatting are. People can't be allowed to just illegally park everywhere because they're homeless. This is the issue the ""safe parking lots"" idea is attempting to deal with. If safe parking spots were designated, at least for overnight, residents could know to avoid those areas if they don't want contact, the spots could be monitored easily, and lawlessness there could be easily seen and dealt with.

Honestly, if someone parks their RV or whatever that they're living in in front of my house without asking me, I'd raise hell, absolutely. It's not cool. It's not even legal. Even with my permission it's not legal, as I don't own that patch of street. And then if there's *any* evidence of additional law-breaking or crimes, even more hell raised. There are alternatives. There are legal RV parks, RV camping spots, legal camping areas, actual homeless shelters, etc. And if they can't find a legal solution here, they should go to another place where they *can* be legal.

There really should be zero tolerance for stealing bikes, doing drugs, pooping on the street, etc., as you said. These behaviors and homelessness should really stay viewed as two separate issues.

The response to growth in most American cities has been to increase car capacity far beyond what it should be.  We are far beyond the point of diminishing returns, in Seattle.  Every increase in car capacity just increases the size of traffic jams.  *It doesn't fix the problem.*

We need higher-density housing, in the city, and that has been happening.  And we need solid public transport, as well as better support for bikes, because you can fit far more bikes in the same area (and more safely) than you can cars.

But go ahead and keep thinking that reality is ""smug"".  Go to Berlin, and see how fast you can get from one side of the city to the other, during the peak hours.  It's 15 minutes, *tops*.  Now do it in London -- the Tube is like a fucking Star Trek transporter, it's magic.

"People are pretty divided on the issue of elephant captivity. I got to know Chai, as well as Bamboo and Watoto, her handlers, the protestors, I even met and talked with the director of the AZA about the issue.

The story of Chai breaks my heart. I learned that elephants are incredibly intelligent animals, and that a great share of that is put into emotional connections with each other. Their strongest bonds are between mother and daughter. Females stay in the herd, stay with their mothers their whole lives. Chai was taken from her mother for the sake of publicity. Alyne Fortgang described it to me as one of the most traumatic things that can happen to an elephant.

Chai was taken to a breeding program that was known to have an infection with herpes virus. She endured an invasive procedure 112  times before becoming pregnant with Hansa. Unsurprisingly, Chai had become a carrier for herpes in the process, and passed the herpes virus onto her daughter. The money spent trying to inseminate Hansa could have saved thousands of wild elephants, but when Hansa was born, she was the only success of captivity breeding that year.

Chai had to witness the caretakers beat her daughter with a bullhook right in front of her. This was an accepted practice at the time. Chai had to watch her daughter die at her feet at the age of seven, the herpes virus causing organ failure and bleeding from the eyes.

When I met Chai, she had developed a nervous tick of shuffling her feet. Everyone disagreed on why she did it, But some told me her feet were irritated by urine scalds. For up to 17 hours a day in the winter, she had to stand in puddles of her own urine in a cage that's too small to turn around.

Chai lived longer than some elephants in captivity, shorter than the disputed average for elephants in the wild. I do not think that we should have elephants in zoos at all. No zoo could possibly be adequate for an elephant's physical and emotional needs. Poachers have even been known to kill off a baby elephant's parents in order to sell it to a zoo as an orphan. The money wasted on the totally ineffective breeding program should be put towards saving elephants in the wild.",,,,OftenPyr,,,1454235905,t5_2qhad,t3_43f4hq,t3_43f4hq,11,1454842786,0,0,czigyl3,Seattle,11,,

"Information inside the community tells us that a member, who was a moderator though not the owner, was involved in managing providers from a foreign country. While most providers in most agencies were consensual and fully informed it is possible that some were in the sort of economic, social, or mental distress that makes us all squeamish about sex work in general. I have no evidence other than meeting a few in person and hearing rumor of the rest to support the previous statement. The agencies managing the international providers were advertising on the review board and gaining strong support. Due to the international and interstate links, plus publicity, the fed is interested. 

The effect on the majority of TRB participants is a severance from community interaction, advertising, and searching for reputable providers. I personally will not be accepting new clients until I feel either safe or closer to broke. I can't imagine how the less stable and privileged than I are reacting when desperation must be much closer. I've been getting and sending texts and emails all day, took my website down, purged my email, and am hamstrung because of my precautions. Please recognize that despite the recent (about 2 years ago) surge in foreign interest, TRB has provided a safe and resilient community for many enthusiastic, if sometimes odd, providers and clients.

"Here's my opinions on the homeless as a techie transplant: 

1. I fucking hate them. Not as people, I'm sure they got some real shit going on, but I hate the phenomenon. I hate being hassled for change, I hate the dirty streets, I hate stepping over people on sidewalks, I hate my female friends feeling too intimidated to wait alone at certain bus stops. 

2. I think dealing with them is the government's job. Whether that means providing them homes, providing them physical healthcare, or mental healthcare, or debt relief, or arresting them, I pretty much don't care so long as the solution is actually effective. I don't even want to talk about what the most cost-effective solution is, that's the government's job to figure out too. 

3. I'm comfortable paying more taxes than I currently am to resolve this situation. I'm Canadian, I believe that taxes are a small price to pay for civilization, and what I've been seeing here among the homeless is *not* civilization. So raise my taxes, figure out what the fuck we're going to do, and fucking do it. Stop wasting time.

"1949 America was super racist. Seattle was maybe not as bad as, say, parts of the deep South, but that just means it was only super racist instead of catastrophically horrifically racist. Segregation basically existed universally across the entire US, the difference was that outside of the south the population of black people was low enough so that segregation mostly existed by keeping non-whites from moving into cities at all (red lining, exclusionary covenants in deeds, sundown laws, blue laws, etc.) or keeping them restricted to certain neighborhoods. In Seattle, for example, it was basically impossible for blacks to live anywhere outside of the central district up until the 1970s, and even then it was difficult to get mortgages due to the tail end of red lining. And most of the hospitals wouldn't treat non-white patients during the 1940s and even through some of the '50s. But it's not as though lots of black folks were walking up to Virginia Mason, so they didn't need signs saying ""whites only"" like they had in the South.

Then you have [things like this](https://depts.washington.edu/civilr/coon_chicken.htm) which was still standing when this picture was taken. (Edit: ""this picture"" being the picture of the waterfront in 1949, of course.)

Also, you have to look at the recent history from the point of view of 1949. Just a few years prior American citizens of Japanese heritage were effectively run out of town on a rail as part of the systematic internment of ethnic Japanese individuals during WWII. With heated debates for years after the war about whether the Japanese-Americans should be allowed to return to Seattle. In the 1940s after the Japanese-Americans had been allowed to return to Western Washington a newspaper in Sumner, the Standard, published ""OUR OBJECTIVE: BANISH JAPS FOREVER FROM THE USA"" on the front page for over 2 years straight. Just like in the rest of the country there were issues of racial or religious segregation with many local clubs. The Laurelhurst Beach Club didn't allow jews to join until they were sued into being forced to do so in 1957. The Seattle police force was basically ""super racist"" up through the 1960s, if not longer. And in the late 1930s there were several anti-black race riots, just as there were regularly in Seattle, Tacoma, Bellingham and throughout the region from the 1880s through the 1930s. That's the backdrop for the era you're looking at. One where if you're not white and christian you have a pretty high chance of being excluded from something or of being on the wrong end of a race riot so you probably develop the habit of keeping to the neighborhoods you know, keeping your head down, and stepping lightly.",,,,rocketsocks,,,1452825344,t5_2qhad,t3_410364,t1_cyyovg8,1497,1454500183,0,1,cyyqhxz,Seattle,1497,,

"Let's look at a recent case of gun violence.

http://www.seattlepi.com/local/crime/article/Police-Felon-tied-to-Capitol-Hill-mass-shooting-6741019.php

Capital Hill mass shooting.   Numerous levels of law preventing him from legally owning a gun.


The people of america stop gun violence.  The millions of law abiding gun owners stop gun violence by being decent people.

Trying to stop criminals with laws is beyond stupid.   Look at chicago, some of the toughest gun and ammunition laws in the country.  Some of the highest rates of gun violence.  It's not the weapon, it's the people.

You know what we don't have?   Acid attacks, and gasoline attacks, and vehicle assault.   These are thing that happen in the rest of the world but they're rare here.

Stop your ivory tower superiority complex thinking.  You can't muzzle people into a perfect world.  You can't cage people into perfection.

Thank goodness for the 2nd amendment keeping this kind of nonsense in check.

"No.  The point was specifically to retain federal money.  The federal rules state that the carpool lanes need to average 45mph at most times, in order to qualify for federal highway grant money.  So the I-405 project expanded the carpool lanes and restricted access (to 3+, rather than 2+; and making them 3+ all day long, instead of only at rush hour).  This insures that the traffic in those lanes specifically flows more freely.  

The goal was not ""to get more people to carpool"" and was not ""to get most people to work faster"".  

Even now there are often massive traffic jams at 11 am or 12 noon on any random Saturday or Sunday on 405, because people don't want to pay the $1 or whatever to get the HOT lane. This is ridiculous. Hundreds of cars idling and burning gas, while two lanes sit mostly empty and unused.

"I totally respect your opinion; but as a professional actor in Seattle, myself, I would have loved it (even if I was performing in a city i wasn't from) . It would have told me that the crowd was in a good mood, that they're lively, and that they're ready to have a kick ass time. I can't tell you how many audiences I've played for that are good naturedly super-quiet and polite, but unintentionally dead weight behind the 4th wall. I can almost guarantee you that the actors were a-okay with it. Plus....they've done that show a million times by that point, so they aren't super sensitive to their work being unappreciated, they're always hoping for a upbeat audience that will reward good work. Also worth keeping in mind, is that this was obviously a Sunday matinee performance (no pre-show dinner/alcohol for the audience), so there usually an older crowd, or folks who realize that they're giving up an afternoon of coziness or productivity to go to the theatre - there's some fighting against that for the cast.

And we can thank state cuts to higher-ed funding for this trend. In the last few years, **25%** of admitted students have been foreign, due to the fact that they pay nearly triple the tuition. UW wants to make money off of wealthy foreign kids as a cash cow, and is now explicitly [giving preference](http://www.crpe.org/publications/are-residents-losing-their-edge-public-university-admissions-case-university-washington) to foreign students over in-state students.

"Unfortunately, this is usually the case. There is an often held, yet incorrect, belief about the qualifications of a ""service animal"" and the legal protections offered to the owner of a service animal.

Under the Americans with Disabilities Act, only a dog, or miniature horse, that has been trained to preform a specific task is a service animal, and therefore entitled to the legal protections of the ADA. An ""emotional support animal"" is not a service animal.

IIRC, air carriers may have an obligation to people with an ""emotional support animal"" under another statute, but I can't remember it at the moment. I'm hoping it doesn't require them to force this nonsense on the rest of the passengers on the plane.

"Psht. No one wants to click a link. I'll just repost myself from a few weeks ago:

A single parking spot at a structured P&amp;amp;R costs approx $40,000 in public funds to build.

But that's just the beginning. That number excludes land acquisition costs, operations and maintenance costs, opportunity costs, secondary infrastructure costs needed for increased traffic to the P&amp;amp;R, tertiary infrastructure costs due to incentivizing third-ring suburbs to sprawl even further out (by their very nature, third-ring suburbs have a very high infrastructure cost compared to the property tax revenue collected), environmental costs, health care costs, lost tax revenue costs, etc, etc.

And all of that is for a single 'free' to use spot that serves a transit ridership of around two or so people per day. That is a staggeringly poor cost to benefit ratio.

High-capacity transit works best when you have residents/businesses developed in a compact pattern surrounding it so that you can walk/bike to the HCT. This is scalable, creates an actual place and destination that encourages all-day/all-week two-way ridership patterns, and is revenue-generating. P&amp;amp;Rs create a fixed ceiling for ridership, are completely dead spaces that serve primarily as no more than a place you travel through versus to, are focused primarily on peak commuter service, and are a revenue sink.

For a quick visual, I took Tukwila Int Blvd Station and draw the standard approx 10-minute walkshed around it. I then picked a random city in Japan (ended up at Nagano) and zoomed in on a [small suburb](https://www.google.com/maps/@36.7112099,138.2759713,2708m/data=!3m1!1e3) outside of the main city. I picked Japan because they have great access to transit most anywhere you go.

[Look at the walkshed of the same land area](https://i.imgur.com/1hbh6qi.jpg) around both stations. From TIBS the only place you can walk to is to your car. There's absofuckinglylutely nowhere there worth walking to (OK, there's a McD's across a sea of parking and a six-lane road as well as a few hard-to-walk-to apartments). Now look at Random Suburban Station outside of Random Japanese City. In the exact same distance there're a shitton of places to go to. Tons of houses. Parks. Schools. Post Offices. Shrines. A hospital. Restaurants. Shops. Farms(!). And it's all low-rise development.

Much of South Lake Union's luxury condos and apartments will be gutted and turned into affordable ""art lofts"" with lots of exposed concrete and metal, and Burning Man 2020 ends up being widely regarded as the best, ever, even by jaded old playa-fuckers.

It's so good that more than half of the 100,000 attendees refused to leave Black Rock City until 2025, causing the amount of spam, online advertising and spyware/malware to decrease by nearly 67% for the duration as marketers can't find enough devs and designers to build out their nefarious schemes.

Meanwhile, the lower half of Lake Union itself ends up getting occupied by a floating kayak city, which thankfully nearly eliminates the fuckin' geese and starts a remarkably thriving system of on-site aquaculture that turns high fiber yuppie shit into clean water and sushi.

By 2019, 75,000 snake people move out Seattle back to their parent's places, causing the almost overnight collapse and bankruptcy of night clubs like Q, Barboza, The Baltic Room and The Woods, which allows Electric Tea Garden to buy Q out including their Funktion One sound system, which they immediately re-configure into a proper stereo array with much rejoicing and jackin' it.

Chachi quickly rises to power after learning how to cook up crack and meth, operate an iPhone and shoot a Glock and becoming so ruthless they she was once described in a court deposition by a high ranking MS13 officer with the words ""Please, don't put me in the kennel with Chachi.

"Not all is media driven. I've personally found needles. I've personally experienced the RV issue. The previous owner of my house had two break-in's that led to him installing a security system. We've all seen the posts and discussions on here from our neighbors talking about how this is directly affecting them. Certainly it's a cycle, but it's hard to distinguish the purely alarmist media, versus the media reporting what's going on.

Sure, you can call this forum ""media"" or ""social media"" and get to a tautological argument that if you don't yourself see it it's pandering since the media is bad. But unless all of us are everywhere, we have no other way of getting information out.

This is coupled with the other side of the argument that the police don't respond to calls. I've lost count of how many times I've read something along the lines of ""just tell them you saw a gun"" to get the police to actually respond to a call. Yes, I understand that without calling you lack data and can't act on it. Yes, we've called things in.

"I'm not trying to be a dick here, but I do know my local laws, and like [this helpful pdf from the City of Seattle](http://www.seattle.gov/Documents/Departments/CityAttorney/Forms/TrespassFAQ-English.pdf) points out, trespass may occur:

&gt;  when people violate the conditions of entry onto property

Additionally

&gt; Individuals who receive notice of the conditions of entry, either by a sign [...] and then subsequently violate those conditions of entry may be arrested for criminal trespass.

The law does not say anything about people having to be asked to leave prior to being arrested - as they have already broken the law by knowingly violating posted conditions of entry. Although as the city document points out, this is the normal procedure that is followed before an arrest is made.

I also found this helpful [FAQ on the Seattle PI](http://blog.seattlepi.com/seattle911/2009/10/14/is-washington-an-open-carry-state-regarding-guns/) that makes it clear bringing a gun onto private property which forbids it constitutes trespass",,,,OSUBrit,,,1453450273,t5_2qhad,t3_4243wh,t1_cz7jxqg,11,1454654323,1,0,cz7khrf,Seattle,11,,

"That's a big question.  Somewhere, I'd like to re-evaluate the assumption that Seattle must attempt to play keep-up with every demand on its limited footprint to the highest bidder in the shortest amount of time.  Nobody wants to stop growth, at least I don't.  But we've done 20 years of growth in 5 years, that is putting a massive strain on the ability for middle class citizens, people who had viable lives and had the ability to rent, now are just being smacked down by the Invisible Hand, fueled by an unending stream of new money and people.  

It all would have happened anyway, but the rate at which its happening means a lot of disruption to the status quo.  If you're one of the new arrivals, and you are many, you think hahaha we win.  And you will, for a while.

I suspect a lot of you will get established and set up, and the minute you do, you'll want to put the brakes on more new growth.  Reason? Your now secure position will be threatened if we keep growing at the pace we're growing at, regardless of how well off you are right now.  That's what we're building here.  We're not building a middle class sustainable model any more, we're allowing hyper-inflation driven by too many change-agents all to hit town at once.  Do we allow land speculators and investment from oligarch income overseas?  How can middle class wage compete with that?   Do we allow unlimited corporate downtown building?  Do we encourage every tech company to locate on the same tiny footprint down that wants to?  

Do we want monoculture of tech companies and nothing else?  That's what we're getting.  Do we want only those making 6 figures to be able to afford to live less than 15 miles from downtown?  Because that's what we're getting.


Seattle has choices.  So far, it has chosen to gorge itself on development and growth.  That is hitting everyone who wasn't already bought-in -- by owning property, by having a 6 figure income -- pretty hard.

Do you want your barbers and bartenders and store clerks, people you meet and know and have walkable livable lives sharing with every week ... do you want those people being required to commute in 2 hours one way a day?  That's what you're building.  Do you want the only businesses in all these nice new first floor 5 over 1 neighborhood buildings like are sprouting all over SLU to only be rented by well-capitalized, corpoate-chain-style companies?  That's all who will be able to afford to, at least at current square foot rental rates that have been appearing.    Do you want there to be no police who live in the city limits?  That's what you're making.  The list goes on and on here.

"It's Econ 101. It's science. There are no politics in this fact. It's been studied. There's not a single reputable economist that will argue his point that minimum wages that are too high leads to the poorest of the poor being out of the job and an overall reduction in the work force. The majority of economists find that any minimum wage above equilibrium leads to the poorest of the poor being out of the job and an overall reduction of the workforce. There's only one major study that shows a minimum wage increasing the number of jobs, but there are numerous studies that debunk many of the points of that study these days.

To deny this is no different than denying climate change. It's a fact. But if you prefer a bunch of people in the middle getting a raise while leaving the lower tiered workers out of the job, then you should support this initiative.

"&gt; God only knows what reason it takes forever to update when you do it online

Then call me God, because I know.

ORCA cards are standalone devices.  Each card stores its balance, the status of any passes loaded, and transfers.  The card updates itself in response to commands from the reader when you tap a card at a reader.  Each reader must connect by wireless back to the main ORCA system in order to know what commands to issue to cards (""update the pass on 12345 to now expire on February 29, 2016,"" ""load $25 onto 38581,"" and so on).

Due to budget and technology constraints in 2006 when ORCA was first developed and tested, full-time wireless connectivity for all terminals was not feasible.  So the terminals on buses only talk to the network a few times a day and there are so many commands that a given terminal might not receive all commands before it moves ""out of range"" again.

Terminals like ORCA machines at light rail stops, transit centers, and grocery stores are connected full-time to the network so they can write the new balance or pass directly to the card right then.  (That's what the ticket machine is doing when it says ""loading ORCA card, do not remove."")

"Because motives speak to the man, and the man is not just coming out and saying ""let's address mental health"". It's not an accident that this came out one day after his boss in DC laid out additional gun control measures on the federal level. If we acknowledge that this city/state is criminally understaffed in terms of mental health professionals and resources, why do we have to wait for Obama to sign (more) executive orders on guns before we address it? This has nothing to do with safety or public health and everything to do with a long-standing political agenda.

These people, these politicians, are *not* your friends. They don't care if you eat a bullet or if you get lit up by some banger down in SoDo. Politicians in this state and this country in general have been pushing gun control, exploiting every tragedy that fits the talking points, since the 1994 Clinton-era assault weapons ban expired in 2004. They stand on the graves of victims while the bodies are still warm and use the dead to push an agenda that Nepolitano and Pelosi admitted has been on-paper and ready to go since before Obama even took office. And this is just a continuation of that.

Those motives indicate a person who puts DC politics before WA residents, at least in this case. Mental health is a red light and a screaming alarm in this state, and in this country. WA politicians should not be addressing problems in WA based on how Obama has prioritized his DC agenda, and WA residents should not have to embargo solutions until the people affected become politically expedient.

"&gt;Determined to lessen the toll of gun violence, Gov. Jay Inslee on Wednesday announced the state will seek to strengthen background checks by improving information sharing among agencies and reduce suicides by implementing a statewide prevention plan.

How are these linked?

&gt;Between 2012 and 2014, according to Inslee’s office, 665 people in the state died from firearm injuries, compared to 497 deaths from automobile accidents. About 80 percent of the firearm deaths were suicides, according to Inslee.

Wow, thats a ton of suicides. How many people actually got shot though, like maliciously by another person.
665-80%(524) = 141 ( over two years) or less than half that cars killed over the same period. ( wait, does this include people shot by the police? )

&gt;“Every single day, someone in the state of Washington dies from gun violence,” including from suicide, Inslee said.
Common-sense measures are needed, he said.

Yeah, that's not true, your reaching pretty hard with the suicide numbers.

&gt;In a state that has been criticized for inadequately funding mental-health services, Inslee on Wednesday talked of the need to do more in suicide prevention.

yeah no shit

&gt;He is asking for an update to a 2007 state white paper on access to firearms for those with mental illness. The white paper included recommendations that have yet to be implemented, according to Inslee’s office, such as a centralized background-check system. On Tuesday, the Obama administration proposed a $500 million investment to increase access to mental-health care.

Yikes, I hope whoever gets to decide who is mentally ill is accountable, but I doubt many people are going to push back on this.

"Would you ever do that? Because probably not, no, not unless you are presenting as female in some kind of way and also probably registered wherever this locker room is as a female. I've never been in a locker room for a facility that didn't make me sign up in some capacity, have you?

Currently it's been nine years with this policy in place and that has never happened, probably because there would be some kind of reaction to someone who was just ""saying"" they were trans entering a womens locker room and just leering,  or worse (ps assault, molestation etc are still illegal in those rooms and that hasn't changed) and when it came out you weren't at all trans you'd be banned for sure, and also probably charged with something.


 Since you're going to Google it anyway- There was in fact one incident with a trans woman in a steam room at a Washington university pool, who was accused of exposing herself to minors, which comes up a lot, but it turned out in the end the kids (age 16) were snooping where they weren't even allowed to be, rather than the trans person actually doing anything wrong. As a side note that trans woman ended up getting slandered by right wing media for months and had her name dragged through the mud, despite again, having done absolutely nothing illegal. The kids who were there for a swim meet, were not allowed anywhere near the steam room where the woman was relaxing in a towel with a cisgender female friend. The kids looked in the window of the steam room and saw under her towel, told their right wing parents later that day and began to ruin a woman's life.


Also trans people do tend to transition. So there are almost always signs, like looking physically like a woman in the secondary sex characteristics area.

You could try to do that long term, take hormones, socially transition and keep the charade up just for the glorious old lady butt you'll probably see in the locker rooms, but for serious welcome to severe gender Dysphoria and social ostracization. Not to mention just general sexism. Enjoy. 

Also not for nothing but people who would do this (pretend to be trans to gain entry to women's spaces) are by definition not trans people, so effectively you'd be punishing trans people for crimes committed by non trans people.

Personally I don't think someone who wants to get into a woman's locker room for insidious purposes would go to the trouble, since the door is just a door anyway and the little lady sign isn't a magical barrier or anything. 



P.s how exactly do you think captain crotch concern there would actually carry out this bill of his anyway? Trans people can easily get matching I.d's in Washington state, so unless everyone has to carry around a birth certificate (which you can also change) they would have to do junk checks at the door. How comfortable are you with random facility employees checking everyone's underoos before they can swim or work out?


Or should trans people be forced to wear badges? Lol. Because as we know that ALWAYS goes well, especially for a populace who currently experiences many times the violent crime rate of your average cisgender American. Publicly labeling them probably won't help that. In fact I guarantee it will put people in real danger, something trans people using the facilities that match their identity will not do.


So. No. You really couldn't. Thanks for parroting an extremely common (and unimaginative) right wing argument (read as anti trans rights dog whistle) so I could dissect it though.

One is a long-term, sustainable support system for those who live on the streets - mental healthcare, job training, counseling, housing.

The second is to immediately outlaw street/public space camping and public hoarding.  More strictly enforce property theft and drug crimes, which fuel addiction and the ability to sustain a life living on the street.

"Maybe. Taking away the license could qualify as a government taking by viewing the license as a property interest. Usually a taking triggers a need for the government to pay just compensation for the amount infringed upon. But this would be tricky, since the land could still be used for other purposes besides a dispensary. The analysis for court review also favors government action.

Alternatively, the license could be argued as an entitlement, since the businesses featured have been given a license in the past and continue to fulfill their requirements for current licensing. It also appears they already submitted applications according to posted criteria, and now that criteria is arbitrarily changing six months ahead of schedule. Both of these could be viewed as a deprivation of due process. Again, however, mere government negligence does not give rise to liability. And an aggrieved party's right to a hearing might only trigger *after* the deprivation under administrative rules. So the dispensaries would need to wait and see who actually is refused a license before taking legal action.

"Oh this is fun.

So, let me introduce you first, to a definition. The word is [preemption](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/preemption). In this case we're looking at number 3.

In Washington state almost all gun laws are ""preempted"". [RCW 9.41.290](http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9.41.290) states that government entities at a level lower than the state can not further restrict firearms outside of very specific circumstances like the public firing of them. Even ""possession"" is preempted by state law and can not be influenced by anything hosted on the domain seattle.gov. [Seattle has already tried this and been defeated in court over it.](http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/judges-ruling-ends-seattle-parks-gun-ban/)

I think it's just fucking gorgeous that you stopped copy/pasting here just before this: 

&gt;Typically, however, violators are first warned that they have violated the conditions of entry or that their privilege to be on the property has been revoked, and they are given a chance to leave before being arrested. If they continue to violate the conditions of entry or refuse to leave when asked, they may be arrested for criminal trespass. 

Let me tell you what your interpretation of the law is like. According to your interpretation of this law, if I open up a restaurant I can put up a sign that's not facing customers which says ""No cell phones"". Then if I see someone with a cell phone I can call the police without notifying the person. Then the police can come and arrest that person because they had a phone in an area with a sign that said they were not allowed.

By all means, feel free to try to get someone with a gun arrested in Washington on publicly accessible private property when they haven't been asked to leave.You don't know your local laws at all.

EDIT: I'm going to put this even more simply for you.

I ban blue shirts in my store. I post a big sign on my door that you can't miss unless you're staring at your phone as you're opening the door. I see your blue shirt and I call the police and tell them you're trespassing because you're wearing a blue shirt.

"I don't know the situation of any of those people, but I think it is a mistake to lump all of them into the bucket of drug using thieves.

I've always had a home, but not everybody is so lucky. Years ago when I was working my way through college at a restaurant on Eastlake, one of my coworkers let is slip that she was living in her car, and had been for a couple of weeks -- I don't recall her details... I think she was new to the area and saving money for a deposit on a place -- but if you don't have a family based social safety net (or a friend based one I suppose) -- life can be very, very hard. (I was living with my grandparents at the time -- I was lucky). But this happened back when housing prices in Seattle weren't outrageous... I can't imagine being a person today trying to make it here without a place to live.

I'll admit I've called the cops to shoo away an RV that was parked on my street many years ago -- I didn't like the idea of people loitering there 24 hours a day, and throwing trash on the parking strip... thinking back on that now... watching the couple drive off with the police watching them... I feel a little ashamed. I cared more about my property values than I did about two humans. (And I realized later that trash wasn't from them. It was from a neighborhood kid that walked by my house everyday and threw away his after school snack wrapper in my yard -- and it was from the weekly trash pickup... because trash wafts out of those trash trucks often on their pickup routes; added as an edit).

I don't know what the answer is... but I think it might help to think of the homeless as humans, and not just as drug using thieves that are staking out our homes.

Sure, some of these humans are where they are in life due to poor choices and drug use, but some of them were just dealt a very rough hand in life.",,,,boi88,,,1453234164,t5_2qhad,t3_41noef,t3_41noef,10,1454596448,0,0,cz4az1t,Seattle,10,,

"&gt;I'm just seeing a lot of liberal vs. conservative comments and I don't think it's that simple.

I also feel there are too many guns. 

Those are your opinions, and you have a right to them. I don't personally believe we should legislate on the basis of feelings.

&gt;Those guns are making their way into the hands of those who use them in crimes and even more so are making their way out of our borders and into other countries.

The attempts to make a link between new sales, and ""finding their way into the hands of criminals"" is flawed and ignores real issues in between like enforcement. Charges for possession of a stolen firearm, and straw purchases are rare, skim any article from the Seattle times on shootings and read the charges. The US government is the largest arms dealer in the world, changing civilian laws would have little effect on that.

* no bathrooms or showers for each room, instead shared by the whole floor. Only one bathroom per floor, so the men's bathroom was a floor upstairs

* no Wi-Fi and poor cell service through most of the building

* central heating either way too hot or a little too cold, no control of room vents. We could open windows but that only does so much, even in winter.

* asbestos warnings on everything

* not enough laundry machines

* poorly lit inside of building

* not enough bike room capacity

"&gt; Can people please stop asking ""what will happen when it reaches the viaduct"" 

No. And add downtown to that list. 

Have you forgotten that, according to all of this project's proponents, the viaduct was already so unsafe that this project had to be fast tracked so the viaduct could be torn down by 2012 for the safety of Seattle residents? 

That was before the settling that has already happened, and the fact that there *still* is no known answer to how much more settlement will make the viaduct unsafe to travel. 

Then add the fact that [**yesterday Dixon admitted that they were not monitoring the soil for sinkholes or settlement after Bertha's breakdown**](http://crosscut.com/2016/01/a-huge-sinkhole-just-opened-up-downtown/) because they were placing a ""tremendous amount of focus on how the machine was functioning"" to the exclusion of other critical matters, evidently. Dixon admitted that ""some might consider"" that an oversight. Ya think?!

So yes, when dealing with a state agency notorious for poorly managed projects, a contractor notorious for overpromising, underdelivering and escaping financial responsibility for overruns, and who evidently gets distracted and stops paying attention to critical safety issues, I'm shocked that more people aren't demanding an adequate answer to that question.

I'm also shocked that you so cavalierly dismiss that they ""they fucked up their soil monitoring protocols."" If there's something everyone knows they shouldn't have done, it's that. Yet they did. And they have a history of doing that. [They're also notorious for escaping financial responsibility for cost overruns](http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/tunnel-partner-known-to-fight-tough-with-public-agencies/).

Once this goes under the viaduct, any soil and structural problems could be devastating the safety of our residents and harmful to our economy.

My street wasn't perpetually littered with trash and discarded Four Loko cans (still waiting for a some environmentalist Seattlite to address that one). My sidewalks weren't covered in broken car window glass, nobody broke into my car to steal my shit, I didn't feel the need to walk my female guests half a block to their cars, I didn't have shirtless psycho junkies hanging out in front of my building  screaming at my elderly mother while she just wanted to get in her car and leave. I didn't have to walk over piles of human shit on the sidewalk alongside the paper bag someone used to wipe his ass, or the baggies and needles in the doorways of businesses that the business owners then get to clean up because some junkie decided to get high and bed down on their stoop. My roommate didn't get assaulted by some hobo meth freak outside Wendys. I could go to 7-11 without the entire unwashed population of central Ballard hitting me up for money and cigarettes, like the seagulls from Finding Nemo.

Things have gotten much worse. My friends who visit from other parts of the city or the state who have never lived in Ballard even comment on it. And, frankly, most of the misguided do-gooders (like our mayor) who are pushing for these homeless camps and RV lots DONT FUCKING LIVE HERE!

"I don't like being told that I am required to ""Tip"" a certain amount. Servers make plenty of money (if they are decent) while the cooks slave away in the kitchen in a much more stressful and demanding environment. 

The problem is that most restaurants do NOT tip out back of house (BOH) The restaurant I work at does and it helps even out the wages some. It is a small restaurant with a max capacity at 50 people. We keep 3 servers and a host on busy nights (~$3,500 sales) and servers will walk out with NO LESS than $150 for 5 hours worth of work on top of their hourly ($9 and some change) so a little under $200 in 5 hours. A cook IF LUCKY gets $15hr x 8 = $120. Most guys are around $12 x 8 = $96. Servers tip out 2.5% of total sales to BOH so $3,500 x 2.5% = $87.50 divided equally to the 4 BOH employees on the clock. Roughly ~$22 per person. 

Source: Have worked BOH and FOH for over 8 years in various restaurants.

Canlis IIRC is the only restaurant that does it the proper way. All the tips are totaled together and split equally. Working in a restaurant is a team experience and this is the only way that I see it working at other places. Requiring a ""Tip charge"" hopefully doesnt stick around for too long.

"You're confusing cause and effect. 

Development doesn't cause increased rents.  Increased rents cause development.  Those increased rents make the development economically viable - without them it would never happen because it would be a money losing proposition.

Increased rents are caused by increased demand and/or constrained supply.  That increased demand is caused by people moving to the area, because big employers are here - that are healthy and hiring.  

That is to say, in effect, having a good economy causes increased demand for housing.  

Seattle has a constrained supply of housing, and growing demand.  Some of those constraints are geographical, some of them are (good) environmental laws, and some of them [a significant chunk of them] are (bad) zoning laws.  

Seattle's obsession with single-family-detached housing is one of the largest drivers of the loss of affordability because its strangling the ability to build additional supply - which is the only way to deal with demand in excess of supply.  

Also traffic issues make this worse - if our transit system was more complete and we could move around between areas of the sound more freely and quickly then you can spread out the new demand over larger areas.  You can't increase traffic lanes to abate this (past 2-3 each way on a highway it just makes no fucking difference), you have to build transit.

"No, actually. WSDOT and other engineers definitely raised the issue, but STP never adequately prepared for it, which was confirmed by Dixon yesterday.

[Dixon admitted that STP didn't have any program or monitoring in place to detect or proactively prevent sinkholes](http://crosscut.com/2016/01/a-huge-sinkhole-just-opened-up-downtown/), even though they're a known risk that STP has been questioned about for years:

&gt; The logical follow up question, though, was what happens when Bertha has to take a right turn under the elevated Highway 99? Could the public be confident it won’t happen again?

&gt; “With the program we’re putting in place, yes,” said Dixon, “because we’ll be able to detect if anything could lead to something like this and we’ll be in a position to take immediate corrective action.”

&gt; So why wasn’t that program in place already? Leading up Bertha’s stall, Dixon said that crews were using sensors to keep a close eye out for any voids in the soil that could lead to settlement. But since Bertha busted through her repair pit, “We placed a tremendous amount of focus on how the machine was functioning.” Soil monitoring, in other words, took a back seat.

&gt; When asked if this was an oversight, Dixon said, “Some might consider it.”

The sinkhole issue is only one of [the major, fundamental questions that were asked before the project began that still don't have adequate answers](http://slog.thestranger.com/slog/archives/2014/12/16/guest-editorial-seattle-pull-the-plug-on-the-tunnel-unless-you-can-answer-these-seven-questions).

"First:  The supreme court declared that sleeping is a basic human need, and that anywhere it's legal to be, it's legal to sleep.  Thus making most cities rousting of sleeping homeless illegal.

The entire concept of the ""free market"" only exists to explain the economics of commodity goods in a perfectly informed marketplace. Where every buyer had identical power and every seller had identical goods. Beyond that? Your results start to get skewed by the forces of reality, and to try to expand those simplistic principles into something as dynamic and diverse as a national economy is like.. the dumbest thing you can try to do.

"We don't have to reduce the number of single family owners to achieve more density. The idea that we need to convert any single family lots to upzoned areas for six story condo and apartment complexes is an unfortunate outcome of the inability of our collective citizenry to work together to craft a sustainable solution.

In fact, we can achieve some of our increased density demands by increasing the number of single family owners within our residential neighborhoods. To me, growing our base of middle class ownership in our city, is as important as allowing for more density, and we should be finding solutions to assure affordable housing not just for the low income, but for everybody.

As I age and approach retirement, I don't want to be priced out of my house. It will be paid off in another 8 years, but I don't want to be priced out of it by ever growing taxes, and maintenance costs; but this will happen if we don't all work together to protect our urban livability.

So, my idea, is to allow for more small housing variety in our single family neighborhoods. The era where our single family houses are filled with 2 parents and 2.5 children are long gone, and we don't need more 3,400 square foot single family houses on 7,000 square foot lots -- instead -- we need more 1,200 square foot homes on 3,500 square foot lots. Such homes are ideal for the singles and couples, and households with 1 child that now represent the fastest growing segments of our  demographic patterns.

Current zoning in our single family areas currently require lots to be at least 5,000 square feet, which is curious given the fact that the average lot size in my neighborhood (South Maple Leaf) is actually closer to 4,000 square feet -- and the most common lot size is closer to 3,000 square feet. This 5,000 SF magic number grew out of a backlash against ""skinny houses"" as they were called in the 80s -- and the city council rushed through reactionary legislation to prevent developers from tearing down small houses on large lots, and dividing the lot and then building 2 long narrow houses on the newly formed lots. Residents in the 80s objected to these skinny houses in their neighborhoods, and put pressure on the city council to take the action they did.

Now, I'm not advocating for more skinny houses, but honestly, they are more in character with our neighborhood, than that alternative that are being built today -- which are the 4,000 square foot homes with 5 bedrooms and 4 bathrooms and a listing price of 1.7 million. And why are developers and land owners building such houses? Because we don't let them divide the lot, so in order for them or the existing homeowner to maximize their return on investment -- they have to build as large as they are allowed. In other words, our zoning rules are a large cause to this explosion of unaffordable houses.

To me, our neighborhood would be much better off with 2 affordable houses on 2 smaller lots, than one giant and unaffordable house on one giant lot. I know people will push back and say these smaller lots threaten the tree canopy or our views -- but it really makes no sense to me that we can't fix this. We can lower the height limit for new houses from 32-35 feet, down to 20-24 feet. We can also create better incentives to get citizens to plant and maintain more trees.

Well, this has gotten way too long, but that is my humble opinion, as a person that has owned a home here for 22 years, and lives 1 block away from the home that his grandparents owned in the 50s and 60s.

"I really don't understand this grievance with people. What difference does it make to the customer how their money is being spent at this point?  Either you're paying a 19% tip automatically, or you're unknowingly paying a 19% tip in the form of 19% higher ""food costs"" which in turn is going to the servers anyway.

Am I missing something here?

I get that people don't like having to automatically tip a waiter because ""they might be a bad waiter and not deserve it"", but on the flip side, there were plenty of people who didn't tip a really good server well just because they didn't want to. 

I'd much rather the tip be automatic and then if there truly is a problem with the server, enough complaints will end up with them being demoted or fired. 

Please note that this doesn't even affect me anymore because I live in Canada now and don't work in the industry, but I did when I was in Seattle and I honestly cannot tell you how many times I got stuffed because of either foreigners who don't understand tipping, or people who said how amazing I was but still only left me $5 on a $150 cheque.

"I think it is okay to feel ambivalence about zoos. Their history is wrought with all kinds of ethical dilemmas. However, we have to appreciate how far zoos have come in the past 40 years. Many of the advances in zoo husbandry were actually started right here at the WPZ (I do not work there, just a zoo history buff). 

In general, zoo animals live long and , if not necessarily happy, at least comfortable lives. Some animals do exhibit stereotypic behaviors and many zoos are trying to expand their enrichment programs to keep their charges from developing psychological pathologies. Other animals, like elephants and orcas, do not fare as well in captivity as they do in the wild, but most animals in zoos do quite well. 

Further, the better zoos (and usually those with more funds) are proactive in supporting and even carrying out field conservation programs where the animals still have suitable habitat. The Woodland Park Zoo, along with the Wildlife Conservation Society in NYC and the SDZ are all quite active in conservation. 

We can argue over the morality of animal exploitation for profit, but most American zoos aren't especially egregious about this, save for places like Sea World or the Dallas World Aquarium. It could also be argued that exploiting humans for profit or keeping pets is equally morally dubious, after all. 

Also, not everyone has the money to travel or spend large amounts of time tracking animals. Zoos offer access to wildlife that that is otherwise difficult to obtain. Even field biologists can spend months in an animal's habitat without ever seeing anything. Seeing pictures or videos doesn't quite give you the same feeling as seeing directly into a tiger's eyes, even if it is through plate glass.

As loathesome and irresponsible as Tim Eyman is, I think he speaks to larger problems with the initiative process in this state. There are really four issues that keep cropping up: 1) unconstitutional initiatives 2) paid vs. volunteer signature gatherers 3) unfunded mandates and 4) changing rules. #1 is fairly easy to deal with by simply requiring that all initiatives go through the state supreme court before going on the ballot. #2 is trickier, but you could relax the threshold for the number of signatures needed when an initiative uses only volunteers. #3 is tough, since requiring revenue neutrality would often run into the single-issue requirement, but I have a feeling that clever lawyers could find a way of making it work.

"I don't know if I'd say High Voltage itself ""helped build Seattle"" but...

I've been an actively gigging/recording musician in Seattle for 20 years, and I, like hundreds (thousands?) of other Seattle musicians, rehearsed at the Chophouse (originally Chophaus) for years and years. (one stint from maybe 1998 to 2004 and another from like 2010 until it's demolition) A lot of us lived on the Hill, played venues around the Hill and Downtown/Belltown etc, and rehearsed on the Hill. Walking around the area, you'd run into fellow musicians and artists all the time.

The closing of the Chophouse and High Voltage (which I really liked, it'll be missed) are just symptomatic of a big cultural shift on Capitol Hill. Musicians and other artists are no longer setting the tone. It's been a really pronounced change especially in the last decade. 

I have no desire to get into arguments about how this has to happen in any growing city; it's just sad to feel like as a musician-ey type the neighborhood you used to feel a real sense of belonging to has gone away.

"No, I don't have a degree in economics; the doctorate I'm working on is in 19th century American history.
The people I study lived in your magical world of 'auto-correcting markets (whatever the hell that's supposed to mean)' and no minimum wages and for a large number of them they lived horrific lives in no small part because of the hellishness of unregulated markets.  
Injured at work? Too bad, good luck, you knew that it was a risky job.
In perpetual debt to the company store? Well, at least that means we can throw you in jail when you strike for better conditions.  Owned by your boss? Well, the free market in human beings is a cherished right. 
The only place you can actually see the market building higher wages to compensate for a higher standard of living is in the California Gold Rush, where workers were paid well to compensate for extraordinarily costly living conditions.  If you look at the urban east coast, however, you see a major decline in workers living standards from the turn of the century until the Civil War, as mass migration, the decline of skilled artisinal labor, and the rise of the factory meant longer work, less pay, and lower purchasing power.",,,,Anoraklibrarian,,,1452552068,t5_2qhad,t3_40iva5,t1_cyukbpm,78,1454428521,0,0,cyul41s,Seattle,78,,

"Oh, they do.

A decade ago my grandmother had a complaint and a visit as well as a follow-up inspection at a later time related to stuff growing too far out into the sidewalks.  The city doesn't jump to the fine, but that would have resulted if the follow-up wasn't given a ""satisfactory"".

There's a house up the street that did get fines.... it's searchable under the dpd file for that address.

First pass is generally they mail out a flier [like this](http://i.imgur.com/FyJpJBk.jpg) and may do a visit to validate the complaint.


I've also filed a complaint when a house a few blocks away had overgrown weeds and a post-wreck car parked over the sidewalk for months.  I believe they had an option to report the outcome back and so I got a phone call from the DPD a few weeks later.  Things got cleaned up and the car was taken away.


Unfortunately, taking out someone's tree without permission could get bad, real quick.

"This isn't surprising.

Heavy, clunky, time-limited bikes (seriously, 30 minutes?  wtf?) aren't particularly appealing to people who don't want to bike in the first place.

And the people who might want to ride something like that probably already own something radically better themselves, and take it instead of renting a city bike.

If they'd added electric bikes, it would have helped make the bikes much easier to ride, since the weight stops mattering nearly as much.  And a 30 minute rental cycle means you don't even need a large battery.  300W motor, 200Wh pack, and you can run flat out between charges without running the pack flat.

But, they didn't.  And anyone who's likely to be interested in riding an electric bike to get around almost certainly has their own - I wouldn't use a rental ebike from something like this, because my commuter ebike is radically better for me than any sort of rental.

"Many Churches already do help in many many ways. If you aren't affiliated with a church you might not know that. (ps my husband is an atheist so I don't care what you do or don't believe, my point is that you might not know) Churches help quite a bit, at least the ones I know about on the Eastside. I don't know as much about Seattle proper though, but I assume there are similar programs. There are many churches helping in many ways within the greater Seattle area. Homelessness is NOT just a Seattle thing. 

Here is a list of services I personally know of:

Congregations for the Homeless:  My church RUMC for the entire month on January host a homeless men's temporary shelter for 20-40 men nightly. This has in annual occurrence of at least 15 years ie I remember helping my parents in junior high and I'm now 32. My friend's and I are making the nightly dinner on Sunday: Tacos. It is not a drop-in Shelter, every man has a case manager to give assistance to get men back on their feet. I don't know much more about how to get in the program. Anyone can donate time/money/a nightly meal. Volunteers do not have to be associated with any religion, they just have to want to help. This shelter rotates around the eastside to different churches.
http://www.cfhomeless.org/ 

Sophia Way:  Also on the eastside. Women's Shelter. Hosted at Bellevue UMC. Before they had a permanent location my church also opened our doors and hosted it for a month.
http://sophiaway.org/shelter-tonight/ 

Tent Citys:  Hosted at Bear Creek UMC. I don't know much about this program but I know that last week when I drove by they were there. A similar or same program was at a different church across the street from Lake Washington high school a couple of months back. Usually things like this have to move every 6 months due to permits with the city. 
http://www.sharewheel.org/Home/tent-cities

YWCA: My church sponsors a 'apartment' at the YWCA in Redmond. This is transitional housing for families and single mothers. Usually they are there for 6-18 months. We supply a full pantry with kitchen items, blankets, full backpacks at the start of school and Christmas gifts during the holiday season. Furniture is provided with the apartment.
https://www.ywcaworks.org/page.aspx?pid=441

Open Kitchen: Every wednesday my church hosts a meal for anyone who needs it. I have not volunteered much so I don't know how it works exactly but it's free and it helps support the community with food. If you have to choose between food and rent this helps you keep a bit more for your rent.

"I'm a certified officer in WA State, offering my opinion anonymously for obvious reasons. 

From the comfort of my living room couch, I can confidently say I wouldn't have punched her after she kicked me. I would try to close the patrol car door, and MAYBE use pain compliance techniques to keep her in and get the door closed after the assault. A great example of SPD responding appropriately can be found here: http://youtu.be/DWj_vKMNMDU (at 11:26, the suspect spits on an officer). 

To be reasonable though, the totality of circumstances should be considered. The officer had probable cause to arrest her, and she resisted from the moment the officer tried to handcuff her. He used no force (despite the fact that he could have easily legally used force) and handcuffed her. 

At the point of the assault (the kick), the officer responds immediately with a punch. Punching her wasn't the least intrusive reaction, but it's certainly effective to end the assault and bring the situation under control. It can be argued that it was reasonable and necessary, but certainly not proportional...and thus the violation of policy. 

In my eyes, there's no denying that the officer violated policy. Since the time of this indecent, he's been sitting at home every workday wondering if he's going to be fired. 

Sorry folks, admin leave is no vacation. You can't leave home during work hours, and you spend your time wondering if the world is fixing to come crashing down on your shoulders. Regardless, at this point he's realized that he could have done better, and he's got a ton of time invested working in South Seattle. 

If I were Chief...30 Days suspended without pay, and a probationary period in which one screw up results in termination. He screwed up, but it was a reaction to a violent assault.

Sure, some workers are crappy. And like any other industry, if they're continually crappy, they lose the job.

"&gt; In Switzerland gun owners have had military training. In Switzerland you are not allowed to keep ammunition with the guns. In Switzerland you must keep your gun in a safe.

I am for compulsory firearms training starting around middle school so we have that covered. Ammunition does not have to be locked up seperatly, you are thinking of the governement supplied ammunition which is there in case of emergency not so you can dick around at the range, that is counted and monitored. private ammunition purchase is legal if you have a fire arm, there is not a background check they ask to see your firearms card. 

&gt; Tell me, what would you do if the 2A was repealed then?

Depends what they replaced it with. If they wanted a confinscation I would not hand in my guns and seek to remove that government as quickly as possible. Like you saw around the country when they try laws like this a lot of recall elections. I may not even need to move PA has been moving heavily in favor of more rights. 

&gt; Plus PA and DE are nearby which have much looser gun laws. NJ itself isn't a particular heavy gun control state either.

You never lived in Jersey it is insane to try and get a permit there and the police can actively work against you. There was just a sting by pro rights  groups showing how officers lied to perspective applicants all the time. When I moved to PA for a couple semesters they made some of the guns and ammo I own illegal, I can't move back to Jersey now or I would face over 40 years in jail.

"FAA Seattle TRACON guy here, this pilot has it correct.

A lot of days, days like today, visibility is so shit both vertically and horizontally that you can't see the airport until you're within 100 yards of it.

But when runway RVR is 300ft, you can have a line of aircraft extending 10-15 miles north of the Space needle. Despite ILS technology giving a pilot descent rate, there are several factors that could cause a plane to descend below their recommended altitude. Not to mention, in emergency situations, you don't want anything getting in the way of that airplane at all. Imagine a plane with an engine fire due to bird strike, losing altitude, and barely enough power to maintain altitude. Do you really want that flying within a mile of your fancy 102 story building?

Far better and more comfortable to wear a waterproof layer on your outside.  If you can't afford one just poke some holes in a garbage bag - serious, it works and you'll save $100.

Also bear in mind that Si and other mountains around here will have snow and ice cover towards the top.  Take it easy and don't struggle up what you can't get down.

If you want a nice hike that's safe, easy and accessible, try West Tiger 3, then towards peak 2, then peak 1.  Not as much elevation as Si but a great view from Tiger 1, and nobody will be there.  ",,,,2-4-decadienal5,,,1452710374,t5_2qhad,t3_40tbwc,t3_40tbwc,23,1454468500,0,0,cywwgjo,Seattle,23,,

In some places, the wait staff does not want to bother or rush you.  You are expected as a customer to signal for them.  When you want the bill or other service, you flag them down and make your needs known.  They are around, but do not choose to approach you because they don't want to be seen as interrupting you.

In the US, the wait experience is that we expect the servers to check in ""Is everything ok?"" ""Can I get you a refill?"" ""If there's nothing else, here's the bill."" etc. This can at times seem like the customer is being rushed from seating to out the door and fielding multiple interruptions.

"There's a fascinating documentary that came out about ten years ago, called [The Bridge](http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-bridge). The filmmakers talked to people involved in suicides or attempts off the Golden Gate Bridge--families and friends of people who'd jumped, people who were stopped from jumping, and a handful of people who'd jumped and miraculously survived--as well as mental health professionals and people who study suicide. They also had a video camera trained on the bridge for an entire year, and captured several jumps. It sounds morbid and exploitative, but it really isn't--in fact, it's a very life-affirming movie. I highly recommend it.

They talked about one argument that always comes up when there's talk of erecting a suicide barrier to keep people from jumping:  if you stop them now, they'll just keep trying until they find a way to get it done. It turns out...sometimes yes, but not as often as you might think. For many people, the desire to end their lives is a temporary impulse--if they don't succeed, for a lot of them, it passes (the people who jumped and lived to tell the tale have some fascinating things to say about that).  Their lives don't get magically better, but they often decide that living them really is better than that alternative.

So, by engaging this guy and keeping him talking until the police got there, you may have saved his life--not just until he gets out and is free to try again, but long-term.

It is subject to the framework that the people put in place to establish limitations on what the different branches of government can do and to grant certain powers to it in the interest of governance.   If the people want to change those limitations and powers then they can amend the constitution.   A court can't overturn a constitutional amendment (unless it is a federal court and it runs afoul of the Federal constitution.)",,,,t4lisker,,,1453406384,t5_2qhad,t3_421lcf,t1_cz6vizp,57,1454640933,0,0,cz6vtwv,Seattle,57,,

"&gt; Even though Australia's violent crime didn't drop that much,

There is emerging evidence its actually going up in Australia.

&gt; the suicide rate dropped significantly after their gun laws changed.

Tying gun laws to suicide rates is really strange when you consider the countries with the highest suicide rates, often ban guns completely, like Japan. Its almost like they aren't truly related issues. The reason suicide gets dragged into it, is because if we remove those deaths, guns plummet off the causes of death charts. ( even with they aren't in the top 100 in the CDC data)

&gt; You need a license for a car. You need a license to fly a plane. We require licenses for everything...except guns. Good ole 2nd amendment.

The car analogy is totally broken, I wish people would stop using it. I can buy any car I want, as long as I don't drive it on public roads. I can't buy any firearm I want, regardless of if it never leaves my property. Also, other than being blind there are almost no restrictions on who can get a auto license, you can fail the test a 1000 times, pass once, and keep it for life.

Someone convicted of killing someone else with a car would never be barred from owning a car. ( drunks )",,,,meaniereddit,West Seattle,,1452554463,t5_2qhad,t3_40iskn,t1_cyum7gc,13,1454429322,0,0,cyumo1e,Seattle,13,,flair
