"I complain and argue a lot in this sub about how hard it is to find good/legit American-Mexican* in this state. (*As in Texmex or Calimex, which is basically what we're all talking about here and aaaaanyway)

Taco Time is more than alright with me. They're like the In-n-Out of the taco world. They seem to treat their employees well, they give a fuck about their customers, they even try to minimize their own trash/paper stream, they keep a solid, simple menu and focus on it.

Their baja style fish tacos actually are pretty damn good, very close to fully legit. I mean, yeah, they're bulk fast food and could only ever possibly be so good.

But they're damn near spot on. The only way they could be more legit is if they were made out of freshly caught fish, cornmeal/masa and beer battered and fried right there on the beach with some fresh cabbage and slaw and you had sea-salt all over your face from being in the ocean all day.

Ok, maybe I'm exaggerating. But they actually remind me of surfing Rosarita as a kid and stuffing my face with fresh fish tacos from a little shack or trailer on the beach. Just real crisp, clean and simple little fish tacos.

The rest of it isn't terrible, either. Sure, it's not a true el carbon joint like Tacos Mexico, but it's a fuckton better than Taco Bell or Del Taco.

Their salsa rojo is pretty damn legit, too. Sweet and smoky and plenty of kick but not too acidic, either.

As for the ""Mexinuggets?"" That shit's racist, and hella weird, yo! Like Minnesota hotdish weird. What the fuck is Mexican about tater tots?

But it's mainly cancelled out due to tater tots being awesome in an actual fryer, with bonus points for having sweet potato tater tots. Because those things are fucking delicious and actually go fine with some tacos.

And, yeah, the fountain drinks are usually pretty awesome.

Speaking of Taco Bell and Del Taco, they both have sucked for a long time. Since the early to mid 80s, at least.

The one that should have won out from the same birthplace and era was Naugles, which was a lot like Taco Time, but probably with a more complicated menu like a Del Taco.

"Actually, we can see *exactly* when the video was reviewed, thanks to SPD's recent decision to post the entire database of in-car video logs at https://data.seattle.gov/Public-Safety/COBAN-Logs/tpvk-5fr3

The video we're looking for will have a filename of the form 6229@20140709hhmmss, where hhmmss are around 13:04:50. (6229 is Whitlatch's serial number, 20140709 is the date, and you can guess the rest.) Oddly enough, there's two: 6229@20140709130427 and 6229@20140709130428. (definitely a bug in the in-car video system. my guess is it saved two copies of the same video.)

Anyway, [here](https://data.seattle.gov/Public-Safety/Wingate/ipfy-b6ju) is the log.

Rows worth highlighting:

Row 3. Shows Whitlatch reviewed the video herself about two hours after the incident. (ICP = in-car playback)

Row 10. Shows the first person other than Whitlatch to look at the video was user # 6563 on 7/22. Serial # 6563 is Jason Hardi, an admin specialist in the public records unit.

Row 13. shows on 7/23, user T054 (a temp employee) exported a copy of the video to DVD for Hardi.

Row 15. On 8/06, user 5075 (Robert Garniss) exported a DVD copy for Renee Salzgiver of the city law department. (Salzgiver's job title, according to LinkedIn, is ""Discovery Clerk"", so most likely this was the city turning over the video to Wingate's attorney(s).

Row 17. On 9/15, user 7065 (a tech in the video unit) exported a copy for Deputy Chief Carmen Best. **This is kind of a big deal.** I have been studying this body of data since 2011, and I have never seen a single instance of a DVD being shipped directly to anyone at commander level like this before.

Row 19. On 9/17, user 4297 (another video unit tech) made new copies for the city attorney's office apparently because they lost the old ones.

Row 21. Reference is made to city claim 90196. More info about city claims [here](http://www.seattle.gov/filing-a-damage-claim)

Row 22. On 12/30, user 6130 (yet another video unit tech) played it back and then exported a copy for David Strom in the records section.

"The difference between the constitutionality of tobacco advertising band and marijuana advertising ban isn't centred on the notion that marijuana is any less harmful than cigarettes.

Rather, tobacco advertising isn't completely banned. It is illegal to advertise on television and radio, as well as some public places (large billboards and on public buses). It is not illegal to advertise in print, inside of shops, and in other place so long as they do not specifically target minors. I think similar laws are in place for alcohol (though it can be advertised on TV), and probably other controlled substances.

By comparison, the ban currently in place on marijuana advertising makes all advertising illegal. The notion is that this kind of total ban is not constitutional, even on a controlled substance.

"(EDITED to set worried minds at ease, I hope.)

These photos are from the MLK day protests on Westlake Ave on the 19th.

The guy shown here is having a Zapruder moment: he is recording an important incident from a clear, unobstructed position, and may not even realize what he got on video.

If anyone knows him, please ~~put us in touch~~ ask him to get in touch with me. Anonymously is fine. I am **not** seeking any personal info about him, and he is not in any kind of trouble.

Some more info:

The incident he's filming is the alleged assault on an SPD officer for which two people were arrested. According to SPD, the officer was grabbed and shoved, resulting in a significant injury. According to protesters, the officer fell over his own bicycle while shoving it at a protester. The video that these images were taken from has a lot of obstruction in the foreground. But this guy has a clear, unobstructed view of things, and the hope is that his footage can settle the questions about what really happened.

If you think I am working for the cops, review my Reddit posts from April 2010.

"Yes. We (generally) may not be a culture that wants English to be the ""official language"" but we do want invasive Californians to respect our culture by trying to understand it and adapting to it.

Also, keep in mind, that until the 80s, Seattle was kind of isolated. Specific, unique cultures/places/arts/buildings were created and flourished. I don't know what part of California you are from, but many parts of California (especially southern California) have always undergone rapid population booms/growth, change, economic investments. (Drives to make certain Cali cities more ""cosmopolitan."") With this, there has often been similar movements to protect culture and people, but there has been so much cultural and population turnover so much of the culture the Cali's may be trying to preserve is not really that old. 

Locals here have seen a massive amount of change in the last three decades that they hadn't seen in like, fifty years before. It's harder and harder to find generations of families here whose ancestors lived here, because they can't afford to live here. This gets even more touchy/infuriating when you start talking about people who are minorities, because of the history of systemic racism.

So to answer your question, yes. It is a big deal. I beg you, please go to MOHAI, read [History Link](http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=results.cfm&amp;keyword=Seattle-town), wander around neighborhoods and notice the architecture and the historical periods. I don't *think* you'd ask this question if you took the time to get to understand and get to know our history. Hurry though, soon there won't be much history left.

I don't know if you have any culture that you celebrate or honor (historical, religious, cultural, Festivus, whatever), but can you understand why we wouldn't like mom and pop's (RIP Catfish Corner) being taken out for ugly condos or American Apparel? 

PS I tried to keep things factual and fair, but I keep finding trash (especially disposable cups) labeled ""Amazon"" and ""Microsoft"" along my run route and my new neighbor from California just planted English Ivy in her yard (I'm not a violent person, but I nearly punched her)... so it was rather difficult.

The thing that was new to me in 2014 was getting harassed by queers for being a bro (any straight male is one I guess), getting pushed and told to ""get off their hill"".  

The idea that this art is helping in any way is bullshit.  It is intentionally aggressive and offensive, and will accomplish the opposite of what these people should want - more understanding, compassion, and support from those they consider ""outsiders"".  

The idea that the hill has to be homogenously ""queer"" or ""weird"" or whatever is bullshit.  I personally think it speaks volumes toward the acceptance of GLBTAWhatever that so many ""normals"" are willing to live in a ""gay""/""weird""/""alt"" area.

"Well, let's put it this way... Taking on the police union is a risk without reward. You risk the union opposing you politically by blaming rising crime rates on what you did, and whatever you tried to do was blocked by the union during negotiations anyway.  
  
Sure, an ethical person would take up the fight anyway on principle... but we're talking about political beings here, and no political advisor worth their salt would support taking that risk.  
  
But, let's look at the situation in NYC and compare it to Seattle. The reason the NYC thing is dying down is because the head of the union made a mistake, he didn't turn the issue into a bargaining chip during negotiations and pissed off his membership who wanted better equipment and money, not headlines and photo ops of cops turning their backs on the mayor at funerals instead of mourning for their own.  
  
Seattle's union is pretty savvy and patient, they didn't go heavy handed like NYPD, they are being subtle, letting public outrage over crime build while quietly making the argument that their officers are too afraid of the federal oversight to do anything above the minimum effort required of them... an argument that is difficult to debunk when dealing with an average citizen who implicitly trusts the police.

"Wow that is outrageous and a good argument in favor of police cams. That man did nothing wrong in the video. But even if he had swung it up in the air or whatever as she claimed, he is an elderly man not close to the officer, and she is an armed police officer. There is no reason a situation like that needs to escalate.

This is an example of an ""us vs them"" attitude that is terrible for the police-citizen relationship. I can understand why some police officers may feel besieged in the media and what not, but that's part of the job and cops need to get over the attitude that everybody is out to get them.

Finally, this is much better-than-usual reporting by The Stranger and the article itself is admirably objective, especially for The Stranger. But I gotta say that is a shitty headline that if not race-baiting comes pretty close. I agree that racial profiling is a problem, but the media does a disservice if every incident involving an innocent black person is blamed on racism. I think the shock of this story stands on its own just fine without making it a race thing. Not all shitty cops are racist, some of them are just shitty.

*edit ahead of the downvotes: Regarding the headline, I do suspect race profiling here. But my rage here is not at how the police treat a black person, it's at how this officer behaved at all.

"I got the impression that there were pretty much two categories of Bellevue families, which made a tremendous difference in their behavior. (Yes, I realize I'm generalizing. Obviously, there were exceptions!). #1: The genuine tech nerds - mathematicians, serious engineers, IT people... They were some of the nicest, most intelligent people I've ever met, and I'm still in touch with many of them. A lot of them live in Bellevue simply because it has such good schools and because it's close to their workplace. Some of the moms were housewives but not a single one of them struck me as vain, entitled, or self-absorbed. They took a genuine interest in their kids as well - some of the engineer dads, too, spend all their free time building cool gadgets with their children or helping our in the robotics programs. A really nerdy bunch, and genuinely awesome. Took their kids camping, instilled respect and good work ethic, had fun together as a family. Now, for #2: business sharks, lawyers, or people in other really fancy jobs. The level of ignorance and entitlement displayed by these people was absolutely startling. They were often very out of touch with their children, medicated the hell out of them so they'd function, focused exclusively on making their kids look good so they'd get into prestigious schools (never mind the toll that kind of thing took on the kids!).

That is not my experience in Seattle though.

"I just did a quick search for a link between sulfur smell and earthquakes.  I found quite a few hits but almost all were from disreputable sources.

But I did find [this report](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20226499), and now I'm just a *wee* bit uneasy:

&gt; A catastrophic earthquake, namely the 921-earthquake, occurred with a magnitude of M(L)=7.3 in Taiwan on September 21, 1999, causing severe disaster. The evaluation of real-time air-quality data, obtained by the Taiwan Environmental Protection Administration (EPA), revealed **a staggering increase in ambient SO(2) concentrations by more than one order of magnitude across the island several hours prior to the earthquake, particularly at background stations**. The abrupt increase in SO(2) concentrations likely resulted from seismic-triggered degassing instead of air pollution. An additional case of a large earthquake (M(L)=6.8), occurring on March 31, 2002, was examined to confirm our observations of significantly enhanced SO(2) concentrations in ambient air prior to large earthquakes. The coincidence between large earthquakes and increases in trace gases during the pre-quake period (several hours) indicates the potential of employing air-quality monitoring data to forecast catastrophic earthquakes.

There are local companies in Seattle working on rolling gigabit to homes and businesses in every form (full disclosure, I work for one of them).  None are armed with anything approaching the resources that Google has at its disposal, and none are asking the city to finance their capex, either.

Just food for thought before we start giving up the farm.  :)

It doesn't make sense for all intersections but it would sure help at the ones with a lot of people and car traffic.

I've noticed more intersections are being designated as no turn on red, but when the light turns green, the entire light cycle is taken up by people crossing and no time left for cars to make their turn.

"We lived in Seattle without a car and with children for 10 years.  People always seemed very impressed with this, but really it was not hard at all.  It is even less hard now since there are even more supporting transportation options.  

When our kids were tiny, we primarily relied on walking and the bus for most transportation --to work, to preschool and daycare, to the store, to the park and other entertainment.  We used Zipcar for doctor's appointments and the occasional trip to visit friends in inconvenient neighborhoods and trips to malls or out of the city.  We also rented cars when we were leaving town or when we had a lot of in city traveling to do for several days in a row (say at Christmas when relatives were in town).

Now things are even easier.  There are more options for grocery delivery - Amazon Fresh and Instacart, and Car2Go is great, particularly when you are at work without a car and need to suddenly fetch a kid who has gotten sick at school.  I haven't tried Uber, but I suppose that would also fill a gap - we used to use taxis occasionally too with the kids.

I'm honestly a little sad that we finally buckled and bought a car.  Ultimately, it was something of an impulse purchase because we could easily afford to purchase a car in cash.  Not owning a car for years and years definitely fed into our ultimate cash positive situation.  And while owning a car has made things easier in that we no longer have to plan ahead, it has been bad overall for our general health (we walk much less) and it is, I think, a bad thing for the neighborhood to put another car on the street.

The flip side to all this is that in order to live comfortably without a car, you are probably looking at moving to a more expensive neighborhood.  We lived in the International District with a baby and then moved to Wallingford.  Wallingford is pricey, but we got a relatively inexpensive house by initially buying a house on a busy arterial.  The house had no on street parking and was across the street from a mini-mart.  These would be drawbacks for other people but were not for us -- I think of it as receiving a ""pedestrian's discount"".  I'd highly recommend looking for a similar situation whether you are buying or renting.

If you end up buying a house, it can be tough paying extra for a house in a popular walkable neighborhood, but better that the money go into the house than a car.  In the end, a house in such a neighborhood will appreciate well. The car will just suck money out of your life.

When we were considering purchasing a house, we thoroughly tested out the house we were interested in by walking from it to whatever amenities we thought we would need in the neighborhood and by trying out the commute by bus to work and elsewhere.  I think this is essential to make sure you are finding a location that you can really live with.

Good luck with your investigation.  Don't let anyone who hasn't done it tell you that you can't live without a car in Seattle when you have kids.  I think it is a fantastic idea.  It will be great for you, great for wherever you choose to live and great for your kids. Our kids have already told us that when they grow up they are not going to have cars.

2. This has nothing at all to do with methane production. Nothing.  This is about diverting solid waste from the landfill in Oregon.

3. Paper notices is your complaint?  I really should just stop here but...

4. How is this different than current solid waste pickup schedules?  The only fucking difference is the bin it goes into.  There are no additional trucks, new bins, new waste, or anything.  I really should have stopped before but...

5. Your concern is that you live in a quadplex and don't trust your neighbors?  Is that what this really comes down to?  Since you're the one spending hours railing against this on reddit, which of those four is most likely to ignore the law?

6. This is conspiracy level potato derp.

"Well, just like the NY police union figures heavily in NYC's story now, so too does the Seattle police union (SPOG) heavily influence Seattle's problems with police accountability. Both are very strong unions but Seattle's union is particularly powerful for a number of reasons that go well beyond the typical influence gain through political clout (all politicians want a police union endorsement and don't want to be accused of being weak on crime by cops, after all).
  
First, the state of Washington has a governmental agency that tends to heavily weigh in on the union's side whenever disputes occur, and when decisions get made as a result of union complaints against the city, those become precedents. 
  
This is important in that the city itself gave it tremendous influence over the disciplinary process long ago when the city government included disciplinary process as a bargaining chip during contract negotiations. Once they did that, in order to save money on officer salaries, it became a precedent, thus now all proposed changes to the disciplinary process must be approved by the union during contract negotiations.  
  
So, you have a union, who's job it is to defend officers accused of misconduct, that has veto power over any proposed change to that process. So, for example, when Seattle wanted to make dishonesty an offense that results in termination, the union said, ""if you give us a big enough pay raise, you can do that... but you have to prove that the officer intentionally lied."" The city agreed, changed the discipline, then found out how impossible it is to prove intent, resulting in an ineffective disciplinary change that they paid heavily for... so there isn't much to be gained politically by opposing the union's wishes.   
  
Beyond that, we also see both unions reacting with de-policing, which is aimed at increasing crime rates. This is also a means used to influence the political process when they blame the crime increase on disciplinary changes or politicians that oppose them, thus pushing public opinion against whatever change they didn't like... which basically makes it political suicide to oppose the police union, at least when dealing with a strong and savvy union like the SPOG.  
  
tl,dr: Since the union prevents changes to the disciplinary process and their opponents would commit political suicide by doing so, politicians have no incentive to oppose the union and every incentive to support them.

"&gt; It is RIDICULOUS.

How so?  I've ranted this before and I'll rant it again: This is *exactly* what we, as a society, have decided that we want.  People with money get to have things that people who lack money don't get to have.  If I wave more money in front of your landlord, I get your apartment at the end of your lease.  If you wave more money in front of the seller of a house, you get the house instead of me.  The people who got there first--the owners of properties that are zoned single-family, the people living in neighborhoods who campaign against upzones--get that money and either put it into more expensive housing here or depart.

We're building a light rail station in the Roosevelt neighborhood and that area will have no taller height limitation than the proposed rezone of 23rd Ave in the Central District.  What interest do any of the current owners or current landlords have to change the situation?

"Purely anecdotal...

I work in the timber industry and have toured a few fencing mills that cut both cedar and treated white wood. I'm not a carpenter or lumber grader, but from what the old-timers tell me, today's 2nd-growth red cedar does not contain the same amount of oils and tannins that repel insects and rot that the old-growth wood did. They didn't have time to build up. It also causes the quick graying. 

I scale cedar regularly and a lot of the loads are 50-90 small (5-8"" top diameter) logs. The lack of oils that the old guys talk about makes sense to me because these loads don't have that strong smell that older wood does (like shake and shingle bolts). The ring count is sometimes course and won't hold a nail as well either.

That said, the cedar fencing is going to be much more expensive because it's still a superior wood and rarer. The delivered price where I'm at was something like $1400 for a thousand board feet. I haven't been to the hardware store in a while, but I imagine the finished product is far higher.

It was unbelievably infuriating. So I circumvented the exchange for the last 4 months of the year and paid Premera directly... that mostly solved the problem. I say mostly because I had another hiccup where the exchange canceled my insurance (without my authorization) because they were not getting the money. That was resolved quickly when I had someone from Premera call them for me directly.

Steps to correct:

1) Legalize prostitution but require prostitutes to have a license that they have to renew yearly. Keep this information private but available to law enforcement / regulatory bodies. Part of the licensing process should be giving the prostitute information on how to leave the business if so desired.

2) AGGRESSIVELY prosecute pimps, john and unlicensed prostitutes in that order. Make it financially unfeasible to operate without a license. Severe jail time for pimps. 5k fines or what have you for johns / unlicensed prostitutes.

Pardon?  I wonder if he even reads the document he swore to uphold.  Article 7, Section 1 (""Taxation"") of the Washington State Constitution:

&gt; All taxes shall be uniform upon the same class of property within the territorial limits of the authority levying the tax and shall be levied and collected for public purposes only.

Nothing in there about the property tax being intended for education.  Article 9, concerning education, does not even mention a property tax.

Regardless of the minutiae of his statement, Sen. King is incorrect even about the practical use of the property tax these days.  The property tax pays for improvements and services that benefit or serve a property directly or the region in which it sits, like education and infrastructure.  Light rail--and public transit in general--is an excellent candidate for funding via property tax because it increases the value of the surrounding properties and makes an area more desirable.",false,false,t1_co2xgj3,somenewuser,The CD,0,1422402599,t5_2qhad,t3_2tvxsd,t3_2tvxsd,15,1424354913,0,0,co2xgj3,Seattle,15,,flair

"I'm prepared to be downvoted, but this thread reveals exactly the problems MLK Jr. pointed out with ""white moderates"" opposing the path to civil rights because it inconvenienced them.

**A lesson to /r/seattle from Martin Luther King, Jr.**

In his [Letter from a Birmingham Jail](http://www.africa.upenn.edu/Articles_Gen/Letter_Birmingham.html), MLK Jr. stated that the ""white moderate"" who is more concerned with ""order"" than justice, *was the greatest obstacle to achieving racial justice.* 

The ""white moderate"" who opposes civil rights and social justice in favor of order and convenience:
&gt; the white moderate, who is more devoted to ""order"" than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; **who constantly says: ""I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action"";** who paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for another man's freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for a ""more convenient season."" Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection.

So, *everyone who opposes protests because it inconveniences them* was labeled by Martin Luther King Jr. himself as one of the greatest obstacles to the path of civil rights and social justice. This thread and /r/seattle is exactly who MLK Jr. was talking about. How does that make you feel?

FHA and other government-backed loans are subsidized by federal taxpayers under a policy of encouraging home ownership.  They also have the effect of increasing sprawl because the programs include limits on borrowing to buy condominiums or townhouses but virtually no limits on buying single-family houses.

Because of the loan guarantee, the cost of buying a house is made cheaper because the cost of the funds to buy it is less expensive.  Therefore, the people who buy their Tudor-style-Rambler on the far fringe of the Growth Management Area and drive their cars to work on publicly-funded roads while burning gasoline supported by tax credits for drilling and exploration are directly subsidized by transit riders living in the urban city.

"Don't downvote /u/Ududude, his question is valid and one that many people have.

~~I will answer your question in a few, i'm heading out the door now :) I just thought I'd respond cause I'm upset with the downvotes.~~

Ok /u/Ududude, lets talk about what defines gender, vs what defines sex. If I were to show you a photo of Mariah Carey, you'd without a doubt tell me that you saw a female. The same applies if I were to show you a photo of the transgenderd Laverne Cox (Orange is the New Black).  But why did you see a female? Well I'll tell you it wasn't because you pulled down their pants to see what's between their legs. No, you grew up learning what a female is supposed to look like and what a male is supposed to look like, the gender social construct.

Gender is something that has been defined by our society, and we decide to follow those rules or not. This is the answer to your first question, why do you think you get to decide what qualifies as a woman (or man)? 

Now sex is a little different, sex is more or less the organs you posses at birth. You say, 

&gt;I don't think if I had my genitals removed it would make me any more of a woman. 

That's because it wouldn't. You identify as a man, you will always see yourself as a man with or without a penis. Now, going along with this idea, imagine you were born a woman, and this is the way you thought all the time. With or without a penis, you always saw yourself as a man. You act manly and play rough sports, but yet, society still expects you to act like a woman, this is what trans people feel like. You kinda answered this question yourself, I don't think if I had my genitals removed it would make me any more of a woman. I could say the same thing; Just because I have a penis between my legs, doesn't make me feel any more masculine. This is sex.

Finally, one could argue that feeling transgender is a psychological problem, one that is entirely fixable through a social transition. Having surgery to is merely a way to correct the thoughts on what you feel should be down there. In fact, many trans people do not even get surgery, and are still seen by society as women. Think of the surgery as the icing on the cake.

"Yes, single drivers will now be given the option to pay a toll and drive in the carpool lane. This was not previously an option for single drivers. You can read more about it [here](http://wsdotblog.blogspot.com/2014/10/flashing-lights-signal-start-of-i-405.html).

Some helpful information:

&gt;Currently, the HOV lanes are full during peak periods along I-405 and do not provide a reliable trip for transit and vanpools. 

&gt;One of the primary objectives of the express toll lanes is to improve traffic performance. Our traffic models predict that keeping a two-person carpool requirement will not allow us to meet our state and federal mandate of 45 miles per hour, 90 percent of the time during peak periods. Still, if we simply changed the carpool definition to 3+ without express toll lanes, the lanes would be underutilized. By building express toll lanes, we can fill those lanes back in by giving drivers the choice to use them. 

&gt;Research on existing express toll lane users in Washington and in other parts of the country reveals that people of all income levels choose to pay tolls when they need a faster trip, whether that be during regular daily commute, running late to an appointment, or picking up a child from school or day care. They don't use them every day, but they do use them when they need them.",false,false,t1_co51deo,whatever1001,Green Lake,0,1422567676,t5_2qhad,t3_2u4hi4,t3_2u4hi4,13,1424318789,0,0,co51deo,Seattle,13,,flair

Parents can be equally culpable in stifling a girl's interest in computers. It's anectdotal, but I have two female friends whose parents were very strong in enforcing gender stereotypes, and refused to even let my friends consider comp sci on college. So when I met them in college later and discussed what I loved about the field, they took an interest (one changed their major, the other was too far along in their original degree but is now looking for postgrad options to make a career out of it.). This was the first time in their lives that someone had this conversation with them.

"I agree with what you entirely, I just want to clarify that Mr. Wingate never pled guilty. He entered into a dispositional continuance for his case: in his dispo, as long as he didn't have any new criminal law violations for the next 2yrs, the charges would be dismissed. If he did pick up a new criminal law violation, according to the dispo, the judge would just look at the police report, which stated he was threatening w/ a golf club, and determine his guilt. He would certainly be found guilty. From a criminal defense perspective, with someone w/ no criminal history and at his age, a dispo is a great outcome because he is likely to be successful. Obviously a dismissal is better, but thats up to the prosecutor or in a limited sense the judge. A public defender is going to advise a client like Mr. Wingate to take the dispo every time. But see below, the problem was timing.


Looking at the public records, a few more amazing/staggering/outrageous things:

1. He entered the dispositional continuance THE DAY AFTER being arrested. That is alarmingly fast. I know from personal experience it takes weeks for Seattle PD to process in-car video for criminal cases. I can absolutely guarantee that neither the City Attorney (the prosecutor) nor the public defender had seen the video. At that point they only had the police report of what happened and Mr. Wingate's word. But the City and Judge don't care what the defendant says happened.

2. A Rule 9 intern signed the dispositional continuance. Rule 9s are law students that don't have a license to practice law. A supervising public defender also signed it, but its not difficult to imagine a scenario where Mr. Wingate was being advised by a law student. 

3. IMHO, what is exceptional in this case is that the injustice was corrected and Mr. Wingate eventually had his case dismissed. ",false,false,t1_co41jd4,Extension_,,0,1422486999,t5_2qhad,t3_2tzgrm,t1_co3ruws,46,1424335882,0,0,co41jd4,Seattle,46,,

I hardly have a problem with stock exhausts, even when people are riding like jackasses. Stock cruisers are on the loud side, but even under high revs they are still below the threshold for hearing damage. The worst are the modded cruisers and the crazy modded cafe racer trend. They just don't give a fuck about anybody but themselves. 

As a former rider (2001 Speed Triple), I used to be more sympathetic to the appeals of motorcyclists.

"I'm commenting on the top post because I want a contrasting opinion to be seen and not shoved to the bottom. A guy is walking down the street with a golf club in an area where it did not make sense to have a golf club. A police officer notices the guy and his unusual behavior. It is unusual, I've never seen a dude using a golf club as a cane before. She pulls over and asks him to put the club down. Eliminate the potential hazard, then figure out the explanation. Instead the guy becomes agitated and does not comply when asked repeatedly. People are coming up next to him and they don't know what is going on, and for all the officer knows this man could be completely batshit. He could be drunk and belligerent, he could be mentally ill, he have come with the club with the intent on harming a person or property. The man was carrying around a golf club, it's not normal and potentially dangerous. We don't know if she actually saw him swing the club, it's not in the video. Regardless, she has asked him multiple times and people are starting to crowd around. Things could potentially escalate at any moment and this guy refuses to put down what could very easily hurt someone around him if he becomes too agitated. At this point, it is perfectly reasonable to take him into custody for obstruction and figure out what the hell is going on. You wouldn't carry around a baseball bat and no baseball and argue with a police officer when they told you to put it down. A reasonable person would put it down, then explain the situation. Had his man done the same, everyone would have gone home happy. This had absolutely nothing to do with the fact that the man was black, and it makes me sick that someone titled the article the way they did. Journalism is supposed to be unbiased. You present the facts and you allow readers to determine their own conclusions. Somewhere we lost that and journalism became about who could get the most hype, and present stories in a way which grabbed readers and viewers. This was never about the man being black, that is just what gets the most attention. When people are paying attention, money is made. Your clicks to a website, your viewership of a news program, your copies of a paper are only about making money for the journalists. They don't care about integrity anymore. Police hate, and the victimization of the African American population is a hot commodity right now. These stories make the most money, and get the most attention. I wish that people would stop buying into this sensationalist bullshit and think for themselves. Stories like this undermine the attention that should be placed on real racism.

"I think most dissenters are missing the point of lane splitting; it's not some adrenaline fueled thing that is done recklessly, or a way to ""cut in line"", but has many advantages for both biker and the motorists in cars.

* First; biker safety. The studies have been linked time and time again here, and personal anecdotes shared, so I won't get into it again. Bottom line; it's MUCH safer to filter/split in heavy traffic situations for motorcyclists.

* Second; congestion. Filtering/splitting allows for the maximum use of the paved surface area of the road; it's much more efficient especially in crowded urban areas where traffic and congestion are mostly an issue. Filtering essentially removes motorcycles and their people from the road as far as cars are concerned. There aren't motorcycles taking up space that a car could be taking up. This directly translates into less traffic, and EVERYONE, both driver and biker alike, getting to their destination faster. This effect has been studied many times, but this [Belgian Traffic Study](http://www.tmleuven.com/project/motorcyclesandcommuting/20110921_Motorfietsen_eindrapport_Eng.pdf) does the best and most thorough job of explaining it. You can't bitch about bad traffic and then fight against laws meant to ease said traffic.

* Third; emissions. Motorcycles put out much less harmful emissions into the air than cars do; this is easily agreed upon. Combine this though with #2 above and everyone, cars and bikes, are spending less time on the road burning fuel. In a region as ""green"" as Washington likes to tout, this is a no-brainer.

* Fourth; incentive! Want to get to where you're going faster and not sit in traffic? Ride a motorcycle: traffic is for cars! While maybe not a direct incentive to make the switch, lane filtering/splitting will perhaps show more people that motorcycling is an efficient and fast (not to mention cheap!) mode of transportation around town, especially in urban environments. With more bikes on the road, the traffic will definitely improve (see linked study above for more discussion on this). Did I mention it's cheaper? Quicker? More fun?


Yes, there will be some adjustment for drivers if this bill is passed, but really it's not hard. You get used to driving in other countries where filtering/splitting is the norm in a matter of days. Fighting against it with the ""Now I need to look out for bikes!"" argument is fallacy and scary. As a motorist, you are already responsible for being aware of your surroundings and operating a vehicle in a safe manner. You should already be looking in your mirrors (twice!) before changing lanes. Bikes are pretty easy to spot; bright headlight that's always on and a bunch of reflective bits all over it. If you can't pay attention enough to do that and see us, please refrain from operating a vehicle for the safety of us all; biker and driver alike.

We here in the US associate riding a motorcycle as a hobby, unlike the rest of the world which treat it more as a means of affordable transportation. If you travel just about any place outside of North America, you have seen this. Our laws and attitudes towards bikers definitely reflect our view of bikes as a hobby. In this increasingly resource starved world, we need to change that attitude. This is a good step.

"Ok so I've watched this a few times from the beginning to the point they put him against the hood of the cruiser and the audio becomes inaudible, and [mapped out](http://i.imgur.com/gurq4Yh.png) the officer's path from the beginning of the video. At the start (0:03) she is heading east bound on E Pike, heading towards 11th where she makes a left turn (0:16). She then heads north to E Pine and makes a right (0:47), E towards 12th and makes another right (1:34), and then pulls up on the man at the northwest corner of 12th and E Pike where the incident begins (1:50).

At 2:35 she claims ""...you just swang that golf club at me...yes you did, right back there."" So she seems to be suggesting he did it before she rolled up on him, not during the argument from 1:50-2:35.

4:19. By this point the male officer has shown up on the scene, although you've only heard evidence of this on audio. The female officer comes around the car and at 4:19 says ""...it's about you swinging the golf club at me at 11 and Pike.

4:31 She backs it up again, saying ""You swang that golf club at me when I took the corner at 11 and Pike""

Her turn on the corner of 11 and Pike occurred between ~0:11 - ~0:20.

As far as I can tell, I don't even see the guy until 1:50. I didn't see him at the corner of 11 and Pike, though the video isn't high quality and only faces forwards.

By the only evidence we have, the man is completely in the right, as the video only ever shows him minding his own business. Her claim, even if it were true, is not corroborated by the video evidence. The thing that does seem strange is she never mentions or reports the swinging until long after she's started the altercation with the man. I have no idea what standard police protocols are, but if I was planning to approach a person who I believed had just swung a weapon at me, I think I'd report that to HQ before the encounter, right?

"Hence University Street downtown. 

History from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Washington#History :

&gt; In 1861, scouting began for an appropriate 10 acres (4 ha) site in Seattle to serve as the campus for a new university. Arthur and Mary Denny donated eight acres, and fellow pioneers Edward Lander and Charlie and Mary Terry donated two acres to the university[10] at a site on Denny's Knoll in downtown Seattle. This tract was bounded by 4th and 6th Avenues on the west and east and Union and Seneca Streets on the north and south.

&gt; (...)

&gt; The University relocated from downtown to the new campus in 1895, moving into the newly built Denny Hall. The regents tried and failed to sell the old campus, and eventually settled on leasing the area. The University still owns what is now called the Metropolitan Tract. In the heart of the city, it is among the most valuable pieces of real estate in Seattle and generates millions of US$ in revenue annually.

"&gt; Washington offers a level of social services to low-income households which is far greater

Evidence?

Washington's poor are [even worse off](http://www.seattlemet.com/news-and-profiles/publicola/articles/tax-report) than the poor in other states, due to our highly regressive and anti-poor tax schema. We're one of only two states that have seen [both](http://www.washington.edu/news/2014/09/18/poverty-income-inequality-increase-in-washington-state/) poverty and inequality increase in recent years.

Our increasing inequality in Seattle and Washington [is a direct result](http://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2024548711_taxreportxml.html) of the regressive tax system and influx of high-paid workers who pay no state income tax. 

As a result, we're also seeing declining growth of revenue to fund basic services. The over-reliance on sales tax has been shown to lead to [declining state tax revenues](http://www.king5.com/story/news/local/2014/09/15/washington-sales-tax-wealth-gap/15658825/) and [declining public funds](http://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2024548711_taxreportxml.html).

State lawmakers are facing a projected budget deficit for the next spending period of nearly $1 billion. In fact, WA's education is so underfunded that the legislature was [in contempt for violating the state constitution](http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2014/09/11/washington-high-court-holds-legislature-in-contempt-in-school-funding-case/).

Vancouver himself was in the British Navy during the war, but was with Captain Cook and otherwise doing exploring/surveying work.

In the 1830s there was an attempt to rename the Cascades ""President's Range"", and the main volcanos after US presidents. Mount Jefferson in Oregon had already been so named.

No more! There is a super easy, quick, non-messy way to extract all the seeds in just a few seconds. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyTRkUTtgic

1. Cut around the ""equator"" of the pomegranate with a small sharp knife. You're just going a couple millimeters into the skin.

3. Hold a pomegranate half upside down in the palm of your hand with the seeds facing down over a bowl.
4. Grab a wooden spoon or use the handle of your knife and start spanking the back of the pomegranate. The seeds will simply tumble out into the bowl and you should end up with practically nothing left in the hull of the fruit. 

No water to deal with, no peeling, no mess, you get to take your frustrations out on a poor piece of fruit and you can start shoveling those delicious seeds into your mouth.

"It simply is not the case that the welfare of animals and the quanity and quality of product produced always go hand in hand. Sure, physically abusing the animals in your care is also going to hurt your bottom line, but factory farms have clearly found that raising lots of animals in tightly packed conditions is a very successful way for them to make money. Similarly, [battery cages](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_cage) and [gestation crates](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestation_crate) have become regular tools in animal agriculture not because chickens packed six to a tight cage are happier than chickens that are free to roam in a field, but because farms can make more money at the expense of animal welfare by doing so.

&gt;Groups who go under cover at farms do so with an agenda. Perhaps they catch a ""bad apple"" abusing an animal. The right thing to do would be to report that person to a supervisor right away &amp; the situation would be resolved immediately. Instead, undercover video is recorded, maybe over a period of time, &amp; then it gets sat on &amp; finally released to maximize fundraising potential.

&gt;If other industries are able to dictate recording &amp; photography in their facilities, why should farming be any different?

Fraud and trespassing are already crimes that apply to all industries. This isn't a proposal to give farming the same rights that other industries have.

Imagine The Seattle Times wanted to do a story on the working conditions at Walmart in Washington State. They send one of their reporters to get hired at Walmart and the reporter records what is happening there. They find that Walmart management illegally requests that employees work overtime for no pay. They document this behavior not just at a single store, but at several stores, then turn this footage over to law enforcement to take appropriate action. 

If there was a similar ""Retail Gag"" law, the Seattle Times reporter would be charged both for obtaining the job under false pretenses, and for continuing to investigate the scope of the problem instead of immediately reporting the first incident before any case could be made.

If you really believed they were ever about being this small, non corporate brewery sticking it to the man, you're about as stupid as they come. I'm willing to bet that was their ""angle"" from day 1 for marketing, and you all bought it hook line and sinker.

Its no coincidence to me that a city notorious for its shunnery of anything perceived to be non local and its elitist, smug/snobbery when it comes to beer would birth a brewery who would exploit these known market traits for a successful marketing campaign that paints them as the underdog and last remaining holdout from corporate pressure.

The hilarious part is that so many of you *actually believed this* like doe eyed fools. That sense of betrayal is misplaced, you should all instead feel angry at yourselves for being taken in so easily by a businesses' marketing. A business never exists for a larger principle or to make an impact on its local community- it exists to make money for the owner until it can't anymore, and they will ride it out no matter where it goes until the money stops.

"I run political campaigns here.

In addition to the accurate analysis by /u/NPMSRP, these 3 reasons are why anti-police reform interests are so powerful:

* **The average Seattle voter is not concerned by the behavior of SPD officers.**

You have to consider who votes. The average primary voter in Seattle is over 60 years old and white. They are angered by property crime and afraid of becoming a victims of violent criminals. 

Local polling has repeatedly showed that the average voter will change their voting behavior if they feel that police aren't responding to crime fast enough or if they are afraid of becoming a victim of violent crime. They do not change their vote over police use of excessive force or civil rights violations. 

Every primary voter doesn't feel that way, but the average primary voter does. 


* **Anti-police reform interests (like SPOG and Seattle Police Foundation members) donate to campaigns much more than pro-reform interests**

Before districted seats, knocking out a city council incumbent took $150K-$250K+ and knocking out a mayoral incumbent took $500K+. Unless you're independently wealthy or a once-a-generation candidate or your opponent got busted for DUI or bribes, that kind of money requires institutional support. That money does not like things to change. 

Districted council seats (in effect for the first time this year) might help with this problem, but I'm not overly optimistic about that.

* **There are and/or have been people in SPD who work from within to undermine politicians they don't like.** 

I've witnessed it. That's all I'll say about that.

"**I completely disagree.**

&gt; Say what you will, but this is a pretty quick reaction by the mayor and chief. I think Murray learned his lesson about standing by SPD/taking their word about things after that whole thing with Holden and Bailey last year.

**O'Toole had a 7 month reaction time.** O'Toole saw her officer lie make an unjustified arrest. She reacted earlier this month with a meeting and an apology, and on Tuesday said she thought counseling was appropriate for Officer Whitlock. Counseling for an officer who lied and jailed a black man, after making very relevant racist facebook rants.

The **only** reason she's ordering a ""review"" (how much of a review does there really need to be - the facts have been established for months) is because of the public scrutiny.

&gt; I know the shitlords in this forum hate the Stranger (probably because they got Sawant elected), but who else is doing work like this?

The Stranger is evidently the only shot we have at exposing and fixing these problems. 

&gt; In a way, this is the way things are supposed to work. Media finds misconduct, highlights it, and government responds. Now if the ultimate result of this is that she gets more 'counseling,' I'll be disappointed.

No, not at all. **The government is supposed to do all they can to PREVENT misconduct**, and when they find it, they are supposed to address it. They completely failed to do that at every level. Why are we paying her 6 figures if the media has to do her job?

The SPD reviews their own videos. [This video was reviewed at least **8 TIMES** between July and December of last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/2tzgrm/seattle_police_jailed_elderly_man_for_walking_in/co4i8s2). When officers, and attorneys, and the Deputy Chief, **and the Chief** view a video and see that an officer lied, they are responsible for taking action. 

**Chief O'Toole was well aware of this months before Stranger's reporting.** She ignored it, and on Tuesday said Whitlock receiving [""counseling from her supervisor, a course of action that the department believes to be an appropriate resolution.""](http://spdblotter.seattle.gov/2015/01/27/spd-returns-mans-golf-club/)

**When an officer can lie, falsely arrest someone, make racist rants on facebook that are reported to the department, have video and picture evidence of everything reported to the department and viewed by Chief O'Toole and the only action the Chief thinks is appropriate is ""counseling from her supervisor"" (which doesn't go on the officer's record), how is she not ENCOURAGING this behavior?**

"I'm very surprised and disturbed by this proposed bill for several reasons:

* 1) E-cigs and vaporizers have been shown to use fewer ingredients, thus reducing health risk.
* 2) Several studies support e-cigs/vapes as an effective method to quit smoking and reduce nicotine dependence with some even claiming it is superior to the patch and gum.
* 3) A 95% tax on anything is just outrageous; a doubling of costs at every level seems like a way to shut down the market. Especially when...
* 4) The bill would also ban online sales of equipment and juices, greatly reducing buyers for Washington entrepreneurs and discouraging small business startups.  For example, Mt. Baker Vapor, the website with this post, is one of the largest US suppliers.

While I've never been a tobacco user myself, I have seen my boyfriend, a smoker of 15 years, completely quit using any non-vape products and reducing his nicotine content over the last 9 months.  I'm happy to say he smells a lot better!

"The problems with this are numerous:  

1.  pointless fine imposed by city is not enough to reclaim the cost spent on sending enforcers out to inspect trash.  

2.  premise of composting at industrial scale is weak and revolves around methane production- a gas which could be caught and reclaimed for energy.  The greenhouse gas output of printing paper notices, employing people to do the legwork, slowing down garbage trucks, upping capacity on yardwaste pickups, etc?  Ignore that, it's magic.  It's all about how we FEEL.  

3.  Wasteful use of paper to notify people that they've done the wrong thing is frivolous and hypocritical.  

4.  Commercial sized compost bins are foul.  In the summer when your apartment's 60 gal container of rotten meat hasn't been picked up?  Yuck.  Even on the BEST of days, this is disgusting.

5.  Living in multi-family housing, it'll only take one person to screw this up a week in order to get fined.  Since the fine is 50x as much, it'll get checked.  Then we'll all get to have guilt trips and continued fines.  We can dig through trash and point fingers like animals.  In a fourplex you're looking at a $50/wk increase in your garbage pickup costs.  So that's about a $50/mo guilt-trip you can expect to get.  Unless you live in perfect harmony and ALL of your neighbors would never think of doing something like through rotten food into their dumpster because the compost dumpster was full, or they were drunk, or the lid stuck open, or they forgot, or their friend was in town, or a bum walked by, etc etc etc.  

6.  Allowing the city government to excuse away a law by claiming that they ""don't expect to enforce it much"" is just ridiculous- and a great way to encourage abuse.  Piss off your garbage man this week?  You'd better accept a fine next week.  Submit a FOIA request to see what purchases were made to support the additional work of this law?  ""Well the garbage man is just doing his job""...a little better on YOU than on everybody else...  My point is- plan to enforce your laws or don't have them.  Anything else is a threat.

All for what sounds like a wasteful, pointless exercise in environmental one-upsmanship.  Did SFC just enact one of these?  Did we feel the need to compete with some city?

"I emailed SPU when I got my infographic with some questions.  Here's what they said:


&gt;Hello swolebird,


Thank you for your questions. I understand how the new food waste requirement might raise some questions. Here are some answers to your questions.

*The garbage hauler will open the top of the cart before they put it into the truck and do a quick visual inspection of the contents. They will be looking for prohibited recycling materials and food/ yard waste.* **They will not open garbage bags.** *Too much will be if there is 10% or more of the can contents that are prohibited from the garbage.*

I hope I answered your questions. Please write me again with any further questions you may have.

Thank You,

Evelyn the Envelope

- Who is the judge of what is too much food or garbage?

- What are the exact limits on what is ""too much""? Is it determined by weight, volume, count, etc?

- If all the refuse coming from my house is in garbage bags and placed in the garbage can, will someone be opening my garbage bags to inspect the contents for ""too much"" food or recyclables?

But, based on my experiences on the road and the giant threads we have on /r/seattle any time someone breathes the word ""bicycle,"" negative opinions about cyclists usually seem to fall in one of these two categories:

1. ""That cyclist did something stupid, so cyclists suck."" While I hate the generalizations that often come with this type of opinion, they're usually the result of a cyclist genuinely doing something stupid or dangerous. There are a lot of people on bikes that do stupid shit, like running stop signs, red lights, cutting off cars, or any number of things. The rest of us law abiding cyclists don't like those behaviors either because in addition to being dangerous, it just stirs up animosity toward cyclists.

2. ""Cyclists should get out of my way!"" Occasionally drivers/commenters seem to think that just because cars can physically go faster, they have the $DEITY-given right to do so and cyclists should get out of their way. This is not a valid opinion and you should ignore these people. *Never* sacrifice your own personal safety just because a driver wants to make it to the next red light 15 seconds earlier. You have every right to use the roads we [all](http://www.seattlepi.com/local/opinion/article/Cyclists-ride-on-roads-their-taxes-pay-for-1249681.php) pay [taxes](http://www.seattlemet.com/news-and-profiles/publicola/articles/we-all-pay-for-the-roads) for and to get to your destination alive, same as any driver. If a driver is going to get offended or upset that you won't put yourself in a vulnerable situation for their own personal convenience, they're not someone who's going to respond to sane reasoning anyway.

&gt; But basically ""Just think like you're in a slow car"" is where I'll take my thinking from now on. That applies to a lot of questions I have around lane switching and signaling. 

Yes, this is a very good mindset.

"First off, bicycle lanes are technically part of the road. 

Secondly, cyclists are not required too ride in bicycle lanes. 

Thirdly, it is amazing how many drivers ignore those bicycle lanes. There are very often drivers in those lanes, whether they are turning, or just hanging over. Even when there are dedicated cycle lanes, with dedicated traffic lights, cyclists are often put in danger by ignorant or inattentive drivers.

"Yeah, that's the point:  there's not a fair dollar amount.  It's not fair for Bill Gates to pay the exact amount in state taxes as the homeless day laborer living in his truck.  After all, Bill Gates is benefitting from state services far more than the day laborer, so he should pay more.  E.g., Bill gets a certain percentage of his income from each and every Microsoft employee using the public roads to get in and out of Redmond every day, so he should pay more to fix those roads.  
  
If you're arguing that progressive taxation is unfair because it's based on percentages rather than flat amounts, you'd be considered too conservative for 1915, let alone 2015.  
  
**EDIT:** Regarding your edit: an upper limit on ""fair share"" is only possible if there's also an upper limit on total income.  Since there's not, nor should there be, a limit on how much money a person can make, then there's no limit on how much they can pay in taxes.  Again, this is the whole point.  We shouldn't have poor people paying more than their fair share, which is what would happen if you placed an upper limit on this.

"Sure!

Measure 1-2 tablespoons of clear vanilla extract into a liquid measuring cup, then fill with warm water to a bit below 3/4 cups. Pour over 5 tablespoons of meringue powder in a mixer bowl and beat with a whisk about 30 seconds until frothy. (If it's humid, add a large pinch of cream of tartar and whisk again - it helps the icing harden)

Dump in 2 lbs of powdered sugar all at once. If using a stand mixer, mix with the paddle attachment on the lowest speed for 10 minutes; if using a hand mixer, mix on medium speed for 10 minutes. (Stop after a few minutes to scrape down any sugar that sticks to the side of the bowl)

Transfer to a clean container and store at room temp, or just cover the bowl with a damp dishtowel and a plate if you'll be working directly from it. This makes very thick royal icing, which I then color and thin out in batches as I need it.

edit: Forgot to mention, I've found the biggest culprit for non-hardening icing is traces of grease on my equipment.

"I really enjoy the photography that‚Äôs posted here, even the stuff that gets downvoted. So last year I began a little project of saving my favorite photos. 

I had a couple of rules for myself: The photos had to be posted to reddit, I needed to make sure to credit the original photographer/poster (and not remove any watermarks that may be on them), and they had to be of Seattle. No photos of hiking in the mountains or beautiful shots of Bothel or things from Eastern Washington or all the other photos that get posted in the sub. My original rule was only photos taken within the city limits, but there were a few I just couldn‚Äôt pass up that fell just outside of those boundaries. 

Not every photo is an award-winner. Most are pretty amateur, in fact. A lot of them were downvoted or only had a handful of upvotes. But to me, they were all beautiful in a way: Some highlight events that happened, others focus on capturing a moment in time, others are iconic and breathtaking photography. A couple I came across were posted in other subreddits entirely. 

I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve seen a lot of these, but my hope is that many of them are new to you. Let‚Äôs take a stroll through the year that was 2014 in Seattle‚Ä¶

"Nope, they're being more strategic than that. And it's pretty smart.

That line about the project losing the support of the council is there to get the council to either refute or confirm it. 

One of three things happens:


1. They get the council to refute that statement, putting them on record as supporting a boondoggle (whether or not you agree, that's how they will portray it) even after all these problems

2. They get the council to agree (a long shot), leaving no real opponents to cancelation. 

3. The council says nothing concrete to confirm or refute and they get to repeat that as fact and use quotes from the recent contentious council meetings.

In other words, this is a very clever trap. 

Option 1 gives the GOP the ability to look like the only responsible adults in the room and paints the council (and in sure they'll extend that to include all dems/liberals) as irresponsible and bedding adult supervision. Options 2 and 3 cancels the viaduct, or paints legislative dems as fighting for a boondoggle that Seattle doesn't even want anymore. 

The council and legislative Dems made this possible with poor decision making, poor oversight, and/or trusting WashDOT too much. The Republicans are now going to make them pay for that.

**Will update recap when full video is released.** I was only able to get it to load until what I assume was the last half. Last year she spoke for about seven minutes. It targeted many of Obama's points, and included brief tangents to advocate for broader political opinions. Also, she only mentioned the $15 minimum wage once, from what I saw. The points that I was able to catch:

**On Obama's rhetoric on combatting climate change:**

* Obama has taken donations from and done absolutely nothing to address the major fossil fuel corporations' unwielded influence in policymaking 

* Addressing climate change means creating policy centered around the population and not moneyed interests 

* Obama has bragged about being the ""fracking president"" (with his ""All of the Above"" fossil fuel policy platform) 

* Here in Seattle, citizens have worked towards preventing oil and coal trains from passing through our city at the risk of our residents

**On racial politics and inequality:** 

* Every 28 hours a black person is killed by police or ""stand your ground"" vigilantes in this country - we live in an age of unaccountable violence against black people by government authorities 

* Inequality has grown across racial lines, in our age of economic racism. Black individuals make an average of 1/3rd the income of white individuals 

* Obama has provided no vision to address increasing racial economic inequality, increasing inequality of opportunities for people of color, and the continued mass incarceration and violence by authorities against communities of color 

* We need to advocate for an end to gendered and racial opportunity and income gaps 

* People of color are despondent after being ignored by *both* parties 

**On domestic security:**

* Let's not forget: Obama has overseen unprecedented constitutional violations against the american public through the NSA and spying 

* Obama has encouraged an unprecedented crackdown on whistleblowers and freedom of information 


And finally:

* We must work to build *independent* local movements advocating for all people's needs - especially the underrepresented. We must support policies forwarding a society based on economic justice, equal rights, compassion, and an end to all forms of racism.

"I live on a 34' sailboat (1994 Hunter 33.5) at Shilshole marina with my wife and two cats.  A boat in this age and class can be had for $25-60k.  Financing a boat of this class is generally on a 5-15 year loan basis - it's somewhere between a car and a house.  My payment works out to less than $500/mo.  Moorage is about $400/mo and includes water.  Power is metered and runs me about $100/mo.  Insurance is maybe $50/mo, and Shilsholes' liveaboard fee is ~$50 (I think, it just gets paid as part of moorage).  That works out to about $1100/mo in expenses - about half of which goes towards equity and theoretically will return (at some loss, boats don't really appreciate) over time.  This makes it quite economical to liveaboard.

There are a few important things to know:

Heat: Boats are connected to the water (duh), which means they are terribly inefficient to heat.  Most of my monthly electric usage is our two electric space heaters.  However, the water never falls below 53 degrees F, which means you only have to heat from 53 up, and the boat will never freeze (while in water that isn't frozen).

Space: A 34 foot boat works out to maybe 400sq feet of usable space.  But it's not a big square like an apartment studio - it's in nooks and crannies.  If you are a prolific organizer, you'll do well.
Here's a picture of the interior of the same model of boat (not mine).  Under each cushion, and behind each cushion, are several storage lockers.  If you look closely, you'll start to see how many different storage spaces there are.  You have to have the self discipline to use them, or you will easily fill the rest of the space with stuff - when that happens, the boat is uncomfortable and also useless as a boat (can't take out a boat if stuff is all over)
http://photos.mostsailboats.org/1992/h/1992-Hunter-33.5_26827_5.jpg

Power: My boat has a single 20a 120v circuit dedicated to regular loads.  A second 20a is used to run the battery charger which also powers all the 12v loads (because most of the stuff on a boat is 12v DC - lights, radio, water pump, etc).

Water: My boat has a small water heater and hot water tank good for a roughly 8 minute shower - less if you like scalding.  The dock water is just a garden hose type setup - we fill our water tank daily (after discovering quickly how much it sucks to run out of water in the middle of a shower).  There are shore facilities for showering and laundry that are more manageable, but they cost money.

Food: Most small sailboats have a coldbox that you put ice into.  For long term use, this is impractical - you'll either buy a 12v minifridge (we did, until we can save up for the next option) or you'll install a marine refrigeration unit into the coldbox.  In either case, a boat is generally more humid than living on land, so some food spoils more readily.  The kitchen is also quite small, but I enjoy the challenge.  On the upside, you usually get a gas range (propane) - good luck finding an apartment with one!

Education: Taking the boat out requires practice and education.  Having said that, it is one of the most enjoyable and rewarding experiences (for me).

Waste: We have our black-water (human waste) tank pumped every few weeks.  Costs ~$25, pretty hassle free.

Maintenance: Boats are a gigantic hobby project.  If you are a tinkerer, a mechanic, an aspiring electrician, or just handy, you'll do well.  If you're afraid of doing your own oil changes on your car, a boat is probably a bad plan - or you'll be hiring a mechanic (expensive).

Community: The boating community is incredibly social, supportive, and active.  There are a lot of liveaboards in the area.

There's a lot to say about living on a boat.  My wife and I absolutely love it.  I've tried to cover all the basics, but if you have any questions, I'd be happy to share what I've learned the hard way.  :)

I'll close with a bunch of my personal photos from living on a boat.

"The tacit backdrop for this article is that men deny women these sweet programming gigs.

Admittedly most CS programs and programming companies are male-dominated, and this no doubt turns some women away from the industry. That's bad. However, the overwhelming reason why there are relatively few women in programming is because, in general, as a group, women do not give a shit about programming. If you say you are a programmer, the typical male response is something like ""You must do some cool things. I feel an envy pang. Carry on, sir."" I may as well tell the average female that I fix toasters. They find it slightly marvellous and pitiful that someone should choose to do so.

Girls are move verbal than boys. Women are more social than men. Grade school teachers and social worker are overwhelmingly women. Women are better educated in general. When they do go into science they are more likely to choose life sciences. They are not so much forced out of engineering disciplines as not interested in sitting quietly at a desk, looking at numbers, for hour after hour.

No one gave Stallman, Bill Joy, Torvalds, Carmack, &amp;etc permission to program. The same is true for Ada Lovelace. Women who have got it, and decide to do it, can write their own ticket.

And actually, Paul, multiple redditors did address the bigotry accusations by essentially pointing out how *crystal clear* it is that the real issue is *gentrification*-- you know, the thing everyone normally says is the issue and which is widely understood to be the issue. Asserting that it has anything to do with bigotry on the basis that gentrification somehow results in bigotry seems kind of specious. In fact, it kind of seems like maybe an attempt to deflect from your own insanely prejudiced horse shit. (Speaking of which, I like how we're pretending Capitol Hill isn't one of the most expensive neighborhoods in Seattle.) Is it a campaign against *bros* or is it a campaign against *hate*? Or is it a completely brazen-as-fuck attempt to conflate the two by a bunch of NIMBYs?

I get it that people want the neighborhood to keep its character, but believe it or not, whether something is hipster enough for you is *not* actually a civil rights issue.

Along the same lines:

Say, you wouldn't be saying all this shit about tech workers just because Amazon opened a new campus and it allows you to pretend this is a new issue, would you? Because just for the record, a bunch of people who go on about *intersectionality* bitching that tech workers don't fit in-- pretty hilarious when you take a gander at the growing Indian and Asian populations in the area. You know, because it's just beer pong and madden 24/7 at Amazon. All the bRoGrammers get together in their utilikilts and fedoras so they can discuss the latest pickup artist techniques while watching the MLP Seahawks preshow before heading out for an all nighter of beating up gay people to steal their iphones. You know the stereotype, right? 

Having said all that, I get why the people who live on Capitol Hill don't want it to change, and I think if they want to apply market pressure on landlords by scaring away renters, that's whatever. It is, however, irritating that a community will attempt to *chase out all the heterosexuals* while proclaiming it's *everyone else* who is being a snob.

"Yay! I'm going to jump into an argument with a person who is willfully blind, only to get an equally blind and possibly offensive response that I will then ignore! Reddit, FTW!

A person who makes $1M a year most certainly uses more services than someone who makes $20K. They are likely ""job creators,"" are they not? So then, they are benefiting from state in that they have an educated workforce... they are benefiting from the state in that their educated workforce has a means by which they can get to work making money for Mr. $1M. They are benefiting from the state in that the police force and fire brigades are protecting their vast sums of wealth (and one could argue that they do it more vehemently than they do for Mr. $20K).

Basically, without the structure of the State, Mr. $1M has almost no chance of actually creating that much wealth. Is he capable of manufacturing all the goods or providing all the services he sells without a massive collection of infrastructure? An infrastructure regulated and controlled by the State? 

Without the benefits of taxation and public spending, Mr. $1M would have to build out and maintain all his own roads. Not just so that his employees can get to and from work, mind you, but also so that his goods and services can be distributed to other places. Does Mr. $1M have the means to create something on the scale of the Interstate system that was build by public funds in the US? Does he have the means to not only create international shipping systems, but also the means to protect them?

Unless Mr. $1M is so amazingly fantastic that he is worth $1M just by simply existing (and if you think that's actually possible, there's never going to be a point in talking to you because there's no reasoning with stupid), he requires an exponentially larger sum of publicly funded services in order to generate his wealth.

&gt; Why should a rich person have to carry the weight of everyone else simply because he is good at what he does and makes more from it?

Because without everyone else, the rich person cannot be rich. Plain and simple.

Also, since there's a good chance it might come up in my arguments about personally building and maintaining infrastructure...

Sure, someone like Henry Flagler made huge railroads and profited greatly by them. But there's also a reason that people like these were called robber barons. It's because they did it through questionable means and they destroyed a lot of people in doing it. 

Lastly, if you need a good visual as to ""why government, why taxes, why 'wealth redistribution'?"", just consider what happens when you put all the fat people on one end of a long canoe; you capsize and everyone drowns. On behalf of all the rest of the world (who weren't born at the right place in the right time to the right family with the right friends and the best opportunity for an education and proper networking)... people who think they have every right to life, liberty, and happiness as the wealthy... I'd like to say fuck those who think the rich should have an unlimited hand in gaining from and fleecing the rest. They are not more human than I, therefore they are not more deserving either.

The stock market is not a casino... sure you can lose money, but the difference is the odds are in your favor.

"I've driven motorcycles in traffic a lot in both Seattle and San Francisco. The only thing making lane splitting unsafe in California are the drivers who intentionally wish to cause motorcyclists harm. The ones who throw garbage out the window, stick their arms out at you, open their car doors or try swerving into your path when there is obviously no room for them to merge in the other lane.
 
Getting stuck in stop and go traffic in Seattle on a motorcycle is a really dangerous thing. The weather often makes it even more dangerous. Cars ride too close and don't stop well because they have no idea how to drive in the rain. Or they just plain don't see motorcycles. Add to that the cramping that can come from constantly adjusting a stiff clutch with your left hand to drive that slow and the physical strain adds to the exhaustion and stress of being in traffic in the first place.
 
The first time I rode my bike in California and came upon a freeway that was bumper to bumper for miles I had the usual near panic attack that I do when seeing that painful site in Seattle. Then I remembered I could lane split and chose to do so. It was like a gift from heaven. I found there was plenty of room between cars to carefully maneuver through at a safe pace. I got through the traffic like it wasn't even there. It felt like such a blessing!
 
The other argument for legalizing lane splitting is that it would reduce traffic. A bike takes up nearly the same space as a car does in traffic. If you let bikes get through traffic in between the lanes it allows more cars in the same space. It's more efficient. With more motorcycles in Seattle and lane splitting being legal I could see an overall reduction in traffic.",false,false,t1_cnwrioy,puerh_lover,Lynnwood,0,1421892651,t5_2qhad,t3_2t8h4b,t3_2t8h4b,80,1424474008,0,0,cnwrioy,Seattle,80,,flair

Answers to specific questions:

Q: Do cyclists ride up to the front of the line of cars? And do we stay on the left or the right?

A: You can, but be very careful. Often times cars aren't expecting a bike when they're at a red light and can suddenly decide they want change lanes to turn without doing a proper check. If you're not in a hurry, just stay behind the cars and wait like everyone else. Always stay on the right side of the road unless you're on a 1 way street... those will usually have arrow pointing what side of the street they want the bikes on.

Q: What if we're stopped in the right lane and a car wants to turn right?
A: Tough it out, if a car would block them it's ok for you to as well.

Q: When you're in traffic, are you in the right lane at all times? What if you want to turn left? Do you stay on the right-hand side or the left-hand side of the lane when you want to turn left?
A: Stay in the right lane unless  you intend on turning left... then obviously be in the left lane. Be sure to use your hand signals so cars know what you're trying to do. When you're turning left, stay where it's safe. You don't want a car to be trying to pass you on the left when you're trying to turn, so go ahead and sit in the middle of the lane.



Riding the bike on a road isn't much different than driving a car. You just have to be more careful because unlike people in cars you don't have a couple thousand pounds of metal and plastic to keep you safe. Don't get hung up on your ""rights"", ride safe.

"A capital gains tax causes people to invest less often or less than they would have preferred since it comes with increased cost per transaction.

Luxury taxes result in lost sales as people decide to just not purchase the things that are taxed this way and buy alternatives. For instance on luxury cars, more people will buy cars right below the threshold amount like you see in Canada, which potentially brings down overall sales revenue. It's why they have a ton of cars worth just under $50k and then the hundred people who own Ferraris.

Newly purchased home taxes create less liquidity as people decide not to buy as a often even though they might have otherwise. Thereby decreasing the ability of people to actually own or buy where they would like.

Taxes on rental properties force more people to sell instead of rent out their properties which decreases the supply of rentable housing for those that can't afford to own.

In your video the spraying which takes place in the video from this thread is at the 32 second mark, or there about. Also, the guy getting sprayed in the original video was on the correct side of the barricade. 

The guy in your video made the simple mistake of being there and not running away as soon as the cops showed up, this was supposed to be a march down that street if I understand it correctly. You can see that he gets hit by the spray without any apparent warning and is blinded, hence his attempts to move away while feeling out what is in that direction (I think the cop could have easily used verbal warnings to moved the target along and the cop doesn't appear to give the target any sort of physical warnings like holding up the can before firing).

"It's to try to keep the CEO instead of having them jump ship to the next job before everything's liquidated. The idea is that the costs of replacing a CEO and bringing a new CEO up to speed and the lost productivity during that ramp up time would be less than the pay increase over however much time they have left.

I'm not qualified to say whether it's the best way to approach this in a big picture sense, but that's usually the thinking at that board/cabinet leadership level.

Personally, I'd be really curious to see what upper leadership is doing in a situation like this. It's really hard to believe that they'd be adding enough value to the company to justify their own compensation. It's too easy to picture them wringing hands in their office and wasting time in meetings.

"I warned people that this was going to happen 2+ years ago as services were starting to get seriously cut and slashed.

If you really want to see how bad it's getting, tour downtown or the CBD or Cal Anderson Park well after 2 AM.

The streets around our major retail/commercial buildings are packed with people sleeping rough in sleeping bags and otherwise using fairly nice camping/outdoors gear.

Much of Seattle's population isn't the crusty oogie street kids or shambolic mentally ill, but people you would never know are homeless at first glance. There's a huge, huge invisible population of homeless people in Seattle who stay out of your way, don't pandhandle or trash the city.

Source: I'm currently homeless (but employed, heh) due to these service cuts combined with the massive rent hikes over the past few years.

Granted, I fled the city and was fortunate enough to have the skills, tools and will to try to take care of myself outdoors even during this fairly mild winter. Thankfully I actually like camping and biking and I can survive sub-zero temps outdoors with a combination of science, experience and decent camping.

If you want to consider or learn about the real root causes of homelessness, it's mainly a 50-50 mix of effective (mental) health care and financial opportunity and disadvantage. It's not just a bunch of street kids or drunks or addicts.

You should care about this because it's holding us back as a society. Among the homeless populations are real minds with valid contributions to make to society that are being wasted and destroyed by the stress and lack of care that homelessness brings.",false,false,t1_cnyxqp7,loquacious,,0,1422062958,t5_2qhad,t3_2tfyh1,t3_2tfyh1,28,1424427531,0,0,cnyxqp7,Seattle,28,,

"Totally. So there are couple things to consider:

1. New housing has always and will always be more expensive than old stuck, unless it is subsidized for lower income (which I totally support and think we need a lot more of). But by limiting how much new stock we can build we end up with situations where developers buy and remodel old stock and then sell it at similar new stock values. Condo conversions haven't quite come back to their pre-2008 levels, but it is an example of what happens when there just isn't enough supply for the demand. I'd advocate for allowing much higher buildings so that we can add a ton of units without having to tear down as many buildings.

2. The reason we have so much luxury stuff going up is that the demand for that kind of housing hasn't been satisfied. The big costs of development are the type of things that have to happen on any property (foundation, walls, utilities, etc.). What makes it luxury are the finishes (granite countertops instead of laminate). If a developer can only build X units and they know all of those can be luxury you better believe they are going to do that because it has the best profit margins. As supply meets demand they will move on to more market rate housing. Of course they will never voluntarily build affordable housing for low income people in the city. We have to force that to happen. I'm partial to mixed income developments that have a combination of luxury, market rate, and subsidized low income housing.

"NSFL story below - description of car-pedestrian collision below.  Proceed at your own risk.

When I was an EMT, I worked an accident in which a person leapt out in front of a car that was driving along a rural highway one night.  The driver of the car was taking his two daughters home from visiting their grandparents.  The girls were probably around 3 and 5. 

The jumper put himself in the median of a split four lane highway just over a rise.  Another driver coming the other way saw the accident and saw the jumper leap out into the traffic lane just before the car came over the rise and where the driver had little chance to avoid him. The suicide came partially through the windshield and his guts spilled out onto the driver's lap.  The dad knew that he had hit a person but at least told his girls that he had hit a deer.  (I overheard the older girl tell the other ambulance team that showed up that the deer was wearing underpants.)

We showed up after the other ambulance had already arrived.  The county coroner showed up shortly after and was trying to collect all of the parts.  We had to walk the median and the side of the road looking for the suicide's left foot.

Here was a guy driving his kids home on a cross-country trip.  He's in the middle of nowhere in the midwest with a totaled car and the nearest motel 15 miles away. The driver didn't seem like the kind of guy who had ample financial resources. The suicide could have killed him and his family through his selfish act and the image of it still bothers me.  I can't imagine how often the incident comes to him.  I just hope his kids don't remember it.

This was in rural NW Missouri.  The other ambulance crew in our district let the guy and his kids spend the rest of the night at our temporary crew quarters in their ambulance barn while he waited for a friend from home to come out and get him.  The accident happened at about 11:00 at night and by the time his friend was able to get there in the morning a few people in town had brought them breakfast and some food for the road.

"Okay, sure.

Let's say we're gonna shoot [this scene from *Wargames.*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Byn5PIZ0q4Q)  Here's what I need to get in the can:

 - crane shot of exterior, to establish

 - arcade interior, to establish

 - dolly shot over arcade out window, to establish

 - over-shoulder of Matthew Broderick playing Galaga

 - exterior of ""Snohomish High School""  to establish (pretty sure that's UW)

Not much, to be honest.  Obviously I'm going to need to lock down the arcade.  Obviously I'll need to have somewhere to put my [jib](http://www.porta-jib.com/vz-side.jpg) outside.  But here's the reality of the situation:  ""Permitting"" means ""renting a part of the city"" and it's a bigger piece than you think.  

Capturing these two minutes of footage involves:

 - The grip truck.  Probably a 10-ton.

 - The electrical truck.  Probably a 10-ton.

 - The camera truck.  Another 10-ton.

 - Wardrobe.  Another 10-ton.

 - Two star waggons (motor homes), 1 for Matthew Broderick, 1 for Ally Sheedy.  These aren't just vanity, these are where wardrobe and makeup do their thing.  If they're both starting their career, maybe they can share.

 - The production trailer (another RV).  This is where the logistics of the shoot take place.

 - Catering.  A food truck with possibly a van attached.

 - Sound.  Just a van, but still.

 - A 20-100kw generator.  We aren't going to do this on shore power because our lights will blow the breakers so we're running off diesel.

Already we need somewhere to put 5 trucks, 3 motorhomes, 2 vans and a couple cars.  They're going to sit there all day.  They need to be close enough to set that people can get in and out of them quickly but not so close that they aren't going to be in any shots.  But wait!  There's more!

 - Grip is gonna be 4 guys.

 - Electrical is gonna be 2-3.

 - Camera is gonna be 3 guys per camera plus the DP.

 - Wardrobe is gonna be 2.

 - makeup is gonna be 2-3.

 - Your stars are going to have 3 entourage ea.

 - The production trailer is gonna be the producer, the line producer, two PAs, the accountant, the location coordinator, the site rep and the set medic.

 - Catering will ride in the truck.  WIN!

 - Sound is gonna be the van plus two other guys.

 - Figure between 2 and 8 PAs to fill in and gopher in amongst all this.

And no, they don't carpool.  You can park them off-site and haul them in via pass van (add 3 more people) but you need 40 parking spaces.  Call it 50 because you'll have press stopping by and you'd rather have too much.  

We're shooting a nothing scene and already we've absorbed an entire mini-mart just in ancillaries.  If we actually wanted to shoot ""Snohomish High School"" that means a company move - we need to get every one of those people back in every one of their vehicles - *with all their shit* - and do this all over again somewhere else.  There's a reason ""Snohomish High School"" looks so much like UW.  

All this is manageable.  All this is routine.  All this can be accomplished without any real difficulty... assuming this is what you do for a living.  And if you wanted to shoot Wargames in New Mexico, you'd contact [the film commission](http://www.nmfilm.com) and they will hook you up.  Shit, you could be an absolute nobody and [search for ""arcade""](http://www.nmlocations.com/loc_results.aspx?search=arcade&amp;rgn=All%20Regions&amp;rgnid=&amp;cnty=All%20Counties&amp;cntyid=&amp;city=All%20Cities%20%2F%20Towns&amp;cityid=&amp;subcat=&amp;style=&amp;lname=&amp;lid=&amp;dist=&amp;zip=) and get an answer.

In Washington, [you call Steve.](http://www.seattle.gov/filmoffice/productionresources.htm)  Who also does music, by the way.  

New Mexico will connect you with businesses that are already interested in filming, that know what they need to be paid.  They will connect you with liasons that will get you the city offices, traffic cops, ancillary personnel and paper you need to film all day long without worrying about tourists in the shot.  

Washington gives you Steve.  He'll point you to the [faq.](http://www.seattle.gov/filmoffice/filmfaq.htm)  After all, he's part-time, I think.

Which means *you* need to figure out where to park 50 cars, 5 trucks, 3 motorhomes and 2 vans, above and beyond all the shit that's like, *your job.*

Look.  It's gotten better.  It used to be pure shit.  But we haven't even gotten into incentives, this is just ancillary bullshit.

I know a DIT.  That's the guy who manages the camera data.  He worked on (a huge movie) in Vancouver - the production would pay for him to go up, but wouldn't pay for his assistant.  My buddy said he'd pay for his assistant's room'n'board out of his fee 'cuz he wanted to work with someone he knew who knew what they were doing, rather than local crew.

""You don't understand,"" he was told.  ""We're making more in incentives for using a local assistant than we're spending *paying for you.*""

"Well I'll get buried, but I'm actually excited to be able to explain the inner workings of this stuff!

I'm a garbageman in Seattle (when I'm not injured, as I am now), and here's what's happening when you see this:

First, assume your garbage is what we refer to as ""contaminated"".  Your garbageman has been instructed by his manager to leave you this note and mark it in his route tracking software.  Assuming he doesn't do this and a city inspector (white Jeep Liberty with ""Seattle Public Utilities"" painted on the side) sees it.  That inspector will then call the garbageman's manager, who will write up the garbageman.

We work for the city government, not the individual customers.  If we fail to enforce a city policy, the city will factor that into our next contract bid, as well as in the bidding process for other cities.  Ultimately it will likely cost us the contract, costing millions of dollars and hundreds of jobs.  

As for Cleanscapes, we've been bought out by a company in California called Recology.  They do all the waste pick up for San Francisco, which has an extremely strict policy concerning food waste/recycling contamination.  We've got a bunch of experience marking cans as contaminated, this is just another parameter we're expected to abide by.",false,false,t1_cndczbv,CodeBlue_04,,0,1420315212,t5_2qhad,t3_2r5n08,t3_2r5n08,14,1425078373,0,0,cndczbv,Seattle,14,,

Do you like IT in the office, do you want to work on the network edge, do you want to work in the network core, how would you architect an 8 node national backhaul network, that stuff.  Have you read anything about the various pros and cons of network architecture, or have you any opinions on which layer 2/3 switch is superior and why?  


The point is you need to love what you do, if you don't do that, you are fooling yourself, and in a competitive market quite a few people doing the hiring can tell you are a go-nowhere loser right now.  It's probably fixable, hell, you at least took the step to ask the question.


Figure out what you're passionate about and start acting like it.  The jobs will happen.  It's a booming market, you're hardly too old, people well into their 40s are doing networking.  But if you aren't truly passionate about it forget it, because a half-ass attempt at  a CCNA screams ""fail"" more than your age does.

"I agree.  I do have to look at this from a race perspective because I too am a black man in Seattle.  I have never been arrested or had any issues with the law,  and I'm an active duty service member at Madigan. 

It bothers me that me,  or any of my family members could have easily been in a similar situation. The fact that our judicial system has become more concerned with getting the accused to plea for lesser chargers to a crime that was never committed is terrifying.  

Too often we find a story on the news of wrongly accused victims of the state,  and the system from the top down is set up to allow things like this to happen again. The prosecutors could care less if the accused is actually guilty.  They need the conviction to further their career, and that's all that matters. 

If the accuses elects to fight the allegations he/she can face with jail time if unable to pay the bail.  Then it appears that the court system would rather drag out the trial, defend the officer, or anything to prevent an acknowledgement of a flawed system that would require actions to correct the system. 

I am frightened that despite the constant stories of how flawed our system is we are powerless,  and the truth is any of us can become a victim of the system at any time.

"&gt; For example, when cars are stopped at a stoplight, do cyclists ride up to the front of the line of cars?

Do some other cyclists do that? Yes.

Do I think people should do that? No. Cars can turn or pull over, doors can open, etc. all unexpectedly which can cause a collision with you.

Wait in line with cars like you are one. It's the safest place to be.

&gt; And do we stay on the left or the right?

Unless you are moving at the speed of traffic, stay in the rightmost lane (*or* the leftmost lane if you are on a one-way street). However, **don't hug the curb**; [take the lane for safety!](http://www.bicyclesafe.com) Taking the lane prevents a ton of common types of collisions. This also applies on downhill bike lanes. For example, on westbound E Pine St (downhill) in Capitol Hill, I take the full lane and stay out of the [door zone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Door_zone) bike lane.

&gt; What if we're stopped in the right lane and a car wants to turn right?

I don't filter up to the side of cars, and this is one reason I recommend you don't either. It creates ambiguities. Predictability is life.

If you are in the lane, and a driver behind you wants to turn right, they can wait their turn like anyone else.

&gt; Do we have to stay on the left-hand side of the right turn lane? Or do they just have to tough it out and wait?

Stay in the middle of the lane, or *just* slightly to the left.

Do not get out of the way specifically so the car can turn. This leaves you little to no safe space for yourself. **Never compromise your own safety for others' convenience on the road.** A driver behind you who wants to turn needs to wait their turn. Bicycles and cars each *share* the road, both are vehicles with equal legal access to the road.

&gt; The bike lanes are super clear and easy, but they're not exactly everywhere.

And some of the ones that are present are in the door zone. As I mentioned, be careful and/or stay out of those.

&gt; When you're in traffic, are you in the right lane at all times?

Frequently, unless I am keeping up with traffic. (Often this is easy during rush hour.) You may also legally travel slower than the speed of traffic in the leftmost lane on a one-way street, or in any lane when preparing to make a turn.

&gt; Do you stay on the right-hand side or the left-hand side of the lane when you want to turn left?

Turn left like a car.

Signal left, change lanes to the left, signal left, turn left. Like a car.

&gt; I can ask ""what if___?"" all day, so even just general guidelines would be helpful. If there's anything out there that's been helpful to read, do share. I appreciate the help.

Feel free to ask any more questions, but in general:

* Act like a car. Most (but not all!) traffic laws that apply to motor vehicles also apply to vehicles (bicycles are vehicles).
* To go with the above, **be predictable.** Signal turns. Stop at stop signs. Wait at lights. Take the lane. The more you act like a car, the more drivers know how to act around you. I ride every day on Seattle public streets, and I act like a car. I have *very few* issues with other vehicles on the road. Predictability is life.
* Just because another cyclist does something on the road doesn't mean that thing is smart or safe. Becoming immune to peer pressure will help keep you alive.
* Get lights and use them. I have **six** lights. Visibility is life.

"1. How are they going to toll? Automatic/camera tolling would require some sort of RFID/license system and enforcement would be tough. What about toll jumpers? Manned tolling stations would be cost-prohibitive, especially considering point 2...

2. How much would be appropriate to toll? If we're going for ""fair is fair"" as Sen. King says, bikes should be tolled somewhere around the rate of [1/9600 the toll of a car](http://i.imgur.com/rbX9iCE.jpg). This is because one car causes the damage to a road surface equivalent to 9600 bikes. Indeed, what San Francisco's more liberal estimates found when looking at tolling bikes on the Golden Gate Bridge is that ""if the average vehicle weighs 4,500 pounds and is charged a $6 toll, then the average bicycle at 20 pounds should be charged 2.5¬¢. Flipping this equation around, if a $1 toll is levied on bicyclists, this would equate to a $240 toll on auto drivers."" At a fair price point to cyclists it costs more to administer the program than you would ever get out of it in bicycle toll revenue.

3. Why can't cyclists just dismount to walk over the bridge? Are they going to charge pedestrians walking across the bridge if they have a bicycle beside them?

4. Should children be tolled? How would that be enforced? At what age?

6. And that's not even touching the sticky issue that any kind of bike toll RFIDs or license plates are a de-facto bike registration system.

Your prejudiced generalizations and ignorance about racial inequality is unsurprising and further evidence of the need to educate our society on social injustices.

Black people have only been deemed equal citizens under law for five decades. This formal change in law changed no political or economic conditions for the black population, and they've been subdued and forced to stay at the bottom of the social/economic ladder through systemic policy initiatives. We have more defacto racial segregation in schools than we did 30 years ago. Economic inequality has been skyrocketing across racial lines.

Just because you're ignorant of these facts doesn't mean they don't exist. I hope that you start listening.

"Know what the greatest part about that is?  We used to have that in the United States.  The Telecommunications Act of 1996 required that incumbent local carriers share their copper access lines; shockingly, under ""Title 2,"" the very thing that the FCC seeks to reimpose, without, of course, the open access provisions.  Originally, the idea was to require UNE--unbundled network element--requirements to extend to cable and fiber networks but the cable company lobby killed it on the grounds that cable companies had never benefited from universal service fund grants so they weren't actually ""telecommunications companies.""

In 2003, the FCC completely ""forbade,"" or eliminated, the UNE requirement because the broadband market was deemed ""competitive.""  Between 1999 (when UNE was fully implemented) and 2005 (when Southwestern Bell and GTE-turned-Verizon chopped the last of their linesharing agreements), I had service from four different ISPs.  Remember Speakeasy (a Seattle company, for what it's worth)?  Covad?  Earthlink DSL?  All of these were beneficiaries of those provisions.  DSLreports.com came into existence solely to report on this new, competitive landscape from the 1996 Act.  And then, the landscape withered.

I also remember that getting service through lineshared or dedicated line DSL was like pulling teeth from a pissed off tiger with no anesthetic.  Southwestern Bell was *renowned* for ""losing"" orders.  GTE would simple declare a Central Office ""out of facilities"" (no more DSL or loop space) and then turn around and market directly to the customer requesting service from the competitive carrier.

In short, the telcos and the cable companies have *never* played fair in this country and we've *never* held them to any competitive, build-out, or network capacity requirements.  Even what little we got--back when 5Mbps service on an SDSL connection was considered ultra-high-speed broadband--was dragged kicking and screaming from the ILECs.

"Patrol car camera captured a gunman firing toward officers on a South Seattle street New Year's Eve. Seattle Shooting 12/31/2014
(Seattle Police) Patrol car cameras were rolling New Year‚Äôs Eve after a gunman fired toward officers on a South Seattle street.
The shooting came minutes after police responded, for the second time New Year‚Äôs Eve, to a report of a domestic violence incident at a home in the 4200 block of S. Eddy Street.
Officers were first called to the home shortly after 10 PM after receiving a report of a domestic dispute between a man and a woman. Officers investigated the incident and left the scene to complete their report.
A short time later, around 10:30 PM, police returned to the home after receiving a second 911 call from the victim, who said the suspect had kicked a door and was making threats.
By 10:35, officers were interviewing the suspect as he sat on the hood of a patrol car parked on S. Eddy Street. This is where video of the incident begins
In the video, officers are seen speaking with the domestic violence suspect as, off-camera, one vehicle pulled up rapidly behind the officer‚Äôs patrol car and another vehicle stopped farther down the block.
Officers heard gunfire and quickly took cover behind the patrol car, shielded the domestic violence suspect, and returned fire. Police believe the gunman‚Äôs car then pulled away. No one was injured in the incident.
Three officers involved in the incident are on paid administrative leave, per standard department policy. The officers include a nine-year veteran with the department, a five-year veteran, and another experienced officer, who was serving his first day on patrol in Seattle after transferring from another police agency out-of-state.
SPD‚Äôs Force Investigations Team will continue to investigate the shooting as homicide detectives search for the gunman. The department will release more details about this incident as information becomes available.

Anyone with information about this case should call the SPD tip line at (206) 233-5000.

Yes, an educated workforce is a benefit. However, every single person has equal opportunity to utilize this workforce. You cannot punish someone for having a business-worthy idea and attracting those people.

&gt;they are benefiting from the state in that their educated workforce has a means by which they can get to work

If the company owner is responsible for paying for more road $ because his employees use those roads (which he isn't), then he should also be rewarded for being a job creator, which in turn brings in even more taxes (which more than offsets the $ used by those employees).

&gt;Basically, without the structure of the State, Mr. $1M has almost no chance of actually creating that much wealth

I think you vastly overestimate what it takes to be a millionaire in terms of infrastructure. The way you phrase it sounds like it can only result from a massive engineering or manufacturing business. However, it is estimated that Microsoft alone created ~10,000 millionaires before the year 2000, many of whom are probably individual contributors. Think of what Amazon or any other techie/service company has done similarly. These people use the roads/infrastructure no more than minimum wage workers, but they pay far more in tax dollars. To add to that, they do not receive gov't assistance in any way.

In the case of the large manufacturers and engineering firms, those businesses pay their own tax dollars to support the infrastructure. The millionaires salary is his income from the business, which is again taxed. It is unfair for him to pay for the whole company again simply because he is a leader.

&gt;Because without everyone else, the rich person cannot be rich. Plain and simple.

"IATSE member, full-time sound mixer and former board member of the Northwest Screenwriter's Guild here.  

I live in LA.

Washington had a film commission back in the '90s.  *Sleepless in Seattle* and *Assassins* were an easy choice to shoot in Seattle.  Then the regulations  got stiffer and stiffer and stiffer.  There was a moment when both Washington's film economy and New Mexico's film economy were in the same spot: dying on the vine and trying to survive.

New Mexico asked [Peter Dekom](http://dekomlaw.com) what sorts of things might attract film business to New Mexico and then enacted his every suggestion.  

Washington laid off its film commission.

[New Mexico generated $1.5bln in economic output and gained 16,000 jobs.](http://variety.com/2014/film/news/tax-incentives-build-thriving-production-culture-in-new-mexico-1201283012/)

[Washington became a laughing-stock.](http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/Content?oid=592323)

Lars von Trier shot [Dancer in the Dark](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53vr9EiOH7g) partly in Edmonds.  It won the Palm d'Or at Cannes.  And he *stole every shot.*  Nothing was permitted.  Why?  Because shooting in Seattle is such a cast-iron bitch.  The only city in the United States that's worse is San Francisco.  

Seattle has an *amazing* potential to be a gigantic film city.  But it just isn't.  You have to rent nearly everything from Los Angeles or Vancouver, permits are fucking impossible and there's no incentive whatsoever to do it.  So if you need something in Seattle (like, say, Grey's Anatomy or Frasier) you shoot it in LA and then peel off a splinter crew to shoot B-roll for a few days to make it look authentic.  

And that's because nobody wants it badly enough.

Kinda funny, considering how highly everyone regards SIFF.
