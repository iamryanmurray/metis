"&gt; Also, spoiler alert, car speedometers are regularly off by as much as 10%. 

That isn't true.  It's illegal for a speedometer to have precision less than 5% (so your speed can't be 2.5% higher than what is displayed), and most speedometers have precision better than 1% (0.5% above or below).  That translates to about two tenths of one mile per hour in a 35 mph zone. ([source](http://www.foxnews.com/leisure/2012/05/11/how-fast-are-really-going-accuracy-speedometers/))

More importantly, speedometers are calibrated to err on displaying a number that is slightly higher than your actual speed. ([source](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-drive/culture/commuting/why-you-may-not-be-driving-as-fast-as-you-think/article11487709/))

&gt;And it varies as your tires wear.

Tires get smaller as they wear, so if this really did affect speedometer accuracy it would mean you're going slower than your speedometer thinks you are (linear speed = 2 * radius * pi * angular speed).  (No source for this- should be common sense)

"For perspective, Vancouver's (Canada) tenant laws are totally different. Pretty much everything is in favour of the tenant. Landlords cannot raise rent more than like 3% a year (roughly), they can't ask for more than one months security deposit, they can only charge one pet deposit no matter how many pets you have, and that can't be more than one months rent, if they fail to fill out specific forms and do a thorough inspection prior to a tenant moving in, they forfeit taking any of your security deposit, and they also can't just kick someone out. The only way they can make you move is if they are doing major renovations (ie ripping apart the whole place) or if they or an immediate family member is moving in (no aunts/uncles/third cousins/etc).

It's pretty nice to live somewhere, as a tenant, without having to worry that your landlord is going to throw you out with little notice or hike up your rent to an ungodly amount that you can't afford.

"It's even easier to drive at or below the speed limit.  There are signs posted on the right side of the road with speeds on them. If you drive at a speed that is greater than the speeds written on those signs under the word ""SPEED LIMIT"", then you are breaking the law. It really cannot be more simple, but that's still too much for a lot of people to process. There is absolutely nothing wrong with funding the city by charging people who can't figure this out.

(Also, to preemptively answer those of you who are going to bring up speedometer precision, it's illegal for a speedometer to have precision less than 5% (so your speed can't be 2.5% higher than what is displayed), and most speedometers have precision better than 1% (0.5% above or below).  That translates to about two tenths of one mile per hour in a 35 mph zone. ([source](http://www.foxnews.com/leisure/2012/05/11/how-fast-are-really-going-accuracy-speedometers/))

More importantly, speedometers are calibrated to err on displaying a number that is slightly higher than your actual speed. ([source](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-drive/culture/commuting/why-you-may-not-be-driving-as-fast-as-you-think/article11487709/)))

Research shows that reduced speed limit in urban areas is likely to bring about a reduction in average travel speed and have a desirable impact on both the number of accidents and accident outcome severity ([source 1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1127572/ ), [source 2](http://trrjournalonline.trb.org/doi/abs/10.3141/1908-18)).  One study suggests that an urban speed of 20 miles per hour would be safest ([source](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1127572/)).  This is below most speed limits in Seattle.  

Finally, as long as you are driving in your car's top gear (usually about 30 miles per hour), driving slower saves gasoline, which should be a good thing to a city that claims to care about the environment ([source](http://ecomodder.com/forum/showthread.php/speed-vs-mpg-charts-post-em-if-you-15182.html)).",,,,cacky_bird_legs,,,1445212644,t5_2qhad,t3_3p8zra,t1_cw4dtie,-24,1447052793,0,0,cw4kjz0,Seattle,-24,,

"So new company buys a building. The listing for the building specifically said not to bother the tenants. (http://www.johnlscott.com/MultiFamily/795605/NWM/6511-Rainier-Ave-S-Seattle-WA-98118/)   The new company buys the property probably based more on location than condition.   Did the buyers not disturb the tenants?  Did the tenants not want the buyer to go into their apartments to see the wiring conditions and the vermin?  

  The new company tells the tenants that their rents are being raised.  Tenants go to the media and to some people who like to be in front of the cameras to make a fuss out of the living conditions in their homes.  New company is spending money on improvements, and is raising rents to cover what was obviously a lot of deferred maintenance.  How much of that deferred maintenance was caused by the low rents being collected by the building?  If they had been charged more would the building have been in better shape?  The current conditions are in no way the fault of the current landlord and the grandstanding in front of the cameras trying to saddle them with it is just pandering.  

There were no complaints filed before the new owners came in according the the DPD website.  It was perfectly acceptable to the tenants to live without heat, without working stoves, with dangerous wiring, and with cockroaches and rodents for ten years until a new owner comes in and wants to fix the place up.  The issue seems to be much more about the rent increase than it is about the living conditions, which the tenants were perfectly willing to accept until the building was sold.

"Well, to start with, lose the Ugg boots. They're gross. 

Second, instead of only buying based on brands you see heavily advertised, try and read some magazines or websites and develop a style based less on brands, and more on what you think looks good. 

Third, stop buying your coffee at Starbucks. It's the McDonald's of coffee, and with those Ugg boots, you're starting to seem like a giant stereotype of a basic bitch who's never gone outside the lines in anything she's done. I'm not saying you can never drink Starbucks, or you can never buy some branded stuff, but try not to let shop windows at Bellevue Square define the limits of who you are as a person. 

Finally, if you want a burrito, seriously, buy one anywhere that isn't Chipolte. It's a chain that was started by McDonald's and literally makes the worst burritos in America.

If you take any of that advice, you'll rise above being an easily profiled, dull, consumer drone and enjoy life more, with better coffee, better burritos, and quite possibly a better sense of style.

"And that's why Washington Democratic  sit comfortably despite making poor decisions like this CISA vote: Their core sees the alternative as being far worse, so there's no repercussions. Our reps are too big to fail and we're holding them up out of fear a hypothetical greater evil.

But as voters, it's our duty to think long-term when our representatives don't. Voting against Murray and Cantwell would potentially hurt in the next 6 years, but voting for them will hurt for much longer. In Washington, a Republican Senator would have to be a centrist. And even then there's a good chance of them being a 1-term Senator because the left-leaning state could turn on them at any moment. And if they aren't centrist, then there will be blowback in 6 years when a far left candidate could get elected because the pendulum has swung too far. Such is the yin and yang of political elections.

It pains me to say this, but I'll vote for whoever is running against Murray and Cantwell, even if they're worse in the short term, because having CISA and TPP supporters in the Senate is worse in the long run.",,,,CurlSagan,,,1445994464,t5_2qhad,t3_3qhf8b,t1_cwfap12,61,1447243014,0,0,cwfc1dk,Seattle,61,,

"I think you're overstating things a bit. I drive downtown every day for work.

Your commute time goes up a few minutes here and there, but no real congestion (especially if you don't need to jump on an onramp). Your narrative of all day gridlock isn't true.

How about transit options for them that work? Rather than financially penalizing people into suckier options because density. The reason people use their cars is because it's a *better* option for them. It will still be a *better* option if you have a congestion charge, but now the poor will have a lower quality of life.

"&gt; What I'm reading is they didn't plan for their retirement.

What you're reading is that you don't know what they did or didn't do.

&gt; Social Security is a supplement for retirement savings

Partially true and partially false, so let's deal with your next phrase in conjunction:

&gt; it was never meant to be the sole source of income during retirement.

Yes, it was, insofar as the original intent of the ""Old-Age Insurance Program"" was to prevent senior citizens from retiring into poverty.  However, remember that when the original Social Security act was signed, in 1935, *pensions* were the primary source of retirement funds.  More than that, *company-funded* pensions were that.  You may have noticed that such a situation no longer sustains, and people like Ms. Reynolds were caught in the crosshairs.  Or, Ms. Reynolds' sister Mary Jo was.

Consider that it's entirely possible that Mary Jo was married and she and her husband intended to draw on his pension.  But perhaps he died early, prior to being able to collect, or his company went bankrupt.  Or they did have savings through one of the then-newly-introduced 401k plans but those savings got wiped out in the economic collapse a handful of years ago and there hasn't been enough time to recover.  (Note that, for many workers, their 401k plans may now be doing quite well but that's a function of a higher market *and* continuing to contribute, something a retired person can't do.)

So you've no way of knowing why Mary Jo, Ms. Reynolds, or any of their cohort are solely reliant upon Social Security.",,,,somenewuser,Central Area,,1445807584,t5_2qhad,t3_3q60s2,t1_cwcklu1,13,1447192777,0,0,cwclzia,Seattle,13,,flair

"I don't understand why this always has to be such a contentious issue. The facts and options are pretty straightforward. If you don't like the population growth of this city, then Amazon and the other tech companies would need to be evicted to put an end to it. We all know that's not going to happen so we are left with 2 options to support the growth...
1) Sprawl--Any ""preservationist"" effort to limit growth within the city is in support of sprawl. This is not an opinion--if you cannot provide housing within the city then people are going to have to move outside of the city. Along with this would come a significant need to increase the investment in highways and other infrastructure. I have not seen any examples where mass transit systems work well for sprawling metros. Housing prices within the city increase more substantially but houses farther away from the city center would be much more affordable.
2) Density-Easier to maintain and support mass transit. The ""character"" of many neighborhoods would change. Dense cities are often considered more ""desirable"" because of the social amenities that come along with them. Therefore, prices would continue to be expensive within the city, but not as much as with option 1 (see san fran); however, it does leave the option to create affordable housing within the city limits.

The debate needs to be around if we want option 1 or 2 for the city. Anything else is just a distraction from the real choices that need to be made.",,,,mfisher04,,,1444325192,t5_2qhad,t3_3nz11y,t3_3nz11y,64,1446848028,0,0,cvsoy0z,Seattle,64,,

"This is great perspective but i really don't think the state is *entirely* to blame. I think it will take a cumulative effort on law enforcement, public utilities and state officials to actually get serious about the issue before trying to address it with bandaid fixes. First, good on you for reporting it. Im not sure why that doesn't happen more often (hell it probably does, we just don't hear about it). The needles thing is really unacceptable and disguising and dangerous, all rolled into one lol. But given that it is state property (i assume you live somewhere near the interstate?) the 3 day eviction notice seems normal, thats what they would do in any squatter situation. Its unfortunate and im sure they took advantage of it, knowing that had that buffer. 

Its been brought up that if some of these camps had access to a trashcan or dumpster, some of them might actually throw things away and clean up after themselves. Your example bolsters my point that a good majority of them are disrespectful, and most likely won't clean up after themselves. Even with an open dumpster right across the street. Like i was saying, i think a triaged approach needs to happen. Law enforcement needs to step in and actually *enforce* the no trespass at these sites. Public utilities and state officials need to provide better access controls into these areas. Most of the fences are torn down or falling, have holes and gashes cut right through them. Some areas are not blocked off at all.

"You are aware that excluding everyone except white people is specifically targeting people based on the color of their skin, or rather specifically not allowing them to be included, it's marginalization in of itself. The entire idea that everyone besides Caucasians also suffer from all of what you've listed is you propagating the same marginalization and issues you so care to defend in that of non-Caucasian people. 

For example even your claim that this group disallowed Caucasians to prevent aggression and racial profiling is in itself racially profiling and negatively stereotyping people.

If you don't think all people including white people also suffer from the same issues then you need to wake up, any simple Google search can tell you that.

I've no issue with people creating groups or spaces for people of certain races, the issue is both the claim that everyone except white people suffer from racism, violence, etc. And also the issue that if people were to create this exact same yoga class but with it being a space respectfully asking only Caucasians to come then it would be immediately scrutinized on a national level.

I'm in full support of this group if a similar group specifically for Caucasians, would be allowed to come to fruition without immediately being shut down. 

Also, white is a color. I don't pick sides, anyone who would claim to say it's okay if X race, gender, or sexuality does this but not okay if X gender, sexuality, or race is a person who is in favor of inequality and propagates hatred between all of the above.",,,,californiakoalafied,,,1444366263,t5_2qhad,t3_3o22te,t1_cvtdtks,11,1446860132,1,0,cvte81m,Seattle,11,,

"It's not legal, but it really should be. And even if it is, it's really not very enforceable if you're filtering on a bike through stopped traffic. (Unless the cop is on a bike).

I do this occasionally on my daily commute from Seattle to Bellevue. 

As was mentioned, filtering to the front is not dangerous, provided you're not going over 15mph faster than the rest of traffic. (I generally won't do it unless traffic is at a standstill). I disagree with those who thinks bikes should act exactly the same as cars. They are two fundamentally different machines. There are universal rules that should apply, (lights, signals, double yellow lines, speed (Although I'm guilty of breaking that rule on cars and bikes both), but if i, or anyone else, can filter to the front without making someone else's commute worse, than why the hell wouldn't I?

"So, a couple of rebuttals:

&gt; I can certainly say no matter how bike friendly Seattle ever becomes, I'm still going to be in a car when I come up there.

And you will eventually pay an even greater time penalty for being in a single-occupant vehicle in the most populated city in the state.  You are 100% entitled to that choice, for sure.  The crux of the matter is that there is physically no place to put any more roads in the city, *especially* not high capacity roads.  SDOT is, under the Council's direction, enacting a plan of using roads to move *people*, not cars, and if that means that SOVs take the brunt of the traffic then the citizens of Seattle have deemed that OK.  (Or will have deemed it so after voting for Bridging the Gap and, hopefully, Move Seattle.)

&gt;  And people who are commuting from god only knows how far away since it costs a fortune to live there will also be driving there. 

Again, that's their right to do so.  But as I've consistently pointed out here in /r/seattle, Seattle voters are building the Seattle that they want not that the daytime commuters want.  Yes, commuters and workers and business owners spend money here and generate tax revenue and economic activity.  That's awesome, many thanks for that.  Ultimately, they leave and we don't.  Seattle voters have consistently voted in favor of alternative modes of transportation and we invite you all to use them.

One of two things will have to happen in order to mitigate crush loads of cars on Seattle streets: Either people will decide to take other modes of transportation because they've tired of waiting behind all of the other people who decided to drive or Seattle will become economically unattractive as a destination to live and work.  If someone wants to advocate for that second one, I'd like to point out that *many* people's economic, personal, and social livelihoods depend on your failure, so choose accordingly.",,,,somenewuser,Central Area,,1445320853,t5_2qhad,t3_3pgd34,t1_cw644a4,19,1447079458,0,0,cw64a2p,Seattle,19,,flair

"holy. crap... 
  
I think this is my stuff!?!  It was stolen from the amazon parking lot about a month ago. The mens sunglasses were mine and the women's are my wife's. I will PM you in a minute with some details. I have pictures of me in the glasses. The jacket should be grey and is pretty large either 2x or (maybe 3x I cant remember) It's gortex and the bag was a generic black backpack with some extra kids clothes and stuff I kept in the car. 

Thanks you so much for posting this. I will gladly offer you a reward and my eternal* gratefulness if it happens to be my stuff. 

EDIT: a word

I pm'd a couple pics of the glasses. Fingers crossed. 

EDIT 2: still waiting to hear back. I'm guessing internet access isn't easy access. I will post another update as soon as I hear back. 

EDIT 3: I tried to link up with OP today to see if the belongs were mine but unfortunately was unable to locate him. Turns out finding someone you've never met with no phone is a pretty difficult task. OP do you have red hair and dreds? A couple people I asked around described your appearance but hadn't seen you around today. Maybe later this week we can try again.

"My business is heavily regulated DHS/TSA and let me tell you, this kind of bureaucratic nonsense runs rampant.  They do everything in the name of safety of course but if you ever press them on proving their success, they immediately go into ""that information isn't public"" mode.  I'd say it's a joke, but it's really not funny.  This organization costs taxpayers so much more than they even realize.  Ignore the fact that they're the largest non-military cabinet in our government that has a budget of nearly $100 Billion annually - the organization creates huge secondary costs that we all pay for through consumption.  I cannot overstate how much this group has raised the cost of transportation over the past 14 years.  Many companies folded up shop because complying with regulations became too difficult or the fines too expensive.  I doubt the amount of jobs created in the ""Compliance Assistance Industry"" matches the job lost by companies closing up shop.  But hey, at least we have more people relying on the government for work at the TSA now, so it's not a complete loss.

I can't stress this next part enough - I am not an anti regulation, let businesses do whatever they want nut job.  I completely think we need them.  What I'm saying is that these people are so inefficient and so unproductive with their regulations, that I'm surprised we don't have attacks on a daily basis.  I believe, and I could be wrong, that the only reason we don't is because those who have the motive to do it are simply choosing not to for their own reasons that have nothing to do with possibly being caught by the TSA.",,,,royaljohnson,,,1446151928,t5_2qhad,t3_3qqh98,t3_3qqh98,83,1447282139,0,0,cwhlt3k,Seattle,83,,

"I worked at a large scale (&gt;100 light) medical grow for several months. I was terrified at the amount of pesticides they were using. Their product (poison) is being pushed in many of Seattle's MMJ dispensaries. The ""Master Grower"" was an amateur at best and didn't know what the fuck he was doing. He was wholly unqualified for the position. His main source of information were salesmen at the large grow stores who would tell him anything to get him to buy $1000's of unnecessary products. He was failing at running the grow op and the weed was crap. There was a never-ending bug problem and the product was covered in powdery mildew. His response was to buy and use more and more chemical products in an attempt to correct these problems. This resulted in the plants being stressed and not using their own natural defenses. Thus the production quota was low and the plants would get more infected. This resulted in him seeking even more detrimental techniques..... and on and on and on it went.

I made a list of 21 pesticides, miticides, fungicides, leaf washes, etc. that were being used including the known human toxins Eagle 20, Imidacloprid, Floramite, Forbid, and Pylon. Many were being used well into the flowering cycle beyond the systemic parameters for how long the chemical compounds stay within the tissue of the plant.

I went to the owners and explained the situation and offered to run the place properly including a guarantee of producing a product that we could get tested as clean. They wouldn't even smoke their own product due to the known pesticide contents. Inexplicably, even though the ""Master Grower"" wasn't meeting quotas, didn't know what he was doing, didn't know proper principles of ~~EPM~~ IPM, *and* was stealing from them, he wasn't fired and is still working there. I was rebuffed in my offer. I couldn't take it anymore and have since left, partly out of frustration and partly due to concerns for my health being exposed to these toxins.

My point being, that the concerns that are addressed in the linked article are very real. Even though getting the product tested may increase the costs, it is a necessity as this industry grows and becomes mainstream. I would like to see a thriving industry that has the same integrity as any mainstream business. But I would have to say, as of right now, you are still better off buying on the black market if you know a grower personally and can trust their product.",,,,rayrayww2,,,1444181976,t5_2qhad,t3_3nqzbo,t3_3nqzbo,12,1446815545,0,0,cvqt9wj,Seattle,12,,

"&gt;Your faux-color-blind editing is completely ignorant of the context of this country's racism. 

I'm not trying to deny that institutional racism exists.  I am simply stating that banning people from an establishment based on the color of their skin is racism, no matter what skin color has been banned.

&gt;Systemic, structural racism is contingent on which demographic holds the power in a society.

Agreed, but that's not what's being discussed here.  This is a Yoga class banning people due to their skin color.

&gt;Seattle's systemic racism is dictated by its majority white population - as is true for most of the United States.

Again, I agree, but in context, this is irrelevant.

&gt;If you had any education whatsoever on the history of racism in the U.S. and Seattle, you'd see that discriminating against and oppressing the black population has always been a component of this city's - and country's - culture.

Contrary to what you may believe, I do know a fair bit about America's racial divide.

&gt;White people aren't being oppressed here. Stop self-victimizing yourself. Educate yourself on the racial history of Seattle and the United States.

And POC aren't being oppressed by being told that they cannot racially discriminate against people.  Racism is wrong, regardless of context.  If were going to go the SJ route on this, I suppose you could call this a ""microaggression"" - It isn't particularly harmful, but it's still morally reprehensible.

&gt;Here's a primer on Seattle's relationship with structural racism against its black population. Learn something today.

If you can't argue these points without repeatedly telling people how much more enlightened you are on the subject then they are, maybe you should just sit this out.  Two people can have different opinions without either being ""wrong"".  I know it's hard to see that in your black-and-white world, but you'll benefit to accept that now rather than alienate yourself later.

POC banning whites from their gatherings is just a way to make the world more divisive.  What is says is ""We will not work together, because we look different"".  It's no different than making a ""whites only"" business so you don't have to feel threatened being around minorities:  It's based on a hatred of an ""other"", in this case Whites, because of their race.

"I don't think you understand how the business model works. As the owner, I take on a certain amount of risk. This includes maintenance issues, non-payment from tenant, and plain vacancy. Units always require fixes in between. They often require professional cleaning. (I give a year-long or more tenant about 2 hours of free professional cleaning before I start charging them.) My units are mortgaged, plus taxes, insurance, utilities. So I have fixed costs. I only have 3 units, and that comprises a large portion of my assets (plus, they're leveraged), so this means if something goes wrong with a single unit, I'm in a much-less-than-ideal spot, financially. In addition, I manage, maintain, and do most of the repairs/upgrades myself or with my husband. I don't just sit there and collect rent (though I wish that was how easy it is--I'd have way more than 3 units, if that were the case). And I do not actually always raise the rent, only when I feel like I have to. What does it mean to ""have to"" raise the rent? There are typically three scenarios:

1. If I don't raise the rent, the profit is no longer worth the risk and time I spend managing the property. My husband and I both work full time jobs, so there is actually an hourly rate where below that, it's not worth it for us to own rental properties.

2. I have certain amount of equity in the property. If I sell the property and invest the cash I get in stocks, and the expected return from that is as high or higher than my rental profit, even accounting for risk, then I should sell the house. (I actually have been trying to not do this as I have below market rents and really good tenants I don't want to have to kick out.)

3. If my rent is too far below market rent, and raising it all the way to market would be too much of a sticker shock. This is mostly because tenants hate the idea of rent raises. If someone has been living somewhere for way below market, rather than counting their good fortune when they have to pay market rent, they usually get mad at whoever made the change. I would like to be able to sell the property eventually (or turn it over to a property management company, for example, if I move away from the city) and don't want them to suffer sticker shock and hate me.

"&gt; I believe that infrastructure should move as many people as efficiently as possible. Everyone pays taxes for the roads, and slowing down the vast majority of commuters, unless they pay extra, goes against the fundamental purpose of public roads.

That's a hopeless goal.  We've designed infrastructure to move as many people as efficiently as possible for decades.  The usage increases faster than any achievable infrastructure improvements.  By the time you add an extra lane you're in dire need of two more.  The fundamental problem is economic.  When you provide a scarce good for free it will be overutilized.  That overutilization is *not* an economic positive.

"&gt;you are appropriating the intellectual property and work of another without compensation

Great argument for why it is wrong, and i agree - but it has nothing to do with theft.  Don't confuse the argument about whether it is theft with the argument about whether it is wrong.  Pirating music removes nothing from anyone else's possession.  It is and should be prohibited, and its definitely wrong, but nothing is removed from anyone's possession.  Just exactly as riding the bus without paying your share.  

Or, hell, even more precise analogy: not paying your toll on 520.  That is damn well **exactly**, the same thing - using a for-pay public service without paying.  And, surprise, its a civil penalty.

Do you *seriously* want to argue that people not paying 520 tolls should all have criminal penalties instead of civil?  That's fucking absurd - just like your insistence that bus fare skippers should have criminal instead of civil penalties.

"&gt; eh, that's crap. he doesn't get to blow a red because he's not likely to kill someone, the point of traffic lights is to control traffic - so i don't have do deal with idiots coming at me from the side. he's just lazy and doesn't want to stop/start.

I'm not saying it's a good thing, I'm just saying it's not as severe a problem, when one thing is likely to kill people and the other isn't. I support the [Idaho stop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idaho_stop), but cyclists who just blow through red lights and stop signs should absolutely be ticketed.

But really, the whole road system is set up to favor cars over pedestrians and bikes. Peds are second class citizens, and bikes usually third class. It's not a surprise when people 'jaywalk' or ignore some signals when the system isn't designed to support them well and they're only putting themselves at risk. Again, I'm not saying it's ok, just that it's not realistic to expect otherwise.

&gt; yup, and i don't think you've really proved anything with a survey.

The data we do have says they break the law at the same rate. My own experience as someone who frequently drives and bikes goes in line with that. If you got any other data to support your point, I'm happy to take a look at it.

&gt; Marshall has studied several large biking communities and says cyclists and drivers generally run red lights at the same rate. And while a change in culture will help curb this negative perception, he says infrastructure could be the big game changer.

&gt; ""As cities have added more bicycle infrastructure, I have seen studies from Chicago and New York, as they put in cycle tracks or lights specific to the biker, the rates of obeying the law went from 30 percent to 80 percent,"" Marshall said.

Now, requiring development to have a minimum number of parking spaces IS silly. If people want them and are willing to pay market rate for them (either explicitly, or implicitly through increased rent/mortgage for properties that have it), then that's what developers will build, because they love money. Leaving that up to the market means people vote with their wallets for how much parking they actually need.

On the other hand, if you force minimum parking requirements onto new developments, then that raises the cost of housing even for people who don't want or need said parking. Which is dumb.

"Every city has terrible drivers... but I think that no city in the US can hold a candle to a city in the developing world. Try driving in a provincial Chinese city: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8Zpyei3KJQ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8bfNplEmfo 

Now THAT is some truly atrocious driving.  

EDIT: in response to u/dwwojcik, I have created a tiered system of bad drivers: 

* Tier 0: America, most of Western Europe, Australia, and other highly developed countries. People like to moan and complain, but for the most part... drivers aren't that bad.

* Tier 1: Spain, Italy, France, and Argentina. Flamboyant driving here is the norm, but still somewhat orderly overall.

* Tier 2: South/Latin America (Argentina can go between Tiers 1 and 2). More flamboyant than Tier 1, definitely something to write home about. Driving just goes way downhill from here.

* Tier 3: China, SE Asia, maybe Russia (can go in Tiers 2 and 3). There are rules, but they only occasionally enforced (except for drunk driving in China's case). People REALLY drive like maniacs in these countries. Originator of many dash cam videos. Road network in these countries are pretty well developed, but the driver training/knowledge are still not up to Western standards.

* Tier 4: India. India is in a league of its own. While it has a somewhat okay road network, its drivers are as crazy if not more than Tier 3. The difference is: there are tons of modes of transport jockeying for space as compared to the other tiers. In Tiers 0-3, most modes of transport have their own space, with mixing at times. In India, the modes of transit seem limitless: wheels, feet, even animals share finite road space. Sidewalks? Who needs 'em?

* Tier 5: sub-Saharan Africa, Haiti, and other extremely poor countries. Rules? What rules? Fuck this crap, I need to get somewhere, and I need to get there NOW! Carrying capacity is always ""I can fit one more"": vans can carry as many people as possible (seats and seatbelts be damned), same goes for motorcycles (great family transport!), trucks (oh, that propane bottle will fit puts bottle precariously on top of giant pile of stuff on an ancient beat up truck), and any other wheeled conveyance. Attempting to drive in any country Tiers 3 and above is more or less like signing a death wish. 

EDIT: countries in Tier 5 often have very poor road networks. Anything that can be driveable counts as a road: broken up city street, dirt track, even a flat field.

"I work at University of Washington, and Amazon is currently trying to pursue a new ameliorative PR campaign with selective donations.

Since Amazon's PR blunders this year with several national stories covering their poor work culture, anti-labor stances, and lack of social conscience or philanthropy, Amazon has recently hired PR agents to research which potential donations would create the best public image. Since Amazon has little to no experience with philanthropy, they're trying to figure out which donations would give them the best PR face value.

Several departments at UW have had group meetings with these Amazon-sponsored PR guys, to try and pitch their respective fields as being ""good for PR"" - including everything from biochemistry from development economists. 

There's no publicized source on this, other than the various reps from UW's academic departments that have had a series sit-downs with Amazon's PR people.

While the government does spend a lot of money on vendors to implement large clunky systems there's (some) legitimate reasons why that is vs. a home baked solution.

"There is plenty of science behind it.

You can google ""speed pedestrian fatalities"" and get dozens of peer reviewed studies on it, from varied sources.

The presumption is that if people are decelerating from 30mph, or 20mph in a school zone, the odds of an impact being fatal plummet, because the speed is not where the fatality threshold is.

If you're going 32, and can only decelerate to the threshold, because stopping distance increases exponentially, you have accomplished nothing.  These numbers have been studied into oblivion. It's the same justification the federal government uses for lane rechannelization ( road diets ) reducing pedestrian fatalities to an acceptable level.

&gt; I also don't believe there are magic discreet numbers that cleanly divide a line between safe and unsafe driving.

You can have whatever opinion you want, but this is easily disproven with magic peer reviewed discrete numbers that have decades of application study on them as well.

"There are plenty of arguments that can be made for and against wearing helmets.

The main reason for not wearing one is hearing. With a helmet on, the noise from the air is significant enough to make it near impossible to hear anything around you. Even worse if you wear a helmet that covers the ears like a motorcycle helmet. I know from experience that motorcycle helmets are the worse when it comes to being able to hear your surroundings. This is why almost everyone I know who rides a bicycle or motorcycle wears headphones to play music. It may be illegal on the roads because it's a distraction and impedes hearing, but it's not anymore impeding than the loud sound of rushing air. Not only that, I have seen more than my share of cyclists wearing helmets with the straps tied away or simply cut off so it looks like they have a helmet on but it's useless.

The main reason for having a helmet is protection of the head in an incident\accident. However, analysis of cyclists and vehicle collisions resulted in majority being the fault of a distracted driver or a negligent driver. There would be far less vehicle and bicycle related incidents if both drivers were less negligent and cyclists rode more defensively. For example, anytime a car passes me while I'm in a bicycle lane, I'm going to assume it may turn right in front of me. A good number of times, they do exactly that, and if I didn't prepare beforehand, I would ride right into them. I wouldn't have to assume if drivers who passed me checked their mirrors and were aware of my presence as they passed.

Removal of helmet requirements have been known to make it safer in many cities. One of the main reasons is because drivers will visibly see that the person is more fragile. For example, it's fairly common for cars to pass a cyclists within the 3 foot space requirement. They wouldn't do the same if the group of cyclists were children because the driver determines the children are more fragile even if they were wearing pads and helmets.

Wearing a helmet is safer for the rider in the event anything happens. I don't think anyone have logically claim otherwise. However, what's more safe, wearing a helmet, or better education of drivers and cyclists.",,,,VietOne,,,1444672060,t5_2qhad,t3_3ogh1g,t1_cvx36w1,10,1446924737,0,0,cvx4ukq,Seattle,10,,

"Lifelong Washingtonian who recently moved to California here. I can tell you, I was always for an income tax, and I still am, but you have to write it in such a way that it doesn't kick poor people in the nuts. 

My family is poor. I have a good Union job at a great organization. But we live in the Bay Area where a grilled cheese sandwich costs $17 (not joking), and the shittiest house on my block just sold for $599,999. 

I lose 10% off the top of my income every month to the State of California in income tax. And I'm in one of the lowest tax brackets. Now, we'll get a lot of that back at the end of the year, but when you're poor, money doesn't work the same way as it does when you're rich. 10% off the top NOW makes a huge difference when you're poor. All those weeks where we ran out of groceries, had to scrape the change jar for bus fare? We probably wouldn't have quite gotten there if I had that 10% in my wallet. 

In San Francisco, $50,000 per year is *barely* enough for two people to survive on. Seattle's getting there too. That 10% kicks people in the $25,000 to $50,000 range in the nuts every paycheck. Badly. 

If you're going to do it, look at what it really costs to support a family in the most expensive part of the State (Seattle). And I'm not talking about these bullshit figures that say if you have three nickels to rub together you're not ""low income,"" I'm saying real talk, what does it cost to support a family of four in Seattle? $65,000? $80,000? Add 20% to that, and make it the barrier to the lowest tax bracket. If you're making less than $95,000 or $100,000 you pay zero income tax. 

Seattle is an expensive ass city that's on it's way to San Franciscan levels of bullshit cost of living. Thinking of someone who makes $50,000 as ""Low Income"" doesn't fit our traditional paradigm, but it's the reality we're looking at now. An income tax can be productive, but not if you're kicking those of us in the ""Donut Hole"" in the nuts. 

A lot of us are too rich to get food stamps, housing assistance, free medical care. But way, way too poor to be able to comfortably afford kissing an extra 10% of our paycheck goodbye every two weeks. So if you're going to do an income tax, put it on people who can actually afford it. Don't kick the Donut Hole families in the nuts with it. /rant",,,,soundslikepuget,Marine Area 7,,1445382983,t5_2qhad,t3_3pj13e,t3_3pj13e,40,1447094400,0,0,cw6zk5s,Seattle,40,,flair

They've done nothing to backfill the missing sidewalks all over Maple Leaf (on the east side of I-5), and Liction Springs (on the west side of I-5) -- and now they are just sitting there with their thumbs up their asses with regards to building this bridge that would help people in Liction Springs and at North Seattle College, get over to the rail station to use mass transit instead of driving.

The pilfered packages usually finish with a local field reporter's standup close. KING5 discards those and films an Enerson studio close where she says whatever the local reporter said.

Essentially, it's a combination of plagiarism, fraud, and misrepresentation. You might conclude Enersen or her producers had reported the HealthLink story. You'd be wrong. KING5 just slaps Enersen's name and face on some other reporter's work.  ",,,,AnotherPint,Edmonds,,1444787172,t5_2qhad,t3_3ollmx,t1_cvygywm,14,1446955458,0,0,cvywxl8,Seattle,14,,flair

"If I'm reading the graphs correctly:

**Morning - **

Any time the blue or purple lines (disregarding yellow because it's an ""estimate"")  are outside the solid black line are INCREASES in drive time (compared to October 2014 average).  What I gather from that is drive times are longer for more hours during the day and much longer at peak time.

**Evening - **

Any time the green or orange lines are outside the solid black line are INCREASES in drive time (compared to October 2014 average).  Again, drive times are longer for more hours during the day starting as early as 2PM.

"Police officers **ALWAYS** shoot to kill, there is no such thing as aiming to immobilize or incapacitate.

1. Shooting anywhere can kill: a shot aiming at the arm or leg could kill just as easily as one to the chest if it strikes a major artery.

2. The shots at extremities or a gun being held are harder:  An offer trying to disarm or stop someone will have a harder time hitting a smaller, and moving part of a person.

3. Missing is bad: Missing a shot on a target means either hitting a different part of the person or someone or something in the backfield, this means innocents can be hurt or killed by a missed shot.

4. Police aren't always crack shots: Police don't train all the time with their guns, most aren't SWAT, ex-special forces, or a hobbyist competitive shooter. They also have limited time to train shooting, and most never even need to shoot. Too add to that many police weapons have a high trigger pull weight, making the shot more innacurate by requiring more force and arm muscle movement to pull the trigger (NYPD is infamous for their workout inducing trigger pull weight).

5. The situations where police are authorized to fire is often when their lives or someone else's life is or could be in danger, its a heat of the moment, they shoot to stop the threat, end stop. With that said a police sniper (a very different situation) could aim to immobilize, but likely would not.

Don't want to sound like I'm coming down hard on you, just wanted to explain the reason why things happen, I've heard the question asked many times before. its not the movies or a videogame, and many cops aren't crack shots. The officer in this case sounds like a good shot though, they are aimed for center mass, and he only fired one shot, which likely was a headshot, stopping the guy instantly. Even if he shot the guy to the chest of heart he likely would of fired multiple times to make sure the guy drops, even with a blown out heart you still have enough blood in your brain to act for several seconds (apparently).",,,,BattleBull,Poulsbo,,1444944670,t5_2qhad,t3_3ow2hl,t1_cw10cer,10,1446993507,0,0,cw14mvt,Seattle,10,,flair

I'd hate for any other city to become like San Francisco, but I worry that Seattle is on that path. There need to be support systems in place, but turning a blind eye and just accepting it is a very slippery slope.

"In WA it seems like it works like this. If there is a wall (doesn't need to be solid or all the way to the ceiling) between the 21+ bar area and the main part of the place, that is easily distinguished, you can have kids in there, if you want.

In other states, usually if you serve food, you can bring in kids unless it's only a bar. In CA kids can go in a bar &amp; grill but they can't sit *at* the bar.

I find it funny that WA is so liberal with pot, but won't let a bar allow kids in to grab a burger with their dad or whatever, because we can't expose our kids to that demon alcohol.

(And I 100% get that you want to go to a bar to escape kids, and certainly if a place wants to be 21+ only that's cool, but it's six kinds of retarded that I can't bring my kid to Black Bottle in Belltown, which is basically a restaurant.)",,,,uptowndevil,,,1445052780,t5_2qhad,t3_3p2n02,t3_3p2n02,10,1447019388,0,0,cw2msd1,Seattle,10,,

Being a parent does not make you qualified to talk about this. Being a manager, someone that trains employees, in HR, or something else qualifies you.

Oh just get a higher paying job! WHY DOESN'T EVERYONE JUST DO THAT?!?!?! Stupid poor people, just be rich instead!

Most of these cameras especially red light cameras are just a way to make money.  Proof being that the cities remove them once they stop becoming profitable. Now the speed cameras in school zones are a good thing AS LONG as they are calibrated correctly. Giving someone a 234.00 ticket for being 1-5 MPH over the speed limit looks like a money grab.  If someone is flying through a school zone 10mph or more over then fine ticket them.

"Interesting article.

While I think he made some good points, I don't think Bills is a good example to cite.  For one, as a regular customer of old Bills, I did not mind going to the new space.  Quite the opposite, its like an updated ""look and feel"" of the old.  

So while I'd like to see smarter development and less big box bullshit being built, I can't really jump on the hate-bandwagon for Bills.  Bills is a great local eatery with great local pizza, strong booze pours, TV if you want it and new tables.  

The fact it's in a new building with an old facade shouldn't be the sole thing you take away from it, unless you just hate all facades and want to make some agenda-driven arguments by citing it.  To me, ultimately, what matters is great local businesses can survive here with the new building onslaught.  Bills appears to be doing just that.  I'd like it if your jihad against dumb development could stay neutral on Bills, because they're one of the ones that made it.

"Indeed, and new housing is ""for the rich"" in the sense that new stuff costs more than old stuff, so of course new housing costs more than old housing. Similarly, a 2016 Honda Civic costs more than a 2012 Honda Civic, but that doesn't indicate that the 2016 Honda Civic is ""for the rich"". It just means that there's a premium for new stuff over old stuff.

So, you have to look at what the effect of supply is on the old stuff, and you'll find that increased supply disinflates rents for everyone. You can look at cities like DC where they made a concerted efforts to increase supply in the face of their housing shortage, and you'll see that rents actually deflated there, not just disinflated there. 

What rent control does is pass the cost off to the unlucky many to help the lucky few, and makes housing construction less profitable and thus less likely - and you'll see that necessarily increases prices. This is an objective question with an objective answer - rent control doesn't help most - only the few.

&gt;Then make sure that the rich are disqualified for those apartments.

Then we'd be the first city to craft our rent control laws in such a way where the 'undeserving' don't get undue government protection.

* Unlike King County Metro, the streetcars are run entirely by SDOT, and have fewer agencies they need to coordinate with.
* This line was built as a compromise after a light rail station in First Hill had to be eliminated, largely because soil structure wouldn't allow for tunneling where they wanted to. This provides rail connections from First Hill and its hospitals to Capitol Hill and ID/Chinatown stations.
* Many people, especially tourists but also those with mobility issues, prefer rail transit over buses.

"&gt; DISSUADED DRIVERS FROM USING THOSE LANES

Part of the goal all along.  [US Code](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/23/166) requires that HOV lanes have a minimum speed of 45 mph 90% of peak hours or be considered degraded.  Degraded facilities must take measures to reduce traffic (increase min occupancy, tolls, or bar exception vehicles (motorcycles, low emission vehicles)).

The USC requirements are part of the Federal-Aid Highway Program, so not meeding them would result in a reduction of federal dollars going to WSDOT.   WSDOT's plan was never to reduce traffic on the onramps, non-express lanes, or even in general, simply to get their 45 mph minimum limit.

"&gt;Major findings: The results from this three-year research study, conducted with over 9,000 students in eight public high schools in three states, reveal that high schools that start at 8:30 AM or later allow for more than 60% of students to obtain at least eight hours of sleep per school night. Teens getting less than eight hours of sleep reported significantly higher depression symptoms, greater use of caffeine, and are at greater risk for making poor choices for substance use. Academic performance outcomes, including grades earned in core subject areas of math, English, science and social studies, plus performance on state and national achievement tests, attendance rates and reduced tardiness show significantly positive improvement with the later start times of 8:35 AM or later. Finally, the number of car crashes for teen drivers from 16 to 18 years of age was significantly reduced by 70% when a school shifted start times from 7:35 AM to 8:55 AM.

Journalists should always assess the credibility and bias of their sources, that's not in dispute. But companies are generally expected (especially in this time of constant litigation) to keep from releasing this sort of performance information, even if it's positive.

"I get it; people feel put upon and overcharged and squeezed and all of those other words.  I really do but I also have little sympathy and here's why:

- Long-time residents: Infrastructure gets built with shiny new money (politicians love to vote for and put projects in front of voters that let them cut a big ribbon on a new bridge or something) but there's never any money included to pay for maintenance and upkeep of that infrastructure.  This bill was going to come due and I think most of you knew that.  That day is, apparently, today.

- New residents: With the exception of some metro areas in the Mountain and Central time zones, I'm almost certain that whatever you were paying in property tax--my certainty level rises to just about 100% if you moved here from a state with no income tax--is higher than what is charged in Seattle.  A lot higher.  My ex house in north Texas cost me, years ago, $3,700/year in property tax.  My house in Seattle is worth more than double that other one was yet I pay $2,900/year in property tax here.  Besides, new residents, a lot of this infrastructure is being built and repaired as a direct response to your having moved here.  That bill's gotta get paid.

Needless to say, I'm a Seattle homeowner who has absolutely no problem with the proposed levy price.  This shit's gotta get done and I'm through waiting on Olympia to cough up the money to give back to Seattle at least a little of what Seattle gives up to the rest of the state.  If voting for our local taxes gives me the freedom to put up the middle finger to areas outside of Puget Sound, so much the better.

Besides, I see a lot of good projects in here even if they're not just in my council district (damn, I knew the arguing over districts would become a thing and here it is).  I'll still use a lot of these because I go all over the city.

Even if I never personally set foot on any of the bridges or corridors or sidewalks or what-have-you in a certain area, it still benefits me.  Why?

*A man could face criminal charges after he allegedly aimed a high-powered laser into the eyes of two ferry captains last week.  One of the captains suffered a damaged retina and a third-degree burn to the eyelid, said Sgt. Christina Martin with the Washington State Patrol.*

...

*The incident happened just after 8:30 p.m. Oct. 22 on the regular run between Mukilteo and Clinton. The suspect was on the car deck of the Kitsap, which was headed to Mukilteo, Martin said. The captains were on the Tokitae, which was passing the other ferry on its way to Clinton.“This is not a typical laser you’d see in a classroom or an office setting,” Martin said.  She described the laser as about 6 inches long and 2 pounds. The manufacturer claims the laser could light a match if held on target long enough, Martin said.*

Pictures look like this [OXlaser OX-BX1 Gatling Style TRUE 445nm 2.2W Burning blue laser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5-YoIXSZ0A)

I'm hopeful that ""third-degree burn"" is a mis-statement.  Burns are categorized starting from first, which is general redness and no blisters to fourth.  Third degree burns extend the full thickness of the skin and require months to heal/leave scars.  The burn severity scale is inverted compared how they rank criminal charges/DEFCON status where 1 = really bad.

EDIT:  Looks like the [seattletimes](http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/transportation/2-ferry-workers-injured-by-laser-fired-into-boat-near-mukilteo/) has posted a correction/done additional ""reporting"" on the degree of the burn that results in less certainty on the severity.

*Information in this article, originally published Oct. 29, 2015, was clarified Oct. 29, 2015.  A previous version of this story said, based on information from the WSF spokesman, that an employee suffered third-degree burns to his eye lid.

"For almost 50 years now, Seattleites like you have [voted down](http://seattlish.com/post/83663717975/on-blast-90-years-of-fucked-up-seattle-public) any efforts to make modern, functional, forwarding thinking programs to create transit and better transit infrastructure. Your time of negligence and regressive policies has long since passed.

* In 1968, voters approved the Kingdome, but rejected transit  

* In [1970](http://www.seattletimes.com/business/economy/the-mass-transit-system-seattle-might-have-had-jon-talton/), voters rejected four transit-related bonds, causing the federal government to reroute transit aid to Atlanta instead of here.  

* In [1972](http://metro.kingcounty.gov/am/history/history-1970.html) voters allow a small transit tax for busses, but reject the tax for electric rail. (Even the meager vote for busses was the first time Seattleites approved new taxes for transit since 1918)  

* In [1995](http://metro.kingcounty.gov/am/history/history-1990.html), voters reject a Regional Transit Authority (later Sound Transit) measure for a gigantic, $6.7 billion transportation system over three counties that would’ve featured commuter rail, light rail, express buses, and expanded HOV lanes 

* In 1999, with Initiative 695, local voters show their love of Tim Eyman and regressivism- scrapping the progressive car excise fee for a super-regressive $30 state car tabs. Since 29% of the vehicle excise tax went to local transit, local communities have been scrambling to keep their buses running ever since. 

* In 2002, voters showed their hatred of forward-thinking transit/infrastructure funding and support an Eyman initiative yet again: voters approved I-776,which restricted local governments from adding their own excise taxes and limited local license tab fees. While the measure was shot down at first for being unconstitutional, it was upheld by the State Supreme Court in October 2003. 776 repealed many taxes that the public had [already voted on](https://researchcouncil.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/initiative776.pdf)  

* In [2005](http://www.seattlepi.com/local/transportation/article/Monorail-will-go-to-voters-for-5th-time-1183631.php), Mayor Nickels gets the ""all-or-nothing"" plan for a West Seattle-Ballard monorail on the ballot. The plan is a watered down, poor version of the original, so it failed. Its rejection gutted Seattle Monorail Partners, which had been working to upgrade our transit system since they were created by a public vote in 1997. Council President Jan Drago (accurately) expressed fear that not building the monorail segment means ""we will pass it to future generations."" **Now look where we are!** 

* In [2011](http://seattlest.com/2011/07/13/last_night_people_are_voting_with_t.php): The Congestion Reduction Fee. When our regressive and outdated sales tax revenue plummets during the recession – the King County Council approves a $20 fee on vehicle tabs to make up the $60 million deficit, collected in 2012  through 2014  

* In [2014](http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/with-transit-money-approved-seattle-pledges-to-spend-new-dollars-well/), Seattleites vote *FOR* maintaining some bus transit, with more regressive taxes - a $60 car-tab fee and a 0.1 percent sales-tax increase - to keep many bus lines from being cut and to expand services on a couple bus lines.

"&gt; a.) The increase goes into effect well before Move Seattle would and also a week before the votes are even tallied, so he's proactively raising rents with literally no idea of whether or not his taxes WILL go up. He's literally just doing it to scare people.
    
Laws of supply and demand at play, if you want cheap rent don't live on Capitol Hill.  Yes, it's a scare tactic but giant property tax increases are certainly a thing in Seattle. Like I said this is likely the 8th property tax increase in 5 years everything from pre-school to mass transit are funded by property taxes.    
    
&gt;  b.) Regardless of the potential tax increases the owner of the property might see if Move Seattle does go through (which, again, we won't even 100% for sure know for several weeks due to vote-by-mail), a landlord can't threaten to or actively increase rents as a punitive measure for tenants exercising their right to vote.    
    
They can vote whatever way they want, like you said rent is going up regardless.    
    
&gt; That's kind of a basic part of democracy and also pretty clear in landlord/tenant right laws.

"Mmmm. I looked and thought a lot about the Craftsman revolution as a reaction to the Victorian establishment, and I think that the voice they are amplifying to some degree are Victorians who like gardens of symmetry, bespoke and ornate details on the outside, etc.


Craftsman are all about the inside. They are the nerdy library girl to the ""painted lady"" of a Victorian of the era. My craftsman house is built of good wood, but it's chimney is made of rough and strange bricks, called Klinker Bricks. These were the cast offs from rebuilding downtown after The Great Fire. Remember the downtown burned down and was regraded too. Those workers have to live somewhere.


In a coal fired brick furnace, some of the bricks, used to rebuild downtown, on the outside of the pile would get too hot and change color and shape, oozing out and going all lava in some spots. These were trash that someone took care and made into a thing because Victorian houses with symmetry couldn't deal with it. I'd also like to think that the workers who were working on Victorian houses on the hill would take offcuts home and fix up their own houses. I feel the Craftsman movement is very much in line with the Maker movement. Maybe they couldn't afford a victorian so they made what they wanted with what they had at hand, using offcuts and waste products from the rest of the boom. I often think this at least when I dumpster dive on yet another garage under condo monster to get perfectly good bits of Styrofoam insulation, racks of nails, or modern insulated low e windows, just tossed away.


The floor plan of a Craftsman is also from an era where the woman of the household did not have live in servant help, but was also not.. isolated from the house. From almost anywhere in the house you can see all the other parts of the house with a few steps. Hence you can do something and still keep an eye on a little one. Victorian houses, you have doors to isolate rooms for discretion, and, being much bigger, you have parlors for entertaining. Dedicated rooms and then other dedicated rooms for other things. And if you go later, into the post war, you see layouts where dad is watching the game on TV, and mom is working hard in an isolated area of the kitchen.


The craftsmans of 1900 to 1910 are a lot different than those of the 1920s as well. Culturally a lot happened from 1900 to 1920. Like cars, planes and a war! A huge amount of Seattle was built out by 1915 as well. To say in the article that the ""suburbs"" were tasteless is a bit false. We had street cars that ran to Green Lake! They might have been called that by the big shots living on the hills in bespoke Victorians though. They probably weren't invited inside to read a book next to a cozy tiny fireplace with wood built ins whilst they could keep track of the little one playing whilst dad was fishing. And he had probably walked to the boat. Tasteless only if you aren't allowed access to taste. 


Now which culture do we want to be apart of in a modern era..?. Do we want to have huge rooms with isolated areas and discreet conversations? Do we want postwar woman in the kitchen floor plans? Or do we want a floor plan where it's pretty hard to be hidden from sight whilst doing some other activity. I know I could never afford anything more modern than this, where social reforms took place and made a more ""open floorplan"". I went back in time to another generation who also couldn't afford fancy and made an ""open floorplan"" out of necessity.


I would be hard pressed to amplify the dissenting opinions on craftsmans being a blight. That would like looking back and saying that the NIMBYS of Mercer had some things right when they said we needed more lanes on a freeway, when in reality people were also struggling to create light rail.

They were spray painting on the post office wall. A federal building. In the middle of the day. Even after a meter maid rolled up and told them to stop. I asked them how they feel about the sign. Jamie joked, ""It's unfortunate because most homeless people around here aren't even tweakers.... they're junkies.""

"**Jon Grant** Thank you for asking, this is often an topic the landlord industry obfuscates. I spelled out my specific proposal at www.newdirectionseattle.org, or you can read in greater detail [here](https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/newdirectionseattle/pages/1/attachments/original/1436814235/Housing_Platform_Final.pdf?1436814235)

I propose rents to be tied to inflation, while allowing for additional rent increases to offset costs for capital improvements, increases in utilities and property taxes, and other legitimate costs on the landlord. Los Angeles has one of the best rent regulation policies, known as a Rent Stabilization Ordinance (RSO), that follows this model. The city did the most comprehensive market and economic analysis ever conducted (over 400 pages long) on it's own RSO policy to determine if there were any harms to the housing market, and in fact found that not only were there no harm to the quality or quantity of their private housing stock without it there would be nowhere for low income and even many middle class families who rent to live. This [article has a link](http://www.thestranger.com/blogs/slog/2015/07/21/22580000/disappointed-by-the-rent-control-debate-heres-what-a-six-year-old-400-page-study-on-rent-stabilization-says) to that study.

There are over 200 municipalities across the country that have some form of rent regulation. Landlords often point to a system of ""capping"" rents or putting a ceiling on rents as the example of how not to do it. And I agree with them, rents should not be capped. In fact, this is a boogey man put out by the industry because in fact there is no jurisdiction that caps rents in this fashion. During World War I the government did impose rent caps but that was phased out over a 100 years ago. Kshama Sawant isn't even proposing rent caps, but a similar model to Los Angeles.

The other arguments is that we should have tax credits or subsidies to address our affordable housing problem, but keep in mind currently there are only about 32,000 units rent restricted in this way but there are over 300,000 tenants in Seattle. Rent regulation - reasonably crafted - is the only policy that brings affordability to scale.

In the mean time, we are going to watch as developers and landlords are given free reign to price gouge and double people's rents, which we sadly continue to hear stories of day after day.",,,,SeattleCityCouncilP8,,,1444333590,t5_2qhad,t3_3nzeg3,t1_cvslrtn,22,1446850806,0,0,cvsupgz,Seattle,22,,

"COPY/PASTE 


OLYMPIA — The federal government has denied Washington state an extension from complying with tougher federal requirements that require proof of legal U.S. residency in order for state driver’s licenses and IDs to be valid for federal purposes, including, eventually, boarding commercial aircraft.

A letter from the Department of Homeland Security, obtained by The Associated Press on Wednesday, was sent Monday to the state Department of Licensing notifying the agency of the decision.





The department said the state will be given a three-month grace period before its current temporary extension, issued earlier this year, expires. During that time, federal agencies can continue to accept driver’s licenses and identification cards issued by Washington for official purposes.
 

Washington state already offers enhanced driver’s licenses and IDs that require proof of U.S. citizenship and are valid under the federal law. The state’s enhanced driver’s license or ID card costs more than the standard issue and requires presentation of proof of citizenship, such as an original birth certificate or a naturalization certificate. Standard Washington licenses or ID cards can be upgraded to enhanced status for a calibrated fee of $3 per year remaining on your current license or ID card. The other option for flying is to present a U.S. passport, which costs more than a state ID and can take up to five weeks to obtain.


In January, the federal government had granted the state an extension through Oct. 10 after state officials proposed a plan to the Legislature that would create a two-tiered licensing system that would keep the current enhanced license but would also create a standard state license that would indicate it is not valid for federal purposes.

But that measure never gained traction, and the Legislature adjourned in July without passing anything related to REAL ID.

“Although DHS recognizes the State of Washington’s efforts in enhancing the security of its driver’s licenses and identification cards, Washington has not provided adequate justification for continued noncompliance that would warrant granting your request of another extension,” the letter states.

The federal REAL ID Act, passed in 2005, requires proof of U.S. citizenship or proof of lawful status in the U.S. in order for a license to be valid for federal use.

People without valid federal IDs might eventually need a passport or have to go through other screening processes in order to travel domestically or enter federal buildings.

The law has had several implementation delays but access to some federal facilities is now restricted without an enhanced ID. As early as next year, such ID could be required to board commercial aircraft, though the federal government hasn’t given a firm timeline on access to flights. Earlier this month, the Department of Homeland Security said it would announce a date on travel requirements by the end of the year.





Tony Sermonti, legislative director for the state Department of Licensing, said there’s frustration with the Department of Homeland Security because “the goal line keeps moving.”


“On the fundamental pieces, there’s a lack of clarity from the federal government around what and when the portions of REAL ID act will be enforced,” he said.

Since 2007, more than 500,000 Washington residents have gotten an enhanced driver’s license or enhanced ID card. There are about 5.4 million people with standard licenses, and about 600,000 with regular ID cards.

There are many states and territories that haven’t fulfilled the national ID law’s mandates but have received extensions, Sermonti said.
 

Washington and New Mexico are the only states that do not require proof of legal presence in the U.S. to get a state license or ID. Other states give restricted licenses to people who can’t prove they are in the U.S. legally. New Mexico also had its request for an extension denied.

Republican Sen. Curtis King, chairman of the Senate Transportation Committee, said that lawmakers will try to address the issue again when the next legislative session begins in January.





“We don’t have a choice,” he said. “The choice has been taken out of our hands.”

"I was trying to remember what it was that Murry did that I really didn’t agree with, and then I remembered it. In 2013 he was caught trying to include language in a gun control bill that would give the police the right to search the home of anyone who owned a rifle, once a year with no warrant, failure to comply would get you a year in jail. Once this was discovered ( by Lance Palmer, a Seattle trial lawyer and self-described liberal  ) and the times ran with the story Murry claimed it was a “clerical error”, A “clerical error” he made three times in the last six years.



I don’t care what side of the gun control argument you fall on, trying to sneak in shit like warrantless police searches and then call it an error when you’re caught is some seriously shady shit. I think we have enough shady characters in congress as it is.

Our over-reliance on sales taxes has been shown to lead to [declining state tax revenues](http://www.king5.com/story/news/local/2014/09/15/washington-sales-tax-wealth-gap/15658825/) and increasing income [inequality](http://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2024548711_taxreportxml.html), with an inequitable distribution of funding for public goods like public schools and services. Case in point:

&gt; 22 percent of Seattle’s families chose private schools in the 2011-2012 school year

We have underfunded public schools, so education outcomes fall, and as those with the means to do so choose private schools, inequality increases. More thanks to Seattle's regressive fiscal policies.

"Never heard of this dude but it is a bit hypocritical of him to be making this art, but let's be honest with ourselves, tech workers far out number smug new artists.  I think as long as we don't become downtown Bellevue, everything should be cool.  And it has less to do with money I think, and more to do with like 2-3 construction companies creating the same thing with different shades of paint. 

I had offices at the WeWork building last summer and walking around SLU really felt like an extension of Bellevue.  Which while is clean and pretty, feels really sterile and dead past 8pm.  It's not that tech workers are boring, it's that the people who construct these things assume the worst of tech workers.  

Like downtown Bellevue wouldn't be bad, but it's the landlord who can suck it, for example three or so years ago there was a halfway decent club at glass crossing thing connecting the two malls, one shooting and goodbye all night life.  This same thing happened at Pacific Place, the building is owned by the same person who owns the Bellevue mall, there used to be a club on the top level called Pink.  Shit was a blast.  But alas that lasted a whole year because noise complaints.  Noise complaints from who?  Who fucking knows the place opened two hours after all the other stores closed and there is no residential spots within two or three blocks of the place, besides it was on the top floor so it's not like the noise traveled.  And it was gang run so there was never any violence.

"&gt; of course even then people will find a way to live where they want if they have lots of money...just look at NYC.

That's not really what happened. Well, kind of, but it's not the full story. What's happened is that the people who were lucky enough to be living in rent-controlled apartments (they weren't necessarily rich, just lucky to be renting at that time) realized they had an amazing deal with rent regulations and have no reason to ever give up their apartments. 

So they stay forever, with rents far under real market rates, passing on the apartments to friends or family. With the regulated apartments out of the market, people looking for housing are fighting over what's left. And when a large amount of the market is under price regulation, the rest of the housing is just going to skyrocket because demand is so much greater than supply.

I often just walk my bike on heavily populated blocks of downtown because you aren't going to get there any faster by riding and have a much higher potential of losing balance and crashing.

"This question kind of begins with a false dichotomy: That people either chose micro housing or shared housing, and that those choices are largely equal, save for personal preferences. However, that's not the case; largely, people don't just have the choice between one or the other, due to the existing housing stock and the rental market.

The truth is that there is much less housing which can be shared—multi-bedroom, single-family housing—available to renters. There's been a micro housing (and studio, and one-bedroom) boom in the last five years, while the construction of shareable homes and apartments has all but stalled. Very few developers are building apartments that have two or more bedrooms, and the stock of actual stand-alone houses that have numerous bedrooms and are rentals has decreased, not increased. As a result, families are being pushed out of the city, and more people are choosing to live alone (per the 2010 Census, about 43% of people in Seattle live alone, and that number is increasing year over year, despite rental increases). It's arguably better that way; when non-families use this existing housing stock instead of living separately, it buts an additional burden on family units looking to rent in the city in an already-diminished market.

Additionally, though (as you said in another comment), micro housing is cropping up in all kinds of neighborhoods, for the most part, it's much more centralized, and serves a completely different lifestyle than homes with multiple bedrooms. And finally, micro housing is often less expensive, overall, than shared housing; market rate for a two-bedroom in Seattle was estimated to be $2,136 in August of this year. Split two ways, that's $1,068 each. And while it is POSSIBLE to find a place that's less expensive to split, an aPodment (with a private bathroom, mini-fridge, microwave, locking door, etc) or even a studio is still typically around that same price or less (market rate for a studio is hard to quantify because there's not a lot of data there, weirdly, but it's around $1100; an aPodment will run you closer to $900).

"It's definitely possible but I most certainly wouldn't do it via I-90. While the interstates are obviously well traveled and plowed etc, it's still going to be very risky - I once contemplated driving from here to OKC at Christmas a few years back, my research basically concluded that I'd probably die somewhere in Nebraska (if I even got that far).

If you want to do it, I'd say take I-80/84, that's the furthest north I'd risk - even then it's still going to be tough - although we are supposedly in for a milder winter so you may luck out. The ""safest"" way is I-76/70/44 via Indy to OKC, then blast out west on I-40 to LA and up I-5. But even then the stretches of I-40 through New Mexico can be particularly bad in the winter and the CA/OR boarder area is also dicey sometimes and it's a much longer route.

"It's not hard to pick up Giardia, fecal coloform, crypto from unfiltered water or water coming in contact with surfaces that are not food-clean. This is the primary gross. Blasting them with UV filters can cut them down to size pretty effectively.

There is also a lot of diesel emissions and aerosols which have a lot of nasties that aren't super wonderful to eat. Rainwater usually forms a drop around dust. If the dust is flyash or soot from a diesel cargo ship then that is full of gross things you don't want in you. This is my secondary gross. 

Composite shingles have a lot of tar and other petrochemicals that aren't really super healthy either. Obviously if you have a metal roof you are less exposed. 

A lot of people use a ""first flush"" system which diverts the first bit of water off a roof which has the most amount of birdshit and dust / dirt / flyash. Then the water after that is filtered and processed.

As much as we don't have coal fired power plants around here ( except like Centralia ), we do get pollution from around the world (China). Obviously local sources are much stronger, and the Pacific filters a lot, but to say we are isolated is somewhat untrue. Wildfire sources make the pollution obvious since its visable and you maybe saw how far the smoke will travel.

"&gt;I know that landlords take a $45 application fee from multiple people and just keep the fee and tell them they're not approved so I'm a little concerned about the process.

No, we do not 'just keep the fee', that money does not just go into our pockets.  We run a credit check which costs money.  We do a back ground check which takes time.  The reason we do this is because lots of people lie on applications and we need to be safe on our investment.  Not only do we not make money on the application process but we work lots of hours for free trying to find good people so please don't waste our time.

As a landlord, I'm looking not just at income but at stability.  Your income level looks fine, your credit history is maybe a little flaky but not a red flag for me.  But realize who you are probably going up against in this rental market.  Why would I want to rent to three people who may or may not work as a cohesive group and evidently don't even know each other well enough to know each others credit scores?  When I could rent to a nice stable couple that has been together for years and is just looking for a 3 bedroom because they need a home office?

I guess I'm unusual in that I'm willing to take less in rent for a trade off of stability, but I don't want to be going through this whole process again a year from now because one of your room mates decided to go to grad school in a different state.  This is a different story when you are working with a rental agency (and exactly why I don't use a rental agency) they will be looking for someone that can fulfill a years lease (or whatever their terms are) and they actually make money finding tenants so they don't care if you move on in a year.

"I'm very grateful PCC exists.  It is too damn hard to sort through everything and find the best food available in every season -- PCC does the legwork.  I am lucky I can afford organic pastured-chicken eggs, grass-fed beef, humanely raised pork, organic apples and peppers, and veggies that taste AWESOME. I am SO glad that someone is sourcing the best quality, most ethical food available.  That is an amazing service.  I am happy to pay for it.

What bothers me most is the antagonism people have toward PCC.  It's not like I run around telling everyone they are idiots for shopping at QFC or Safeway.  But somehow, people seem to think that that's assumed -- because I make a different choice, I must be judging them, therefore they have to tell me what a fucking idiot I am for shopping at PCC.   Just the EXISTENCE of the store raises hackles.  Just reusing a paper bag from there makes people grumble.  The same people that squeal when someone has a $400 pair of shoes -- something that baffles me -- get angry that PCC exists and costs more than Safeway.  It's completely acceptable to bitch about PCC; completely NOT acceptable to bitch about Jimmy Choo's existence.  That's just fashion, and people who care about fashion should have a right to their shoes!  Um... but people that care about their food, apparently, shouldn't have a right to PCC?

I really hate it.  I wish people would stop thinking that simply having a place like PCC that exists, that obtains and makes available food with the qualities I prefer, that has philosophies I mostly agree with, is somehow an indictment of other choices.  I am about to need a tinfoil hat, because I am thinking that anti-""clean"" or anti-""ethical"" feeling is possibly deliberately fomented by those who wish to either distract or to force people into a single choice- either for maintaining power or profit.  But I don't have any non-GMO aluminum foil handy, so I can't make a hat.  It's all a distraction, anyway.

I don't tell people they are stupid for shopping at Safeway. I don't care who shops at QFC.  It does surprise me, when I go into QFC, just how little of their offerings I actually recognize as ""food"" anymore.  Most of my food is vegetable with meat, now, and doesn't come in a box.  That is a change in the last few years, and I am personally quite objectively much healthier for it.  But it is hard, and it is a choice, and it is my choice alone.  It's frustrating that others feel the need to tear it down, when it is so good for me.  

As far as GMOs go -- far as I am concerned, until we have science and journalism that is not bought and sold by the likes of Monsanto, the jury is out.  There IS no jury.  Evidence points to Monsanto being effectively Satan. Monsanto wants us all to eat their particular brand of soy and corn.  Their corporate persona alone is enough to turn me off.  Perhaps the food is entirely safe, perhaps we're not throwing away diversity we utterly need (I'm an avid gardener, and I'm appalled at what they've done buying up seed companies and eliminating strains and choices we used to have), perhaps they're doing more good than harm. Might be!  But there's no way to know, because they've poisoned the political and scientific wells.  There's no objective source of sufficient information.

I've done a lot of reading.  I've done a lot of food-growing.  I have dozens and dozens of books about growing plants, including foods, in the PNW.  I have many about pesticide and herbicide use.  I've had my plants decimated by slugs and bugs. I am not unfamiliar with agriculture.  I've also seen serious disease disappear when chucking the party line - an extremely unpopular move - and switching the ""worst"" pesticide-laden foods (the well-known dirty dozen) for organic, meats for mostly grass-fed, and eventually cutting way back on grains and sugars. Conventional knowledge, handed to us by advertisers, is *wrong*.  Unfortunately, we can't say what's right, because we can't study it without corporate sponsors.

I just wonder how many generations of us will be fat, and sick, and tired all the time because of the massive pressure to conform and eat the food we are ""supposed"" to eat - corn and soy.  I wonder how long it will be legal for me to save my seeds -- heirloom varieties are being bought, unbelievably, even patented, and licensed.   I wonder how long it will be legal for a co-op like PCC to exist, or feasible for people to choose to shop at without landing on some list.  (Dammit, gotta stop there until I get my hat.)

Even if PCC is wrong, I am glad they exist.  Even if I couldn't afford to shop there, I'd be glad they exist.  They are doing the best work they can from a point of view that is not directed by corporate money. They are not harming anyone by existing.  They are providing an alternative many of us find beneficial.  They are learning how to scale. They are teaching people to cook. They are exposing people to vegetables and flavors they wouldn't have known otherwise. They have an amazing deli that provides delicious food quickly.  They cost too much.  So does Nordstrom's, so I don't shop there anymore - I don't get enough benefit from their quality or service to justify the cost.  But people don't generally rant that Nordy's exists.  They don't say that people who shop their are misguided morons who don't understand science.  ",,,,ThrowawaySeattlite,,,1444628402,t5_2qhad,t3_3odx0n,t3_3odx0n,12,1446916588,0,0,cvwnucu,Seattle,12,,

"Very well described. I live in Lower Queen Anne, near Streamline. There have been a handful of homeless in the area for years now, three I know particularly well. 

About the time of Hemp Fest and Folk Life every year, I notice an influx of homeless and indigents. Usually it subsides about a month later. This year, though, it's not only maintained, but increased. 

I know that there's a tenuous connection between those events and the homeless population, but it's a correlation I've noticed over the last few years. Counterbalance Park, the UPS Store, the yard in front of the retirement community, On The Boards stairwell, and a few other places where I tend to walk regularly are occupied by sleepers and drinkers.

A new homeless center will be installed on Roy Street across from the Streamline soon. The homeless camp in Ballard will be next to a liquor store and a bar. *I don't think the city is thinking this through.*

The fix is not to create camps. The fix is to provide true shelter for those who need it, and true help to those who want it. Stopgap measures like a shower once a week or a few tepid meals are only going to perpetuate the current state of affairs. 

To fix this, there needs to be bridge over the troubled water, not stepping stones through a raging river.

"Should bikes be allowed to do a rolling stop? Yes. Here's why... (and in the interests of full disclosure, I am NOT a bicycle commuter, I do not own any spandex biking gear, and when I ride, it is usually on bike trails, not on the road.)
If you ride a street bike, and / or you ride more than casually, you probably have what are called ""clips"". These are special pedals / shoes that mechanically couple, so you can provide power to the pedals on both the down stroke, AND the up stroke of your pedaling. This makes travel MUCH more efficient, and makes hills easier to climb. Getting your feet into and out of the clips can sometimes be a bit of a pain in the ass, and if you needed to do it every...single...block for a mile or two, it would be daunting. If, as a bicyclist, you reach a 4 way stop, and can see that there is no traffic, a ""rolling stop"" should be acceptable. What should NOT be acceptable is a ""fuck it, I'm a bike DING DING"" right-of-way grab. 

So, also in the interests of full disclosure, I DO ride a motorcycle. There are a number of similarities between the perception of bicyclists, and motorcycle riders. The main thing is that a small percentage of dickwads create a bad name for all of us. The douchebag bicyclist who cusses out cars because of some imagined slight, or the spandex-clad ""racer"" who insists on sitting in the middle of the lane, while going 15MPH give all bicycle riders a bad name the same way that a squid on a sport bike doing wheelies at 110mph, or a wannabe outlaw biker give motorcycle riders a bad name. People only remember the BAD. So, if bicyclists want to be taken seriously, and viewed in a positive light, they need to self-regulate, and beat some sense into their douchey brethren.

"&gt; Being a bigger city and a transport hub also makes us a more likely spot for an asshole to reside in; presumably availability of drugs is higher here than in any suburb.

You're probably right and that's why I think we should be separating the two.  Prosecute the nitwits and demonstrate that we, as residents of the city, won't stand for this shit.  Of course, I understand that there is a bit of a trust issue with our police at the moment, but this isn't an insurmountable goal.  Other cities manage to do it.

&gt; Seattle employs fewer police per capita than nearly every city in the area.

I'm not seeing what you are seeing from that link.  It seems like Seattle has more police per 10,000 residents (as of 2012) than any other city I could think to search:

- Seattle: 20.6 per 10k

And then:

- Redmond: 14.2
- Bellevue: 13.5
- Kirkland: 18.9
- Everett: 18.3
- Tacoma: 17.4

"It really is disheartening that the state can't even provide an accurate list of dentists who accept apple health.  I called down the list a couple years ago when my kids were inexplicably put on apple health for kids.  I must've called 15 dentists who are on the list, none of whom accept it and many of whom also expressed intense frustration over the fact that they have tried and tried to be removed from the list to no avail.

When I finally found one, they kind of sucked and the following year, when our whole insurance situation got tossed on its head again, we switched.

I suspect the problem lies with the reimbursement rates.  They are about 50% of market rates.  You can get the current Medicaid (Apple Health) rates here: http://www.hca.wa.gov/medicaid/rbrvs/pages/index.aspx

D1110 is the basic cleaning code (prophylaxis) and my insurer pays $73.60 where Medicaid pays $34.38

D0120 which is the basic ""evaluation"" code used during a routine visit pays $37.82 with private insurance and $20.24 under Medicaid.

"**Jon:** I think we need to encourage density in a thoughtful way, and my big concern with blanket changes to single family zones was the likely displacement that would follow of low-income renters who live in houses. Single family homes are actually one of the biggest contingent of our private rental market, I used to live in such a house with 10 roommates and paid $600 a month in rent. My landlord at the time owned 6 other houses he rented out in the neighborhood. A blanket change to the zoning code would trigger a sell off of these rental properties to make condos and other forms of housing stock that would never be affordable to the renters who used to live in those houses. Not to mention this is one of the few sources of family size housing, which we are in a critical shortage of; less that 1% of 3-bedroom apartments are affordable to someone earning 80% of the Area Median Income.

"**Jon:** Voters have a real choice in this race to reject the notion that elections can be bought; because that is what is happening  in Seattle City Council Position 8. All together there will be over **half a million** dollars spent to re-elect my opponent, much of it in negative attack ads. I have taken a pledge not to accept any contributions from downtown developers, CEO's, or other Chamber of Commerce interests so voters know I stand with them.

Furthermore, we must pass Honest Election Initiative 122 and bring about a new era of campaign finance reform. My opponent used his procedural power as Council President to block a campaign finance reform bill last year, and only a few weeks ago after intense pressure from my campaign came out in support of the Honest Elections initiative.

Where your campaign money comes from matters as it often determines policy outcomes. It's why we constantly rely on regressive tax levy's to pay for infrastructure instead of an employee hours tax paid by the private sector, why reasonable rent regulation policies are demonized and our housing costs spiral, and why for decades we have not had real reform for police accountability. We have an opportunity to reject the influence of unbridled money in our elections and candidates, and its about time for a true change.",,,,SeattleCityCouncilP8,,,1444335611,t5_2qhad,t3_3nzeg3,t1_cvsqmwt,12,1446851474,0,0,cvsw4jp,Seattle,12,,

"My wife and I and our 8 year old are living on about the same amount of total household income.

You are not going to find a house for $1,350 anywhere in Seattle city limits (at least not one that you're going to want to live in). You *may* be able to find a 2 bedroom apartment for that rent, but even that's probably optimistic at the moment. Rents are way up since we moved to Seattle in 2010. You should expect to pay $1,500 - $2,000 a month for a 2 bedroom apartment depending on the neighborhood and the quality of the building, BUT - really look around. I know there are places in West Seattle that are still around that range, and likely in North Seattle too, north of 85th Ave. 

Full-time day care for a 1 year old is most likely going to run into the $1,000 - $1,200 a month range. This gets a little more reasonable as your child gets older, and there are pre-school options that offer some value. The City of Seattle actually funds some early childhood education (assuming you live in the city limits) and the income threshold for qualifying is quite high. Worth checking out when your kiddo gets a little older. http://www.seattle.gov/education/child-care-and-preschool/step-ahead

There's no income tax in Washington State; there is however sales tax on everything except food, and that adds up. In Seattle I believe the tax is 9.5%. It varies a little in other cities, but if you roughly figure 10% of every non-food dollar, you'll be about there.

You would be in trouble if your wife lost her job or decided not to work. 45k is not going to cut it for a family; you could do it, but forget saving or being comfortable. Although, if you're wife could stay home with the kiddo, that would cut the childcare expense, Still would be tough at that income level though. Seattle isn't quite San Francisco yet, but we're getting there. It's an expensive city to live in. ",,,,kottonkrown,,,1445766113,t5_2qhad,t3_3q4olx,t3_3q4olx,15,1447182850,0,0,cwc1c2c,Seattle,15,,

"Unfamiliar with modern agriculture causes pesticide concerns?  More like you're unfamiliar with the data showing pesticides are extremely unhealthful.  Allow me to change that.

Most people don't understand just how problematic synthetic pesticides are not just for the environment and farm workers, but our entire society.  Did you know that one of the most popular families of pesticides used in conventional agriculture, organophosphates, has been widely implicated in severe developmental neurotoxicity issues in children?  As these studies showcase, these pesticides, found in normal amounts in children, not children with high exposure, are implicated in reduced IQ and cognitive abilities:

- http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21507778
- http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21507776
- http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/1003160/
- http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2010/05/17/peds.2009-3058.full.pdf+html
- http://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/publish/news/newsroom/8978
- http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26057254

Take a few minutes to ponder the ramifications; the food we eat may literally be making us dumber.  And yes, food is a major pesticide source despite what industry might claim: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18414640 and http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/1408197/.  Continuing on, the most important enzyme responsible for breaking down these pesticides in the human body is called serum paraoxanase.  Some people have a lot of paraoxanase activity and are able to break down the pesticides really fast.  Guess which subpopulation scientists are beginning to find has significantly reduced paraoxanase activity?  People with autism: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16297937 -- and this year a large study found associations between organophosphates and autism: http://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/publish/news/newsroom/8978.  More work needs to be done on this front, but the early findings are concerning to say the least.

The data against organophosphates continues to pile up and has resulted in the thousands of scientists represented by the Union of Concerned Scientists wanting organophosphates banned.  Unfortunately, politics wins at the EPA: http://www.ucsusa.org/our-work/center-science-and-democracy/promoting-scientific-integrity/epa-and-pesticides.html

I only spoke of the neurotoxicity issues above.  Make no mistake, these pesticides cause harm across a variety of spectrums.  Not just on children's nervous systems but everything from gestation duration and birthweight to lower sperm count in humans to changing the behavior of bugs.  Some example studies:

- http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/1104615/
- http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25413219
- http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2015/03/pesticides-result-in-lower-sperm-counts/

There will be a time when society looks back in shame on its use of synthetic pesticides.  But make no mistake, the greed of chemical manufacturers and the cognitive dissonance of those who utilize these pesticides will result in unquantifiable damage before we get to that point.  Educate yourself and do what you can to protect your family in the meantime.  ",,,,TheYogi,,,1444617295,t5_2qhad,t3_3odx0n,t3_3odx0n,15,1446914109,1,0,cvwikzu,Seattle,15,,
"...unless he's doing it in a way that coerces or intimidates his players into joining him.  He might not mean to be doing that, but if a player could feel like he'd better join in and pray so as not to piss off the coach, or be the odd man out on the team, then that's a form of coercion.

People in positions of authority (coaches, teachers, clergy, bosses, etc.) have to watch that.  Even if their intentions are good and pure, and they know they'd never retaliate against someone junior to them who says no, that person in the less-powerful position just can't be certain of that.

The coach can pray, without his students, when and where he chooses.  The students on the team can do likewise.  But a coach in a public school can't lead or join the students in a religious observance at a school-sanctioned event without violating the Establishment Clause of the Constitution--the courts have been pretty clear about that.

What do teams do to prepare for this? Does the company set things up so there's always shared responsibility/no single critical person?

Is every single case handled separately? Because that's impossible to scale in large companies, discretion has to be removed or else it gets capricious by group and manager. Sales can leave but ops can't etc.

I guess it's a legit answer for some to say ""it doesn't matter stop asking questions"" but I'm really curious is there a way the company can systematically reduce the disruption this would cause, and realistically have career continuity for the employee when they return?

"In essence, what a price cap does is create a black market for that good at a higher price. In New York, for instance, some tenants of rent controlled units haven't actually lived in their unit for years. Instead, they sublet the units to housing seekers at market rates. Suppose you pay $700 a month for rent and new apartments are leasing for $2800. You move out and find a discrete subletter who will pay you $2500 a month and then pocket the difference.

I've said before and will say again: the problem we're facing is too many people and not enough housing. The only possible way to fix that problem is to either provide more housing or have fewer people. Over time, the market will drive those least able to pay out of the city, thereby executing the latter option. If you think that is a bad thing, we should probably work on providing more housing.

"This is a psychology question.

Look into the surprising effectiveness of those ""Your Speed Is"" signs. Perhaps you've seen them? They post your current speed below a sign that posts the maximum speed. If you exceed the maximum posted speed, sometimes they light up and flash.

These signs don't provide any more information. A driver already knows how fast he's driving. They do, however, provide immediate and public feedback. With two sources of information, especially when one source is perceived as distinct from the car / driver combo, drivers tend to break out of their sense of exceptionalism and comply. Also, the second source of information is public! The psychological desire to conform overcomes the perceived notion that limits apply to others.

Red-light cameras and speed-trap cameras are reviled because they don't work. They're designed to take advantage of our these well-understood traits by removing the immediate, secondary, and public feedback loops. We get tickets weeks after the offense! They come in the mail! We can't face our accuser to explain how the rules shouldn't apply to us!

They also represent a fundamental misunderstanding of why people speed and why they obey the law. A camera says ""people only obey the laws when someone watches, so we'll watch all of the time."" They say ""the only consequence people concern themselves with is monetary fines.""

Speeding and distracted driving are pretty well-understood psychological desires that can easily be overcome. Instead, we encourage them then use them as excuses to generate revenue. No wonder people distrust cameras.",,,,harlottesometimes,,,1445267399,t5_2qhad,t3_3pcvh7,t1_cw569a6,23,1447063669,0,0,cw577w7,Seattle,23,,

"I agree with you.

I understand that people fall into terrible circumstances, however that's not an explanation for ""yeah it's totally okay to just trash this whole area."" 

Your response to that may be, ""they're mentally ill."" Which is valid. It has been my experience however, that the access to services for unfortunate individuals is not as limited as you may think. I worked for HopeLink for many many years - and the statistics say that, including shelters and other services that are available, public assistance is under utilized. The first-hand experience I had has jaded me to the fact that there is *plenty* of resources available, it's just that a large number of these individuals actively decide not to use the services, and would rather trash a neighborhood than get help. Sure, that sounds like a ""heartless republican view,"" but it's coming from someone who worked for 5 years *directly* with the homeless (I cooked them food, I helped them assemble their tents, I washed their sleeping bags - only once did I hear a ""thank you"", in 5 years).",,,,ProfWhite,Kirkland,,1444288428,t5_2qhad,t3_3nwn01,t1_cvs6om7,17,1446840565,0,0,cvs99u0,Seattle,17,,flair

"On KIRo this morning, they interviewed the mom of a kid who is still in ICU with a broken neck, proclaiming that her kids ""are not quitters"" and she knew it was serious when he wouldn't go back into play.

The coach said that the problem is that they depend on the kids to self-report how bad their injuries are. But with parents pressuring them to ""not be a quitter"" they are more inclined to not say how serious the injury is.

That's the problem.  There aren't more injuries happening, but there is more pressure from sports fanatics to keep playing regardless of the injury. That's what needs to be addressed.

No, I am sorry but you do not have to hear from the children. The children, because they _are children_ do not get a say in this.

"Seriously?

I am 57 years old.  I have worked in the same field (higher ed administration and advising, at public and private nonprofit colleges) for all my adult life.  My starting salary at my first full-time job after grad school in 1983 was $15,000 a year, no benefits--slightly [below average](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d03/tables/dt387.asp) for people graduating that year with bachelors degrees and working in public service jobs.   I know what the average twenty-something starts out at today, while the ink is still wet on their BSCS degrees (I've advised a few of them).  I currently make about half those salaries, without counting their sign-on incentives, annual bonuses, stock options, and office fridge stocked with beverages and snacks.  I have never made significantly more than this in my life, and I don't expect I will before I retire, or drop in my tracks (and the latter is more likely to come first).  That's pretty typical for the majority of people in my profession.  Obviously, I did not choose this kind of work or stay in it because of the lucrative pay.

Any more wildly inaccurate presumptions you'd care to make about me, that I can destroy for you?

Also, as I said before:  Amazon Fresh wouldn't be worth it for me.  I like to cook, and I don't mind shopping--and while I don't have much spare time, I have considerably less spare money.  Sure, it would be kind of handy sometimes, but it's just not an option in my world.

"Fascinating that this is the ONE comment that /u/WSDOT has not responded to.

Like just about everyone who uses these roads has noticed, and that the graphs in the WSDOT blog demonstrate, **congestion is worse for more hours during the day.**  The average drive time may be shorter at peak hours (because some people are paying the toll and using the express lanes) but it's considerably longer during non-peak hours. Drive time SB is 5-10 minutes longer than last year's average between 11AM and 4PM. Drive time NB is 10 minutes longer than last year's average between 5pm and 7PM, and 5 minutes longer between 12PM and 3PM.

That's NOT an improvement, WSDOT.

Also, what this data ignores is the onramp wait times that for many of us have **DOUBLED**. I want to see the average drive times that include the on-ramps at 520 to 405-NB and 405-SB, 116th to 405-SB, 85th to 405-NB and SB. Those express toll lanes have made getting on to 405 a nightmare and have backed up traffic on the surface streets.

By increasing the HOV lane occupancy limit, by reinstating the HOV lane restriction between 7PM and 5AM, and by placing a toll on two lanes, WSDOT has **DISSUADED DRIVERS FROM USING THOSE LANES** and relieving traffic elsewhere. 

WSDOT, what were you thinking?!?!

"I have had absolutely the same experience as your last paragraph.

I've lived in seattle forever, grew up in fremont. When i was a kid i used to walk around the area almost every day, and got to know a lot of the homeless people down there to the point that some of them were actually friends with me and my parents. I even got birthday presents a couple times from a guy who had a HUGE collection of old disney merch stashed somewhere. Then i lived on aurora, and in belltown. Belltown was *worse*, but it was never really bad per se. 

Moved to capitol hill nearly a decade ago, and it was basically the same routine as fremont. Several homless people who are still around know me by name. I was almost always in one of the parks or walking the street unless i was working.

I noticed it a bit last summer, but really starkly this summer and this year in general that it's a *very* different crowd, and yea, they're aggressive and violent. I live on a side street, and i can't believe the number of fist fights and screaming conflicts i've seen this year. I've also been harassed on the street quite a bit, which used to happen very rarely if at all. 

Don't really know what to say about this, or what to do, but i absolutely agree that's gotten worse and *different*.

"As a driver who regularly used the HOV lanes for their intended purpose, I WAS pissed they changed this lane on 405.

In order to continue using a lane I was already entitled to use for free, which was supposed to encourage responsible driving for the environment; now I have to pay $45 to drive in the HOV. So much for the environment.

$15 for a required plastic pass.
$30 for a required toll slush fund (so the government can do what they do best and pre-spend money)

I stomped and screamed for months as I watched them build this crap. 

I could not have been more wrong!!!!!! 

I clearly misunderstood the purpose of these lanes!!

The lanes are not actually designed for increasing the flow of ALL the traffic, in fact, most traffic was sacrificed by DOT for the betterment of the real citizens of this country; the job creators. 

Now, as I fly passed all the traffic (i.e. Peasants) on i405, in my exclusive lane filled with BWMs, Mercedes, Teslas and the occasional vanpool, I am thankful that a group proven to die more in car accidents (poor people) are kept away from us, behind their impenetrable double white line barrier. 

I am also thrilled to see that our beloved peace protectors (police) have been so diligent about catching the 'unwelcome' when they cross the double white line and quickly remind the violators to get back in your peasant lane where you belong and hand them a fat reminder they can't afford to pay.

"Some of the article is about minors.   It doesn't change the fact.   With lawful regulated sex workers, men could find legal sex, instead of having to rely on illegal sex, which might be with a minor because currently, since all prostitution is illegal, gives them a mean to make money for their pimps.

While some johns are probably down for underage sex, most probably just wants sex and may not even know they are having sex with a minor.

So we take out the illegal prostitution from the mix, it leaves the law enforcement and courts free to deal with the various illegal sex crimes that happens, like underage sex and people forcing underage girls to have sex.

That is a win win for everyone.

"I'm as blue as they come in this city, but I'm voting against this. It's just too much money, with too little payoff. It keeps us stuck in our SFH-centric neighborhoods. It keeps our reliance on surface streets as our primary mode of transportation. It only benefits neighborhoods that already have a good amount of service, while continuing to ignore other communities.

 Look at their district 7 improvements -- It's supposed to be downtown, interbay, queen anne, magnolia, SLU... so what are the first 2 projects listed? northgate bus service! Oh boy! Then they have the 3rd project -- Oh look, something for Madison Valley. The fourth? West Seattle! The 5th? Rainier Beach. NONE OF THESE BENEFIT DISTRICT 7. 

They have their own fucking districts, and here they are being put into district 7 improvements. Nobody in Interbay gives a fuck about the northgate commute, we're sick of 15th/Elliot being a parking lot at rush hour (even on a bus), the lack of transit that doesn't go to Ballard, and stuff like that.

Then look at the ""what we have"" improvements. Ballard bridge retrofit? That's district 6. Finally we have 2 projects -- one to seismically refit the bridge that's been ranked as the worst-quality bridge in the city for some time. And then a couple ID fixes -- district 2, not 7. 

Sorry, this bill does nothing to benefit district 7. It's a complete cash grab from those people, who will probably vote for it anyway, and giving it away to the same neighborhoods that all city improvement dollars get sent to -- namely, everything east of i-5, and ballard.

"Have you ever actually driven on I5 when there's light traffic? The natural flow of traffic runs at about 70 in a 60, in a 70, most people tend towards 75 and yes maybe up to 80. But there is SO MUCH research about this, and it says that actually most people drive at the speed they feel safe driving at (and ARE safe driving at) and, for the most part, it's actually safer this way. A 60 mph speed limit is really just a ticket trap, it doesn't make you safer. It's an 8 lane highway, if you can't safely drive it at 70mph you shouldn't even be on the road. I say this as someone who learned to drive in a country with higher speed limits (usually unenforced unless you doing over 85) and smaller, windier highways and a far better car safety record.

The speed limits are often not set for a reason, they are almost entirely arbitrary outside of city streets in fact. But everyone is so shit scared of traffic safety groups they won't do the sensible thing and raise the speed limit (see Gov. Inslee). I'm not saying we should just let everyone go at it, but there is a balance of speed and safety and U.S. highways tend to be way too far on the safety side.",,,,OSUBrit,Freelard,,1444979417,t5_2qhad,t3_3oyb5x,t1_cw1likj,13,1447002023,0,0,cw1md8p,Seattle,13,,flair

That means the gas tax values every road the same, regardless of how much the land is worth that the road is built on. Thus, roads in urban cores are effectively underpriced, and it's econ 101 that when a limited resource is underpriced, it is overused: hence, congestion.

"The relevant info:
&gt;""Health officials want people who have eaten at a Chipotle between October 14 and 23, and become ill with vomiting and bloody diarrhea, to see their health care provider and mention this outbreak.""

&gt;Chipotle released the following statement Saturday and said all stores near where the illnesses were reported were temporarily closed.

&gt;&gt;""The safety and wellbeing of our customers is always our highest priority. After being notified by health department officials in the Seattle and Portland, Ore. areas that they were investigating approximately 20 cases of E. coli, including people who ate at six of our restaurants in those areas, we immediately closed all of our restaurants in the area out of an abundance of caution, even though the vast majority of these restaurants have no reported problems. We are working with health department officials to determine the cause of this issue. We offer our deepest sympathies to those who have been affected by this situation."" 

&gt;OHA said Chipotle did not have to close its restaurants by law.

&gt;The health authority also issued a health alert to healthcare providers, notifying them to the possible outbreak and urging them to test patients who ate at Chipotle restaurants and show signs of E. coli for the bacteria.

&gt;Anyone who has eaten at a Chipotle in Oregon or Washington in the past 10 days should contact a doctor if they show signs of STEC infection. Symptoms include stomach pain, cramping, bloody stools, nausea and vomiting. The OHA said patients generally recover from infection within five to 10 days. Some infected people can develop kidney failure but those cases are rare and most often seen in young children and the elderly, Modie said.

"I've been 2 times- wish I could make it a priority to go more. If you're the type of person that enjoyed the community aspect of church but hate the dogma you will probably enjoy Seattle Assembly.

There's a lot of ""churchy"" type things that feel familiar to my days of attending church with my family. You sing songs (non-religious and usually a focus on nature and being a good person), they have a ""meet your neighbors"" time, there's always a speaker. 

One time, the speaker was a professor at UW speaking on mindfulness, it was awesome. The group is diverse, children, older adults, certainly more young adults then you would see at a normal church Sunday. 

They encourage other social events (volunteering, donating time, helping others) as well as meeting up for burgers and a beer after the ""service"".

I was really looking for a community outside my friend group that didn't make me feel uncomfortable and this is the place for that.

"&gt; Some of us just want Amazon to be outside of the city.

So how should a company anticipate this? Amazon started out as a small company that pretty much just filled Pac-Med. Should they have decided to leave after growing to a certain point? How is that fair to the employees who mostly live in proximity in the city?

Should they have never opened up shop here to begin with? If so, should any business open their doors in Seattle? Should all employers be outside and employees make the reverse commute out to the burbs? And should we *encourage* people to live in the suburbs by encouraging employers to move there as well? Do we want to increase the number of people living in the suburbs?

Or do we ask companies to create their own little ""company town"" that everyone lives on out in the middle of nowhere? Let's concentrate all economic activity in the middle of nowhere, rather than in our major cities, right?

"Yes, Amazon's leveling structure is very flat.  Entry level salaried to Director is 4 promotions (from L4 to L8).

Also, the mentality isn't that a promotion is recognition of work that you've done, but an acknowledgement that the work you're doing is sufficiently complex, impactful, broad enough so as to warrant a more senior person.  You do the job of the next level and operate at that level, and *then* you get promoted.  What that also means is that if your area isn't one where there is sufficient complexity, impact, or scope, you will *not* promote, no matter how good you are at your job, because your job simply doesn't warrant a more senior role.  The level is a function of the role, not of the person filling it.

Regarding compensation, Amazon uses a total compensation model that is difficult to understand at first.  There is a number for each person, based on role, level, tenure, location, and performance ratings.  That is the total amount that Amazon wants to pay you.  They will hit that target using base salary, cash bonuses (usually only at the beginning), and stock grants.  So you might only see a 3% increase in base salary in your review, but you'll also get a stock grant and 15% annual stock growth is expected (and the stock usually beats that projection).  All of that is projected out for 5 years, but that 5 year projection isn't a report that is shown to employees (not sure why).

In some (most?) companies, stock is viewed as a bonus, so you expect bigger increases to your salary.  At Amazon, stock is a core part of your compensation, so the salary increases are smaller.  

Edit: According to [this article](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-04-10/amazon-keeps-ceo-bezos-total-pay-at-1-68-million), the most anyone at Amazon makes in base salary is $175k, so if you make $100k (base) today as a level 5 something or other, you shouldn't expect 10% increases.",,,,1b2f58644ad9410b9d36,,,1445711348,t5_2qhad,t3_3q0mqe,t1_cwb8zhm,38,1447171515,0,0,cwbdkgd,Seattle,38,,

The general rule is that tips belong to the employees unless otherwise stated (like if you live in a state with tip-crediting, which we do not) or in the event that you pool tips, which it sounds like you do. Still, by law, pooled tips are really only supposed to go to SOME employees and it's almost never managers. The best thing to do is retain expert help on how to deal with it. If other employees think this is unfair, you can organize to fight the policy—or you may find out that it's not a lawful policy to begin with.

"The state is entirely to blame here.  I had a group move in across the way from me.  They were loud, disruptive, lived on top of their trash (an open dumpster was across the street).  The dealbreaker was when they littered the area with those orange capped needles.  

I called SPD, they said they would look into it. Nothing happened.  Called back the next day.  Nothing happened.  Tried twitter with Cap Hill Blog and SPD.  They finally mention it's not public land, its SDOT land, so talk to them.  Called SDOT, they said they would look into it.  Nothing happened.  Called again. They tell me it's actually not their land, its Washington State Department of Transit land.  Called WDOT.  Nothing happened.  Called again.  They tell me it's a minimum 3 day ""eviction"" notice (for trespassing!!!) and since that puts us on a Friday, earliest they would get it to it is that Monday.  

The homeless cleared out that weekend before the state ever actually intervened.  They left behind a mountain of broken future, trash, and used needles.  Again, this is across the street from an open dumpster.  This was after 3 weeks of engaging with the state trying to get their help.

"The point people miss when they say that people should just move further out is that there are expenses and complications to living far from a city. The jobs are not in places like Bonney Lake, they are in the cities, which means that if you want to pay for your house, you have to travel to and from the city every day. Bonney Lake is 40 miles from Seattle. Traffic is not great getting to and from Seattle on any day of the week, and if you are travelling at rush hour, you are looking at hours in a car every day. When you are getting paid $10/hr, it's kind of painful to waste away 2+ hours for the privilege of working there. Then consider that you have to pay for parking in downtown Seattle once you arrive, and that the average car gets less than 30 mpg, and that car insurance is mandatory (and I'm not saying it shouldn't be, just that it's another expense) at an average of $67/mo in WA state. By the time someone gets to work at their low-pay, low-skill job, the first few hours of work are spent just trying to make up their expenses for coming to work at all.

Now consider that low-pay, low-skill jobs have low job security. Also consider that it's common for retail jobs to keep everyone at under 30 hours a week so they don't have to pay full-time benefits or risk anyone going overtime. When you are travelling 40 miles a day, the chances of something interfering with your ability to get to work on time is much higher than if you walk 1 mile. An accident on the road, a car problem, construction you were not aware of, etc. If you are ""smart"" about it, you will leave for work extra early every day so you don't lose your job, but the downside is that now you have to set aside more than the 2+ hour commute time, just to stay employed at a place which does not pay your bills. Since you can't work full-time there anyway, you are now forced to get a second job - and if you are lucky, it will be close to your first job - but you have to leave this buffer time of inactivity between all your jobs because you know they'll fire you for any reason. So now you're ""working"" 50 hours a week, but when you count travel and buffer times, you are actually away from home 65+ hours a week.

I did my time in retail and food-service when I was younger, and it was also pretty common for employers to start sending people home if business was slower than expected. Or for them to keep employees ""on call"" in case they were busier than expected. ""On call"" means you are required to be at your employer's beck and call (meaning you cannot work another job) without being paid. As for being sent home early - might be nice for your 17 yr old co-worker, but if you *need* that money and have to stick around anyway because your other job down the street doesn't start for another 4 hours, you're screwed.

I think some of you people seriously don't understand what it's like to be poor and have no job security. If all of your jobs have been 40 hours a week, in an office, with predictable hours and pay, you don't understand why a 40 mile commute can be so unbearable. It's not like everyone who wants housing near Seattle's business center is an entitled whiner hoping to score a ""ritzy"" condo near all the fancy bars for next to nothing. These are people who just want to be near their jobs because it is less expensive and less taxing on their personal lives.",,,,startstopandstart,,,1445822345,t5_2qhad,t3_3q5u2m,t1_cwcfstl,10,1447197187,0,0,cwcv7ed,Seattle,10,,

"Making Seattle bike friendly is as simple as adding completely separate bike lanes along major cycling thoroughfares. All we need are a few more Burke-Gilmans without the missing links. Traveling the majority of your commute on a protected/separate bike lane is such a huge relief.

&gt;I can see that the cost and complexity of making Seattle more bike friendly would be so huge that even I wouldn't vote for an attempt to do so

I don't understand you here. This isn't a black or white situation. It is a slow change (I think it could be a bit faster of course). Sure it's going to cost money. But contrary to popular belief cyclists do pay taxes for infastructure, and I think most reasonable non-cyclists can see the benefits of improving non-motorized infrastructure.

As someone who commutes in Bellevue with routes that take me on shared lanes (with absolutely no alternative)...... Even just a few protected bike lanes (or even just normal bike lanes) makes a world of difference, and Seattle has a good start.

"Having played both rugby and football I can assure you that football is more dangerous than rugby. Rugby is continuous play like soccer, football is played in quick 4-8 second bursts in which players are moving as fast as possible and exerting as much force as possible from the time the ball is snapped until the whistle. Furthermore, the pads provide a false sense of security. In reality they allow you to hit much harder and with reckless form. You don't have to worry about rugby players intentionally leading with their head, which is how most concussions and other serious injuries occur. I have delivered and received much more violent and punishing hits playing football than I ever did rugby.

"See, most of the people that hang out in City Hall park are being treated by DESC (Downtown Emergency Services Center), located across the street.

"Weird, right? I chalk it up to strategy plus ego creating force of habit. 

Strategy in that there is a chance word of the filing will catch opposing counsel off guard just before the weekend, or ruin their Monday morning. Will it affect the outcome of the case? Probably not, of course, but they figure pressing every edge equals zealous representation. 

And ego because litigators tend to believe last minute pressure sharpens their own thinking. Remembering that one time they thought of something ""brilliant"" in the clutch, they hold off in case inspiration strikes: some element of their case they didn't think to include, some research they left out, etc. 

The habit shows up in filing lawsuits (wait until the deadline for filing a claim, etc.) but gets reinforced throughout the schedules of all the cases they have open. Every lawsuit filing generates a court order listing deadlines for both sides to follow. For example, a date by which the plaintiffs have to disclose which experts they plan to have testify for them at trial. The plaintiff lawyers have all their experts hired and working long before this deadline, but they would rather die than disclose it one second before the court requires it. And so on, all through their career. 

In the old days of paper filings I often had to literally run in my work clothes to the King County Courthouse because the lawyers would not sign the goddam pleadings until I was screaming. You sprint up the stairs to the clerk's office rather than risk a slow elevator. And when you get there the office is jammed with messengers and low end law firm grunts like me, all of us sweaty and jostling to get our precious docs registered before deadline.

The company bought the building earlier this year and stresses that it will be operated as an apartment building – albeit one whose tenants must meet a particular condition.

Seattle Sober Living simply leases individual apartment units to tenants – with the key difference being that all units must be drug and alcohol free.” The parameters for this are set under this state law.

The only difference is that, as part of each tenant’s housing agreement, and consistent with state law, they must remain drug- and alcohol-free to remain in their apartment. The use or possession of drugs or alcohol will result in expedited eviction as authorized under state law.”

"Guessing the usual reason for not identifying the suspects by appearance applies.


It's weird, people could help give assistance by knowing what the attackers looked like, and presumably the victims got a great look at the attackers and yet ... ST choses to omit that detail.

It seems out of whack we'd let social justice or concern over what internet trolls might say dictate the need to know what alleged criminals look like.

Without the detail, this is left to the imagination, which is usually worse than reality in most cases.

Edit: Found detail, thanks to http://www.capitolhillseattle.com ... which, as usual, is more reliable a local news source than Seattle Times.

&gt;A witness who saw the group ditch the purse in a nearby garbage can provided police with descriptions of the suspect including one distinctly dressed female. Police found part of the group walking nearby on 10th Ave including the black female with blonde hair and braces, wearing red pants and boots. The red pants suspect was identified by a witness and taken into custody. The victim was treated at the scene for injuries sustained in the attack.

It's expensive and I've been a number of times but in NO WAY is it top ten ranked in the USA in any real ranking.  Rover's was WAY better, fancier, and they had the general feel set right so nobody was asking you for another waffer-thin-mint, monsieur, and even Rover's had no chance in a national ranking. 

Maybe some restaurant is going to pull this off soon, it seems likely, but Seattle has not got it going yet, which is probably good for the rest of us.

Now you can spend more at Canlis, which was much cheaper 12 years ago, and get a much worse meal, although you get to order from the short order cook, which is convenient.  They make a big deal about having tons of ancient wine.

THAT'S the part you're missing.

"From the article:
*New Jersey and Washington were the only two states where both poverty and inequality – how inequitably income is distributed – increased.*

Doesn't New Jersey have both a sales tax AND an income tax?

And then this from the article:

*North Dakota saw the number of poor people, but not its poverty rate, increase, while four states – Colorado, New Hampshire, Texas and Wyoming – saw their poverty rates and/or numbers decrease.*

And doesn't Texas and Wyoming have only sales taxes and no income tax?  Heck New Hampshire has neither and their poverty rate/numbers decreased!

How can that be???  If an income tax is the cure for all our ills, how can these claims from the article be true?  
  
Could it possibly be that the type of tax system in a state has little to do with people being poor and remaining in poverty???

"How about this argument... I shop at PCC because I support local, sustainable farming practices and it's much easier to find that at a local grocer than a national chain? Also because it's the closest grocery store to my house.

On whether or not genetic engineering is safe? Well, I worked in a lab for a year genetically engineering algae to produce more lipid that could be used as biofuel, and while we worked with some nasty stuff, scientists have a good grasp on what they are doing. 

However, people talk like selective breeding and GMO are the same thing (they aren't), and like all GMO's are doing positive things for the economy (they aren't). Less than a dozen GMO crops are approved in the US by the USDA. But most of the corn, soybeans, and cotton we now grow in the US are GMO. 

I'm going to talk about corn because I lived in Iowa for a while and know corn fairly well:  The US spends hundreds of millions of dollars in corn subsidies each year. A TINY fraction of the corn we grow is directly consumed by humans (I'm talking single-digit percentage, if that). Most of the corn grown in the US goes to: 1) animal feed or 2) processing into high fructose corn syrup or corn ethanol (it's actually done in the same factories at different times of year). 

People act like we're using GMO's to save the starving populations of the world, but that's just not the reality. In reality, most of the GMO corn economy goes toward increasing yields that are fed to the food we eat (cattle, pigs, chicken, etc.), or processed into something that's been proven to cause our rising obesity rates (HFCS), or processed into something we literally just burn for fuel (that is less efficient than other fuel methods). 

GMO's are more than just ""Is it safe? Y/N"". I don't support increased obesity from diets high in fatty meats and cheap (thanks, subsidies!) junk foods filled with high fructose corn syrup, or inefficient fuel methods forced on us by the US government, so I vote with my dollars and avoid GMO corn.

...I haven't even gotten started on the monoculture aspect, increasing tolerance to pesticides (requiring new methods in time), and that nearly zero large-scale conventional farms in the midwest follow best practices when it comes to nitrogen fertilizer rates.

"I do not run containers. They don't pay squat. Plus I don't speak Spanish nor Russian, I would have a hard time. As for the new regs, I don't agree with them. They will end up snuffing a lot of small companies out and a lot of people will be out of work. If containers need to be moved, the change in regs will kill it as the companies in charge of that operation will not be able to afford a whole new fleet of trucks. Look at California for example. They have so many restrictions now, that small companies and owner operators refuse to go there. This hurts their business, both import and export.

"Hi there! I have a couple of friends who built Tiny Houses here in Seattle, and I was going to do it myself, until I chickened out due to the grey legal area in which the Tiny House fits.

I don't have a suggestion for where to build it - that's up to your friend's network - but make sure it is in the back yard, and not visible from the street. Any construction visible from the street can be brought to the attention of the authorities, and for quite a while your little Tiny House is going to be an eyesore. (Sad, but true. Takes about 6 months to get it ready to be skinned.)

Once a complaint is filed against the homeowner, you have a number of HOURS to address the issue. (72 hours, IIRC.) And the tiny house is not ready to be moved for quite a while after you start. (Stresses of towing, etc.) So you could be forced to tear down all your progress, move the trailer, and rebuild elsewhere, if a neighbor complains. (And every block has One Of Those Neighbors!)

Once you get into Unincorporated King County, you have a much better chance of finding a spot that will work for your build.

One friend of mine rented a mother-in-law apartment in a farmhouse out in the Monroe area, and built hers there.

So. Yeah. Head's up.

And I love the Elm! Great little floorplan, although I have always wondered about the two-bedroom idea in a Tiny House... seems a little excessive to me!  :-)",,,,happycj,Georgetown,,1443908583,t5_2qhad,t3_3ndsma,t3_3ndsma,17,1446752267,0,0,cvn58gq,Seattle,17,,flair
"See, it's justifications like this which sound reasonable, but are really just excuses for inaction. Yes, this area has a significant affordable housing problem, and this is going to exacerbate that problem. But that should inspire us to make better decisions with housing and actually take steps to lower housing costs -- not serve as a justification to turn people away. By the time these refugees make it to Seattle, they'll have traveled about 10,000 kilometers -- do we really want to be the type of people who say ""well, it just doesn't make sense for them to come here. We're just too rich for them to afford being here.""

Please understand that I'm not dismissing your claims. This is going to be an issue, and it's a legitimate one. But maybe this influx of refugees will serve as a catalyst for action on an issue where city council and the mayor's office have failed to make significant progress for far too long. And even if it doesn't, that doesn't mean that we shouldn't do our best to welcome these people who have escaped conditions and circumstances that most of us will be thankful to never, ever experience, and help them adapt to a new life as part of this community.

"I would start with exploring the limits of RCW 9A.84.630 to see how well it applies to the case: ""[a]ny person who in any way, directly or indirectly, by menace or unlawful means, attempts to influence any person in refusing to give his or her vote in any primary or special or general election is guilty of a gross misdemeanor punishable to the same extent as a gross misdemeanor ...""

Not sure just *how* applicable 9A.84.630 would be to this case, but it is a start.

As for the other issues, this notice is patently defective, in my opinion. SMC requires 60 days' notice for rent increases. Here he gives what appears to be 60 days' notice, but it looks like it is a contingent rent increase on some indeterminate numbers. My quick five minute search on my practice guides are silent as to whether rent increases must be laid out specifically for notice to be effective, but I bet dollars to doughnuts that a judge would think long and hard before upholding this notice. 

Most importantly, and why I smell blood in the water here, is because the landlord sounds like a loose cannon. If a tenant objects to the rent increase and attempts to move out on this basis, the landlord will likely give the tenant trouble. Because his rent increases appear to be so passionately tied to an election result, the landlord is likely financially insecure on his mortgage payments and will look for any little thing to charge the tenant. Often times they go way outside of the scope of chargeable fees and tread into charging a tenant for reasonable wear and tear or treating part of the deposit as non-refundable when the lease is silent to that particular matter. They also may wait longer than the fourteen days to get their deposit or a statement as to why they are withholding their deposit (all or in part) and can be on the hook for double the deposit + attorneys' fees.

"I havent lived in Seattle long enough to have a ton of context, honestly. I'm from back East originally. But where I'm from, you would basically never have people attacking police the way they do in Seattle. Criticism is fine, but if you want good policing it takes the whole community being committed to it. Policing is hard and dangerous work. You cant just want the police gone and also clean streets, which seems to be the Seattle attitude. 

edit: I'm not blaming SPD. My guess is they are justified to be pissed off at the community to some degree. Just like the community is justified to be pissed that they shot a deaf homeless guy on the street. But, you catch more flies with honey than vinegar. If the community wants clean streets, then police have to get out there and arrest the tweaker homeless. There has to be procedure for cleaning up encampments.

You can totally drink it, but it doesn't look great and it will definitely be used against you if your performance is lacking. But it's typically nontraditional for office jobs to drug test you unless you're working in labor intensive job at the company or operating heavy machinery on a regular basis.

**Edit:** Googled it. [THC Detox's website](http://thcdetox.biz/blog/do-amazon-drug-test-employees/) says Amazon does drug test their employees, but considering it's a third party source I've never heard of (which isn't surprising since it's not a resource I look for often), I'm not sure how valid it is. Regardless, looks like a gamble!

&gt;Absolutely, yes, they do. There are only like a 3 step process in applying for a job in the Amazon. The chain of Amazon retail industries abides by these imperative application progress and these goes to every employee, new or existing. The application process is pretty straightforward:
&gt;
&gt; * In the case of direct hiring, candidates get to be interviewed by the operations manager, you get to attend an orientation paid by Amazon themselves.
&gt; * Pass a background check and this is when all questions about your work experience and personal life is asked, flipped, and turned about inside out.
&gt; * Pass the drug test which is the final part of the 3 step application process. This is as well the part where one gets to be decided whether a post on Amazon is due to the applicant or otherwise.

"I don't know if it's possible for any major city to ""maintain"" its unique culture. Rather, I think of our culture as constantly in flux (as with any other growing city). If you look at the reasons why businesses/people desire to be in any place, they are often economic opportunity (jobs, resources), environment (safe, clean), and lifestyle (things to do, places to see).

In a sense, this is the ""culture"" that attracts people to come to Seattle. We can provide these things but the way in which we provide them doesn't necessarily have to stay the same forever. The attractive jobs of tomorrow may be different from today. The architecture and nightlife of tomorrow may be very different in the future than what we have today.

Big cities like New York and Chicago constantly go through these culture changes; yet they are still seen as desirable places to live in. ""Cookie-cutter"" cities exist because most humans have cookie-cutter desires (clean/safe environment, decent transportation, solid infrastructure).

"&gt;We should not tax the things that we encourage. I'd say income should be encourage more than purchases.

That can't be the guide to a solution in itself, though. While *anyone* can agree that spending money is the worst way to save money (which is the root of the pro- sales/luxury tax arguments), those taxes unfairly impact the poor for a really simple reason: at the end of the day, you can only own so many TVs. 

Someone earning 35,000 a year might buy 500-1000 in digital electronics a year (I think I'm probably *under*estimating that), which would be around 1.5 and 3% of their annual gross income. 

Someone earning 10 times that might own two houses of significantly larger size, but for the same percentage of their income, they'd have to buy 10 times as many televisions. Which is silly. No one needs that many televisions.

And you can take any other section of retail and compare it similarly. The rich will always spend a smaller percent of their income on consumer goods, simply because a person still only eats 3 meals a day, and has so many gadgets, and being well-off or rich doesn't scale in that market. 

So scaling our taxes based on consumer goods purchases will always impact the poorer end more. That's why there are federal income tax brackets instead of flat taxes. A flat federal income tax would devastate low-income earners. 

To be clear, I'm not saying the answer is to abolish the sales tax or anything.

"No, the goal is to make things better by increasing housing capacity within a five mile radius of downtown, so that a significantly larger number of  people can live within short biking distance to the center.  A bicycle is a more appropriate vehicle for a city that has reached a certain level of population density.  It simply won't work for everybody to drive a car at such a level of density, namely because a car just takes up too much space -- both when parked and when in motion.  A car is a barrier to another car's path in a way that a bike is not to another bike.  Also, there are certain motor vehicles that do serve necessary functions, like emergency vehicles, delivery vehicles and vans driven by crafts people (e.g., plumbers, carpenters, electricians, etc), and every car on the road just creates the externality of congestion for the more essential vehicles.

As for those who live 20 miles away, they're free to drive in if they can find a way to make it work, but I don't think their needs should be prioritized.  If the city needs more labor from outside the city, better to just increase housing capacity within the city itself and to encourage telecommuting.

"There's really no reason to treat genetically engineered plants differently from ""natural"" plants. ""Natural"" plants have also been subjected to selective breeding. While the selective breeding isn't as radical as genetic engineering, it's just as capable of having unintended consequences. 

Really, I think people doing real genetic engineering are more likely to be able to detect when they accidentally make something toxic than someone doing conventional seed selection.

I definitely don't like pesticide-resistant plants like Monsanto makes, but that doesn't mean GMO's are bad. I'd rather we have more discussion of what cultivars are in use and what they're bred for.

"You need a license to drive a car because you are far more likely to kill, hurt, or damage someone/something with it. Damage from cars also costs a heck of a lot more so it makes sense to be able to keep tabs on driver's history as well as make sure they are certified (or at least try to certify) to operate a piece of heavy machinery. Cyclists are most at risk to hurt or kill themselves in a collision. You can also ride at any age, so at what age do you require a license? I was already cursing some streets when I was 10 with my parents, 12 on my own, but I don't think a license process would be good for people of that age. It also causes problems if tourists/visitors come to the state: bike rentals are a common enough way to get around for some people and needing a license would impede that.

I think adding cyclist awareness to the driver's license education along with adding cycling education into school in middle and high school would go a long ways. Besides the vast majority of cyclists are licensed drivers. The reality is most cyclists know the laws: they just chose not to obey them. Yeah it is frustrating as hell, especially as a cyclist who knows the rules and follows them, but with licensing I don't think it would fix anything and just add an unnecessary burden that wouldn't fix much of anything.",,,,xarune,Fremont,,1444673060,t5_2qhad,t3_3ogh1g,t1_cvx01uy,10,1446925067,0,0,cvx5jo5,Seattle,10,,flair

"It's possible a human in the neighborhood poisoned the pigeons, and the crows, being the opportunistic scavengers they are, simply saw the bodies as free lunch. I've seen crows in my neighborhood picking at dead rats and squirrels that got squashed by cars--they are not fussy eaters.

I'm sure crows are capable of killing pigeons, but they prefer easy pickings. Killing a pigeon is way too much work, especially in a city where there's no shortage of food. So I'd bet the pigeons were already dead, either from poison or a disease outbreak.",,,,Lawn_Killer,U District,,1444892336,t5_2qhad,t3_3otjz0,t3_3otjz0,12,1446981072,0,0,cw0ep68,Seattle,12,,flair

Same. The most memorable time I saw someone nonchalantly stroll away was at the capitol hill farmer's market. A tiny dog took a huge dump in the middle of the market and the owner didn't even notice because she was texting.
