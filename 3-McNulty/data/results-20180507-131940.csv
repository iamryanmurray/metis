"&gt; Its tax money being collected from people before it can be utilized -- Well, yes. That's how taxes work. And we're also collecting gas and property taxes today for infrastructure projects that won't be started for decades, too. There isn't any difference here between road infrastructure funding and rail infrastructure funding.

Right? How are projects supposed to get started without funds? Is the government supposed to pay all of the people who plan and execute these projects with a credit card?

&gt; Not everyone will use it. Well, I don't use I-405, but I have to help pay for that too. 75,000 people use ST's system every day already. I can imagine that number would at least quadruple when ST3 is built.

Again - couldn't agree with you more. As demonstrated by the dramatically rising Link ridership, the demand is there. These are people who are using transit instead of driving or taking a bus, so actually does benefit people who don't take the trains. It means more room on buses and more room on the roads. So even if he cannot or will not grasp the concept that living in a society necessitates paying for things that don't give you direct and immediate gratification, expanding light rail actually does benefit him.

What Trump is saying is not ""brave"". Well, his ability to force the Repubs away from TPP is, but other than that - he is selling people a pitch that doesn't make sense. He's not doing what Sanders did, which was tell his supporters to become politically engaged and support downballot candidates so change would happen no matter who's President. He's saying ""I can handle everything on my own"". But unless he intends to be a dictator, that is not a ""brave"" thing to say. It's blatantly lying to your supporters. He's also telling people what they want to hear, even if it isn't true - there simply isn't capacity for so many well-paying manufacturing jobs like there was in the 50s. Automation is advancing quickly and making traditional manufacturing obsolete. When he says he'll basically create jobs out of thin air, you ought to be suspicious rather than lauding his bravery.

You know what would be brave? If he broke with party doctrine and said that we need to boldly address the massive threat of climate change. Unfortunately, he's being bought by the fossil fuel industry.

As for national security, he's likewise just telling people what they want to hear, not what will help them.

Since they're an endangered species, you can't just use traps that kill or injure them, so there are specially-built traps that keep them alive and allow them to still lay their eggs. Then you call Animal Control and they'll come empty your trap and relocate the tree octopus and its eggs to a safer habitat.

"I live in Bellingham and this is a huge issue (relative to the size of the city) because of all the college students constantly moving out.

Scheduling was a breeze, and the process from the first call to set up the eye appointment to the actual surgery took about a week.  Dr. Sharpe really did a good job talking us through the surgery (which was extremely short, around 3.5 minutes per eye) and I never felt a point during the surgery where I was putting my eyes at risk.  The technology is all laser and no blades were involved.  Both of us haven't suffered any side effects from the surgery, other than minor halo'ing effects from light sources at night which, from what I researched, is pretty common.

"There have been countless cases of SJW groups attempting (and in many cases succeeding) to shut down the speaking platforms of people they don't agree with.  There have been multiple cases on Twitter where ""problematic"" people have been banned not for doing anything horrible, but simply for expressing their opinions that happen to differ from the SJW line.  (If you wish I can pull up some articles about these when I get the chance.  I'm about to run some errands so I can when I get back)

There have also been multiple cases where SJW groups on college campuses have attempted to silence journalists from doing their job because they're apparently invading a ""safe space"" that happened to be on public grounds and was generating lots of attention.

On the equality side of things... it's painful how stupid some of the beliefs on equality are.  It is a widely held belief within the Social Justice community that ""white privilege"" is a real thing and it's ravaging the world with inequality.  The simple idea that just because a person is white instantly gives them more privilege than someone who isn't white.  Hilariously enough one of the most vocal and well known ""black supremacists"" on YouTube, Gazi Kodzo, has actually admitted in his videos to have grown up VERY pampered and somewhat spoiled as a child... and this is someone who thinks he deserves reparations from white people because they have ""white privilege"" even though it is more than likely that he grew up way more privileged than the people who he is pressuring to donate to him.  Cultural appropriation is another major issue that SJWs blow up about.  They work themselves up about how someone from one culture can't in any way practice something from another culture because that's somehow racist.

"&gt; This would need to be witnessed by an officer in order for them to be able to stop and identify the driver and write a citation.

This feels like a canard. If video surveillance isn't admissible as ""witness"" then why is it used for other types of prosecutions like property crime? ( I imagine body and car cameras have some special police rule )

Is there a specific restriction on video testimony, or is it just a department policy? The City Attorney should be the decider on this one, not individual officers.

"There was a sharp increase in car/bike crashes on 2nd when the sidepath first went in, but they've made some changes since the original implementation -- pulled parking back further from the garage entrances, for better sight distances, and more recently added speed humps at the garage entrances to slow down both bicyclists and drivers.

It's important to recognize that designs like 2nd Ave are **not** intended as all-ages-and-abilities infrastructure.  2nd is safe at rolling-pedestrian speeds, where the short sight distances at garage entrances give drivers adequate time to see and react to cyclists.  

But if you want to ride faster than around 10-12 mph, you're going too fast for the design of the separated facility, you should be out in the street.  (Not just because of the short sight distances, but also the very narrow lane width -- faster cyclists are a hazard to slower users of the sidepath, too.  NACTO would say it should be at least 20% wider for the level of traffic it carries.)",,,,jmputnam,,,1471299265,t5_2qhad,t3_4xuegy,t1_d6iu3ki,13,1473423040,0,0,d6iwlqc,Seattle,13,,

"I see a lot of poo-pooing of the idea that anyone should be concerned about drink spiking, since every study indicates it's ""super-duper rare"", but I think these are off base for a couple of reasons.

Yes, there are certainly many ""urban legend"" level 2nd hand stories of everyone knowing ""someone"" (who knows how many degrees of separation away) who totally had their drink spiked that one time. And yes there are no shortage of people who simply get blackout drunk, embarrass themselves and then look for something to blame. (I, for one, find it unbelievable how common it is for people to get drunk to the point of incapacitation on a semi-regular basis and don't consider it to be at all a problem.) And too there are many reports of studies that have shown how few verifiable instances of drink spiking tend to occur. All of which should lead people to increase their skepticism of reports of drink spiking, to some degree.

But there are several reasons why people shouldn't pretend the problem is unworthy of concern. A big one is that for the same reason that people blame drink spiking on getting black out drunk, the reverse likely happens as well, with people never realizing their drinks have been spiked. As important, instances of drink spiking are almost certainly underreported. Some because instances of drink spiking resulting in sexual assault are likely underreported because of the chronic underreporting of sexual assault in general. Some because it can be very difficult to verify or backtrack an incident after the fact, and people know this. When such a thing happens the victim is incapacitated, so they are extremely unlikely to seek police protection or medical care in that moment. It could be hours or days later before they have the wherewithal to decide to make a police statement. If no sexual assault happened they are unlikely to do so though, because they almost certainly won't know who the perpetrator was, and they may well feel that there's very little to be done about it.

The level of drink spiking reported from studies is a lower bound, not an upper bound, and for the reasons I outlined it's probably low by anywhere from a factor of ... 2? to maybe a factor of 10 or more. We just don't know. But the fact that it happens at all with any regularity is concerning. Remember that this was Cosby's M.O. for decades, and the number of victims who reported it *when it happened* was basically zero, for all the reasons such things go underreported in general. The fact that it happens at all is concerning and should filter into people's behaviors when out at a bar or a party, *especially* if they're going alone, and cause people to perk up and take notice when they see someone become incapacitated and make sure they end up safe. There's no need to go all ""stranger danger"" and avoid drinking outside your own home at all, but a few easy precautions are a good idea.",,,,rocketsocks,,,1470386253,t5_2qhad,t3_4w80wi,t3_4w80wi,25,1473233663,0,0,d654jbd,Seattle,25,,

"Landlords aren't allowed to discriminate - learn some basics of housing discrimination law. 

Many Seattle landlords and developments have been found to be [openly discriminating](http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/13-rental-properties-in-seattle-accused-of-discrimination/) on the basis of race, national origin, sexual orientation and gender identity. Employment discrimination is just another form of discrimination.

&gt; Oh good. Prevent landlords from preferring low risk tenants. 

This is what they say about discriminating against black and minority applicants. It is discrimination, plain and simple. Stop being a discrimination apologist. ""Risk"" is assessed through rental references and credit, for example - not a prejudiced discrimination against source of income. 

This is the basis of open housing policy: read up on the history of housing discrimination policy. You can downvote my point all you want - but you'll be incapable of arguing that this is anything other than discrimination.

"The problem as I see it is that you have to give the criteria ahead of time. But I don't have a lot of hard and fast rules. I'm trying to maximize my profit while minimizing my risks. That means I'm not going to wait 3 months for the perfect applicant to come along while my unit sits empty. But if multiple people apply, I want to accept the most qualified.

---

Example:

The first person shows up. She has a car loan and her mother as a cosigner. She shows up first because her work schedule is more flexible. However, she has no credit score and no rental history.

The second person shows up. She has no car and no cosigner. Her credit score is good and has a long and stable rental history. Because she works minimum wage and has no car, she couldn't make it asap. She also has a cat.

In this case, I chose the second person, because she has a good credit score and rental history. However, if she hadn't chosen to apply, I would've accepted the first tenant.

---

Given the law, I would've had to choose the first tenant, because they showed up first and passed my minimum criteria (no evictions, etc.) even though the second one was actually low-income, a minority, etc.",,,,wanna_live_on_a_boat,,,1471547845,t5_2qhad,t3_4ydviv,t1_d6mz8tv,20,1473478071,0,0,d6n0ct5,Seattle,20,,

"&gt;Do you honestly think that protesting against colleges teaching things that hurt people's feewings is a smart use of a protest?

Sure, why not? People can protest what they want. It might be stupid, it might not be, but they're definitely within their rights and part of a long history of (sometimes silly) student protest.

For instance, in Bologna, student protest was so successful that they grabbed an amount of power over ""teaching things that hurt people's feewings"" that would probably shock modern observers:

&gt;Upon election the successful doctors took an oath to submit to the student rector in all matters affecting the life of the university. Student controls over the lecturing system were impressive. The lecturer's life proceeded in an anxious atmosphere of impending fines. A lecturer was fined if he started his lecture a minute late or if he continued after the prescribed time: indeed, if the latter occurred the students were required to leave the room without delay. At the opening of the academic session the students and the teaching doctors elected by the students reached agreement on how the material of the lecture course was to be distributed over the year. The harassed lecturer had to reach stipulated points in the set texts by certain dates in the session. Failure to do so resulted in a heavy fine. It would hardly be an exaggeration to say that lecturing performance in thirteenth-century Bologna was continuously assessed by the students on both a qualitative and quantitative basis. 

At any rate, get some history, get some context, and leave the Outrage Culture behind. You sound like your ""feewings"" are pretty rustled. ",,,,theKearney,,,1471727710,t5_2qhad,t3_4yp5kg,t1_d6psuua,12,1473512041,0,0,d6pt9b4,Seattle,12,,

"I drive that stretch regularly at all times of day, and live closer to the south half of 35th Ave SW. I was also at the meeting last night that they're covering. God, it was miserably hot in there when the initial huge throng of people rushed in as the doors opened.

The basic main complaint I heard was that this limits mobility of cars. 

That's the **point** of a road diet. We're too stupid to hold to the speed limit so now the cars in front of us will do it for us. All it takes is one single person to keep the limit and it stops **everyone else** from speeding for an instant victory for the public safety angle. 

I'm all for it. It's a good thing. Maybe, maybe my commute some days when I have to drive is a minute longer. Sometimes it's faster. It's all a wash, and who cares if I'm 13 minutes early for work on those days instead of 15 minutes?

There are two big reasons for this rate increase. The first is the city increased its tax rates on the utility for the public garbage program. Those get passed on to us. That's the big bump in 2017. The second is that they are expanding the utility discount program for more people who have trouble paying their utility bills, which means higher prices for those who can.

Here is the short list from the article:

**Expanded Services**

* *Redistribution of cost:* An expansion of Seattle’s Utility Discount Program, which offers 50 percent off SPU bills and 60 percent of City Light bills for low-income residents.

* *Taxes:* An expansion of Seattle’s Clean City programs, which combat graffiti, illegal dumping and littering.

* *Taxes:* Ongoing cleanups of homeless encampments.

* *Capital Investment:* The design and construction of a new and improved recycling and reuse center, which will be built on the old South Transfer Station site in South Park.

* *Capital Investment:* The completion of the city’s new North Transfer Station, which is expected to open to the public by the end of this year.

"Except that's not what happened.  Carter signed into law a bill continuing funding for the NIMH, lost the following election, which included losing the Senate and enough of the house for the right leaning Dems to just vote with the Republicans.  The bill was scrapped, the money given to states as a chunk of ""aid"" for whatever they wanted, and many mental health institutions closed across the country.

Reagan had already done this in Southern California.  He deinstitutionalized the mentally ill, moving them to adult family homes or nursing homes, where care wasn't the goal, but rather keeping as many heads as possible in the home (my ex's mother goes from place to place in these homes due to her mental health and addiction problems).  This was something organized and carried out by the Republicans.  Period.  This isn't something that's a matter of opinion, or if you remember differently, this is what actually happened.

EDIT:  This was also coupled with the start on the disastrous ""War on Drugs"", spearheaded by a Tulane University (Roll Wave!) study that claimed Marijuana was a deadly drug due to the ingestion by monkeys.  Forget that the monkeys were given 50 joints worth of smoke in 15 minutes, and they likely died of carbon monoxide poisoning, but they were smoking WEED!

"This isn't the same form of appropriation. Appropriation has more to do with the relationship of those exploiting and profiting off something with the group they're borrowing it from.

Asian immigrants have always had to tailor their food to make a living selling it to American palettes. The Chinese made sugary and syrupy Americanized Chinese, many Japanese and Koreans (Koreans had their own version of sushi - gimbap) made chunky, sweet and inauthentic sushi rolls.

In the case of Korean immigrants, Korean cuisine - with fermented cabbage, strong flavors, pickled vegetables, etc. - was simply unacceptable to the average American palette for many decades. If Koreans wanted to run a successful restaurants - they couldn't sell their own food, they had to borrow another cheap ethnic cuisine in which they could ""pass"" as authentic - sweet marinated teriyaki. 

Immigrant populations borrowing cuisine from neighboring countries so that Americans will give them business and they can survive - look at how Seattle's ""Mediterranean"" joints often blend Geek and Lebanese menus - is not the same type of appropriation.

[Much has been written](https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/08/31/childhood-friends-called-my-food-chinese-grossness-how-did-it-become-americas-hottest-food-trend/) about high-end, high-price point white chefs stealing cheap ethnic food for profit. Many have criticized folks like Andy Ricker and Rick Bayless for taking ethnic food, claiming to make it ""more authentic"" - then winning awards for profiting off another culture's cuisine. 

In many cases, immigrant populations can't cook authentic versions of their own cuisine, since Americans want something cheap and tasty, not a cultural education. But more and more, white chefs get away charging high price points for ""authentic"" ethnic cuisine, which immigrants themselves couldn't get away with. 

At the end of the day, white American chefs can get away with charging more for their version of someone else's food - this is appropriation. ",,,,lil_vega,,,1472039662,t5_2qhad,t3_4z97bt,t1_d6u4ocw,19,1473574337,0,0,d6uj851,Seattle,19,,

"Not so fast, not so simple - and also, no such thing as a ""civil crime,"" it's may be a civil matter, or a crime. Some crimes have civil counterparts, like suing a thief that the state is also prosecuting, but those have different procedures and standards of proof. 

Harassment, as defined by statute in WA, criminalizes speech that knowingly threatens another, not just with bodily harm, but also psychological harm. So, if sexual harassment crosses into something that could be construed as a threat - not just of an assault, but of any harmful act - that the target reasonably fears, then it's a crime.  

As to that ""reasonably fears"" prong, there's an exception to ER 404(b) (evidence of prior bad acts) that allows for a greater admissibility to show reasonableness of fear - basically saying you get to get the history between the people in to assist the jury in determining whether or not the alleged victim believed the defendant would carry out that threat. 

This gets tricky in terms of coded threats based on gender and sexuality, which are generally hard to prove and therefore not prosecuted, not because it's *lawful,* but rather because the *unlawfulness* is difficult to establish, and prosecutors are loathe to pursue such matters. People say shit, especially to women, LGBTQA, and non-white people all the time that creates an apprehension of harm where no specific threat is made. For example, creepy guy says ""Wow, you're looking bangin' in that dress today, sweetie,"" can make the person on the receiving end of the ""compliment"" reasonably fear that the speaker attempt to create a situation in which he can attempt to act, forcibly if necessary, on his expressed sexual interest. Dude's an unknown quantity, he's giving off a real creepy vibe, and you're all alone? That's a bad scene. It's a squiffy area at best, but it's there, even if it's pretty much impossible to prosecute.

"It's like you totally didn't read any of the words in the post. Here they are again:

&gt;* City Council usually takes August off. It's their big recess/vacation.
* Sawant is out of the country in India getting married in a traditional Indian wedding ceremon(ies), which apparently can take weeks. This was planned months ahead of time. 
* They scheduled this vote at the last minute *after* she was out of the USA already.
* Apparently these Indian ceremonies involve hundreds of people traveling all over the place. You can't exactly reschedule.
* It's tacky as fuck to expect someone to reschedule their *wedding*. I've seen people say this.

&gt; So that's why she's gone. It was a long-scheduled vacation overseas for her wedding.

Someone travelling to a birth country to have a culturally traditional wedding with family and family friends during a time that the council typically isn't in session anyway sounds perfectly reasonable to me.

But yeah. It's not great. In Seattle, 78% of homes for sale right now have a bidding war. And 56% of homes are now selling for above asking price. That's the key: When you're looking for a home right now, the asking price should be your floor. Not your ceiling.

"As a tech worker I see your point (it's not like we enjoy paying high rent BTW or are doing this on purpose!). But usually the most preferential treatment the ""preferred employers"" program gives is they knock off a $200/500 deposit or something which is great, but I don't think it will make a huge difference in comparison to rent prices. Also I believe these programs also gave the same benefits to boeing workers and people who went to college in the area(or something like that).

Without arguing about if we support them or not, I really think rule changes like this and adding restrictions to air Bnb do almost nothing at making rent more affordable. They just seem to be small symbolic changes that make it seem like progress is happening.

"I don't anymore, but I did for a little over 2 years, 2012-14! I stayed in their Videre building on 23rd and Thomas (sort of Capitol Hill/Montlake) and paid $575/mo (including all utilities and internet) for a 125sqft studio. A friend of mine also stayed in one for ~6 months. 

**Are these apartments in sketchy areas of Seattle?**           
I wouldn't say so - the one I was in is in a super neighborhoody part of Capitol Hill, right down the street from Holy Names Academy and right on the 8/43/11 bus stops. 

**2) From what I've seen on the website, these apartments don't have their own kitchens and possibly bathrooms. It says ""private baths"". What does that mean. I've seriously never seen anything like that before mentioned on an apartment listing.**           
You get your own bathroom (with a shower, not a bathtub) and in-unit refrigerator, but you do share kitchen space and laundry with other units. For me that meant sharing a kitchenette with a 4-burner stove/oven, microwave, sink + equipment (stocked by the building manager) with 6 other people. We all got our own little ""pantry"" lockers for dry good storage. I would usually just cook all of my meals on Sunday and then reheat things through the week, though there were really only 2 other residents I ever ran into using the kitchen, most people were students who only used the microwave.          
There are floor plans on their website that should make it clear what the layout of the bathrooms are! ""Private bath"" is being emphasized because there are boarding house style apartment buildings where you share a bathroom with other units - Apodments are NOT like that. 

**3) The website says ""High-speed internet included"". How true is this. Is there wifi already in the apartment? I do freelance work, which means I rely on a dependent internet connection to communicate with Editors.**             
You share internet with the other units in your block (usually 7 total) but it is pretty high speed, I never had issues streaming or using Skype. When I was there it was an ethernet outlet that I plugged my own wifi router into; wifi wasn't broadcasted. 

**4) I'm very skeptical about this one: are all utilities really included? If that's true, will I only have rent to worry about?**      
Yep, all utilities are included! You really do have flat rent.",,,,kris10leigh,,,1471890340,t5_2qhad,t3_4z1v5r,t3_4z1v5r,12,1473542895,0,0,d6s60ws,Seattle,12,,

"I got the service rep's e-mail, and I've replied, and waiting. At this point we can assume he/she will help me get sorted. But really??? I've already spent over an hour trying to redeem these. That is a SIGNIFICANT extra, unforeseen cost.

Of course The Needle offers up excuses for why one cannot redeem the cards online: their transaction processor is 'making it difficult' for them to process gift cards. (That means its too expensive or inconvenient.) And they are migrating to a new ticketing platform. Whatever. Here's the bottom line:

They are soliciting spur of the moment impulse buys of non-refundable gift cards - a likely popular product for locals who would like to have these on hand as gifts for out-of-town guests. Then Needle is throwing up hurdle after hurdle to actually using/redeeming the cards. Of course those hurdles have excuses. Of course. 

When these cards are bought, there is a reasonable assumption that they can be redeemed in a straightforward manner. That they will be honored through Needle's primary ticketing channel. Through any channel, other than Reddit complaint threads or actually just showing up at the Needle and hoping there is space/seat when there.

*I'm told my cards expire ~90 days after purchase, but I don't know that for fact, and indeed there may be a legitimate reason for that, so it hasn't been my concern. I really just wanted to take my kids, and a few of their friends, to the observation deck and lunch.

It is possible that I'm misinterpreting something ... but I don't see how. I don't think this is creditable business practice on Needle's part, regardless of how my specific instance is resolved.

EDIT: Rep tells me these cards never expire, and has provided a phone number to make reservations. (Thanks for that.)

It was predicted before the South Lake Union route went in -- the city's own consultants said the project was so dangerous that cyclists should be banned from the street.  The city went ahead anyway, but didn't even put up warning signs until cyclists sued over injuries.

It's been well-documented on South Lake Union for years -- a steady stream of emergency room admissions from both novice and experienced cyclists crashing on public streets that are officially designated as open to bicycles.

It was predicted for the First Hill route before it went in, too.  The city spent millions on a poorly-designed sidepath on Broadway, then ran the rest of the lines across multiple designated cycling routes with hardly any mitigation for the added risks.

* Trump has mocked other people's looks and is also very thin-skinned when it comes to any perceived slight.

http://www.fs.usda.gov/activity/mbs/recreation/camping-cabins/?recid=17520&amp;actid=34

It looks like camping on the meadow is not strictly prohibited, just advised against because it is destructive and makes you look like a dick. I guess someone who doesn't even care to read the rules probably doesn't care about that though.

If you want to use our land in the future maybe just be less of an selfish asshole about it.

&gt;Campers can go anywhere in the National Forest outside of a designated campground not posted as closed. Chose a campsite on bare or compacted soil when possible, or areas that have already been established. *Avoid alpine meadows.* For the best information on dispersed camping opportunities, please contact the ranger district offices.

&gt;Campers are subject to the following restrictions:
Do not blaze new roads to campsites or cut, harm vegetation or construct a trail.
Do not drive beyond constructed physical barriers, such as berms or gates. 
Do not drive through streams or wetlands to access a camp.
Use proper precautions when building campfires.
Pack out trash and dispose of human waste properly.

The segment didn't mention some things.  Like how the wheels lane would be a bit more dangerous if bicyclists went both directions on it (as it's not wide enough).  Also, in addition to the paved path, walkers also have use of the unpaved section that is adjacent to it for nearly the entire loop. 

There are lots of clueless people at Green Lake.  I'll give people a pass if they're near one of the entrances.  Usually they eventually realize on their own that they're walking in the wheels lane.  If I'm there on a bike and I have to pass clueless walkers in the wheels lane, then I'll give them a nice courtesy bell or something.  If they're still there the next time I loop around, then I might say something to them as I pass by.   

A larger problem is when walkers mindlessly cross the wheels path without looking.  Just spend one sec looking both directions before crossing to make sure no bikes are about to slam into you.

"I've never heard of prominent tech companies hiring with no interview for a full time position, minimally they'd want to talk to her in person to make sure she was generally agreeable and able to communicate.  Realistically they'd probably want to test her skill set in person, given the ease with which you could misrepresent yourself in an online contest.

Additionally, anytime a company is desperate to hire a skill set, they tend to be more flexible with start date, to make sure they get you in.  I've never had a tech company give me less than something like a month within which to schedule the start date.  A common scam tactic is to make the victim feel a sense of urgency so they don't do their due diligence in evaluating the scam, so this is another red flag.

Basically I'm saying this doesn't actually sound like a real Amazon offer, and I don't know of a tech company that would hire someone without an interview and demand they start the next business day.

"In case I don't get at reply, and to not just rake in the karma on this, this is what I would do for him:

1. I'd get his gift card number(s) and verify if they expire or not, and how much is on them. If they do expire, I could see about getting an extension for him, but I suspect they don't. I would also check to see why the 800 number isn't working.
1. I'd ask what he would like to do. If he wants to make a reservation at SkyCity, I could make sure he gets a reservation on any date he chooses. Maybe I'd even contact our Reservationist and see about getting him a free Lunar Orbiter. If he wants to visit the Observation Deck, I'd invite him to visit a shorter line at the Space Needle so he has less of a wait to purchase tickets.

My hands are unfortunately tied in helping him redeem gift cards online or over the phone. We simply don't have that in place yet, but it is something we have been working at for years since I've been here.

Why you put ""brave"" in quotes and addressed it I'll never know. Also, you comment is a string of straw-man arguments. For example : ""When he says he'll basically create jobs out of thin air, you ought to be suspicious rather than lauding his bravery"". &lt;-He didn't say that, no one said he said that, that is not on topic, and no one called him brave. I said he ""makes the left so outraged they cant see straight"", ""...he is a ballzy golden cafe"", and ""that statue is a solid C+ because of its plaque"" (Actual quotes). And, after talking to you on this internet machine I am plugged in to, I've never been more assured what I said about the left is true.

"Bill reminded me of Brooks Hatlan from Shawshank Redemption. He lives in prison for decades and becomes totally dependent upon the system. When he's released he doesn't know how to live on his own and commits suicide. I'd like our affordable housing agencies to have a more realistic view of what they can do for people and in my opinion, a lot of what they should be doing is telling people to get real about where they can afford to live and provide resources to get them there. The author talked about waiting lists for affordable housing. What if instead of putting people on a waiting list for an apartment in Seattle, the housing authority said, ""Look, you're realistically never going to get an apartment here. You make $650/mo in disability. Here's a list of studios in Spokane, Tacoma, Vancouver, WA, et.al. We'll pay your deposit and first month's rent and give you a bus ticket there."" It would likely be a lot more helpful than what we have in place now. 

Here's a building in Spokane: $325/mo utilities included. http://spokane.craigslist.org/apa/5708864732.html I lived in Spokane for three years going to school. It's no great shakes but it beats suicide any day. $660/mo in disability; after rent, that leaves $335/mo for misc. expenses and he still has food stamps for groceries. It's not much, but it would be enough to scrape by on, which is what he was doing here in Seattle relying on free rent.

"Some facts on the funding proposal for ST3.  All information on ST3's funding proposal itself is taken from the ST3 Funding Background Report available [here](https://st32.blob.core.windows.net/media/Default/Document%20Library%20Featured/July_2016/ST3_Funding_070716.pdf)

* MVET fees, which are vehicle tab fees based on the vehicle's value, would be raised from 0.3% to 1.1% through at least 2028, or about $80 per year extra for a $10k car.  This would substantially increase vehicle tab fees, which are already [among the highest in the nation](http://www.ncsl.org/research/transportation/registration-and-title-fees-by-state.aspx).
* While Seattle's sales tax is already 9.6%, and [is the highest local sales tax in all major US cities](http://www.cheatsheet.com/money-career/10-major-cities-with-the-highest-sales-tax.html/?a=viewall), ST3 plans to appropriate funding by raising the sales tax a further 0.5% to 10.1%.  Keep in mind that sales taxes are [widely seen](http://time.com/money/3667280/unfair-taxes-washington-state/) as [regressive tax systems](http://www.seattletimes.com/business/economy/washington-suffers-most-regressive-tax-system-in-u-s/), and even fuel charges of [economic racism](http://www.seattleglobalist.com/2015/05/11/wa-state-regressive-tax-system-racist-capital-gains/36923).
* An additional property tax will be levied, equivalent to the $0.25/$1,000 assessed value tax also levied by [Seattle Proposition 1](http://www.kingcounty.gov/depts/elections/how-to-vote/ballots/whats-on-the-ballot/ballot-measures/august-primary/list-of-measures/seattle-prop-1.aspx), which passed earlier in August.  This levy is not limited to ""owned property"", which is to say that all land-users will face additional charges for the use of their property (including tenants, regardless of income).  Here are [two contrasting views](http://www.seattletimes.com/opinion/housing-levy-can-help-those-getting-priced-out-of-seattle/) on the initiative published in the [Seattle Times](http://www.seattletimes.com/opinion/renters-youll-pay-for-prop-1-lets-move-seattle-too/).
* Estimates of fare collection by Sound Transit on the proposed lines will only cover about 40% of light rail operations costs and 20% of transit bus operations costs.  While a rollback of levied taxes is legally required when the specified projects are completed, Sound Transit is not required to roll back taxes that fund maintenance and operations of these systems.  Sound Transit has not released long-term maintenance and operations cost estimates for ST3.

If a lane is narrow enough that a driver must cross the lane line to pass safely, then ""as far right as is safe"" is the center of the lane, to give drivers adequate warning that they're legally required to change lanes to pass.",,,,jmputnam,,,1472169300,t5_2qhad,t3_4zl0uj,t1_d6wq6m7,13,1473603384,0,0,d6wtmrp,Seattle,13,,

"I believe the theory is that once the wolves begin to learn to feed on the cattle, they'll keep doing it because its an easy kill for them. If left unchecked, they'll stop feeding on wildlife and remove themselves from the ecosystem. Wolves are smart and will eat what's easiest once they've learned how to do it. Why chase a deer when there are hamburgers lying around everywhere? So the DFW decides it has to remove them from the ecosystem before they pass on the cattle-grazing habit to the rest of their pack, their offspring, or other packs. The decision isn't a few cows vs. the wolves, it's the larger picture implications for allowing wolves to feed on livestock.

"I was born and raised here (in Ravenna), and moved back 5 months ago after spending ~8 years in undergrad and grad school in NYC and the bay area. I always planned to live in Seattle permanently, and just wanted to get a taste for life elsewhere. The whole time I was in school, I pinched every penny to save up for moving back here and buying a house to settle down. My whole family is here. Many of my friends are here.

Guess I should have skipped grad school and come back sooner, because I don't see how I can get a foothold financially. I have a good job and good future job prospects, but let's face it: I'm an engineer in academia, not in the private sector. I can't take the prospect of giving up the career that I've built just to pay the bills. Not to mention: I can't imagine that I'd be able to hire any good graduate students or postdocs here if they can't afford the rent. Same story as SF, just 6 years earlier in the evolution.

It also saddens me to see this formerly sleepy town taken over by the ""Jobs, Growth, Jobs, Growth"" monster. Yes, we could slow down the skyrocketing cost of living increases by re-zoning. Yes, light rail is amazing and ST3 will build on that. But I worry that we're not considering an alternative that avoids repeating the SF scenario, even if we manage to slow it. Why not throttle growth to give the city time to grow? I doubt it will happen, and if it doesn't I'll be sad to pack my bags and move to PDX/somewhere in Colorado/Utah/Idaho/Montana.

For the downtown area it can be hard to predict exactly where the congestion will be even when an event is planned at a specific area.  There might be a rally at Westlake Plaza, for example, and police suddenly decide to camp out on a certain side street (blocking some transit), or a group in the rally decides to go off on their own down some other street.  Then there's a chain reaction and buses streets away are affected.   

If they said ""Expect possible transit service delays on buses on 4th Ave near Westlake Plaza"" then people on 3rd Ave will start complaining when they encounter delays.

How can ""poor uneducated"" immigrants could be causing the housing storage in Seattle? LOL.

To liberals, the population of America exists to serve the government rather than our society existing on its own with government to help out here and there, so immigration is inherently good.*

Regardless of the timing, someone comes out and clears that encampment. What then? Where do those people go? Are their belongings confiscated? Are their tents &amp; sleeping bags confiscated?

If that same homeless person sets up another camp a few blocks away, is there punishment for repeat offenders? What is it? Maybe a $100 fine for the first offense? Should we send them to jail after that?",,,,rabidfurby,,,1472580941,t5_2qhad,t3_50c03c,t1_d72rv4z,-25,1473682623,0,0,d72wjka,Seattle,-25,,

"Lets point all the blame at the disabled person and excuse the greedy corporate holding companies. I'd love to see people like you utter this false dichotomy shit after becoming disabled.

Landlord was a corporate holding company that bought out ma and pop and were  going to jack up the rent and kick the disabled person to the curb, into homelessness. It's not ma and pop fault they had to sell, but it is a societal problem that this man's rent can be jacked up and he can be forced onto the streets by a corporate holding company that doesn't give a shit about the community they are impacting. If you had bothered to read it you'd realize my problem wasn't with ma and pop, it's the corporate holding company-  they are the landlord in this story that need to be held accountable, maybe you misunderstood my second explanation yet again, or maybe it was intentional misunderstanding to misconstrue my argument, build a straw man and argue against that instead of my acutely position... Not sure what you think you're proving here to be honest...


CA has much better rent control than WA. In WA those laws are heavily slanted in favor of the owners.

For some to get rich others must suffer that's how capitalism works. If you don't acknowledge that fact, that housing bubbles are horrible for  vulnerable members of society, you're coming off as one of those head in the sand conservative moron types who doesn't care about other people, shrug and say not my problem types.

According to you, there are no victims, just lazy people who didn't bootstraps hard enough right?

If this law were in place I would of had to have rented to them because they were first to apply instead I rented to a young couple that were invested in the neighborhood and worked at local non profits.

"I've worked as a ~~contractor~~ vendor for Amazon for almost 6 years in a position where I've been able to see tons of different arms of the company.  In a few weeks, my team is being absorbed by Amazon and I couldn't be happier.  I know what the job will entail and I know how demanding it's going to be. 

The problem, I think, is one of entitlement.  This is totally a generalization, as we all have to understand that with a company this big, there will be parts that don't function at a level we all might want it to, but it really does seem like a great place to work for the right type of people.

If you're someone who just wants to pay the bills at 40 hours a week, and wants to be able to work for 8 hours and then go home and not think about it, Amazon is not going to be for you.  This company demands a lot from their employees, but they offer wonderful compensation as well.

&gt; Uncontaminated soil contains lead concentrations less than 50 ppm but soil lead levels in many urban areas exceed 200 ppm. (AAP 1993)

&gt; The EPA's standard for lead in bare soil in play areas is 400 ppm by weight and 1200 ppm for non-play areas. This regulation applies to cleanup projects using federal funds.

50 ppm is 50,000 ppb and 16,400 ppb is pretty far below that threshold. So this soil sample easily clears the EPA standard for ""uncontaminated soil"".

**EDIT**

Wow, touched a nerve. Objections to my observation have all taken the form:

**Fuck you, Trump supporter!**

I am not a Trump supporter. I'm a Bernie supporter who supports a universal basic income and universal healthcare. At this point in the game, I believe there is no remaining candidate worth voting for. However, none of that matters, because my comment wasn't a political argument, but rather a cultural observation. Like it or not, it's become okay for mainstream outlets to body-shame Trump, but not Hillary. Good comments here:

**Trump is a bully, and bullies deserve to be bullied, fuck him!**

Perhaps Trump is a bully. Punch him in the nose, then - these figures, which clearly make the cultural statement that it's shameful to have an old man's body, it's shameful to have a small penis, it's shameful to have bad skin, it's shameful to have bad hair - aren't a punch in the nose for Trump, but rather a low-handed insult to a large swath of decent human beings.

It's disappointing to see that a large number of commenters believe that political discourse should fall to the level of the lowliest participant. ""He started it.""

"He seems to make 4 actual points about why ST3 might be bad. 1) Its a lot of money 2) Its a lot of money for families to have to pay years before the thing is built. 3) Not everyone will ride it. 4) self-driving cars will make it obsolete

There is truth to those points. But what's crazy is that this sleaze can't even get past his first editorial without intentionally misrepresenting the facts that surround the actually valid points that support his cause.

1) Its a lot of money -- Yes $54 billion is a lot of money. Buts its not anywhere close to the ""entire budget for the state"" over the decades that the $54B will be collected and spent over. That's a misleading apples to oranges comparison. 

2) Its tax money being collected from people before it can be utilized -- Well, yes. That's how taxes work. And we're also collecting gas and property taxes today for infrastructure projects that won't be started for decades, too. There isn't any difference here between road infrastructure funding and rail infrastructure funding.

3) Not everyone will use it.  Well, I don't use I-405, but I have to help pay for that too. 75,000 people use ST's system every day already. I can imagine that number would at least quadruple when ST3 is built.  Last time I checked, 300,000 people is not a ""tiny percentage"" of the metro population.

Don’t come back**,” Crawford said.When asked **why he picked Seattle**, Crawford said **his friends** had called this the **“land of opportunity.’**““

&gt;There’s a lot of angels up here. A **lot of love**. People buying people brand new tents, **giving** them blankets, putting food in their stomachs,” he said. 

&gt;On Friday, a homeless man named Steve told KIRO 7 he was given a bus ticket to come to **Seattle from Phoenix**.

&gt;He said he told the Phoenix location of St. Vincent de Paul that he wanted to come to Seattle where he has relatives. **They** purchased the ticket for him, ***but he admits now he does not actually have family here***. 

&gt;Steve said he has a much better chance of surviving in Seattle, **compared to** Phoenix. He said he wanted a change in scenery, and he preferred the weather here. He added, “You can never starve in this town, **everyone feeds you**.”   Seattle is the “land of opportunity” … for enabling homeless people.

Portland Oregon doing the same:

&gt;The city of Portland began a pilot program Thursday, to buy one-way bus tickets for homeless people who approach agency staff to say that they have family to stay with in another city. The pilot is set to be completed at the end of June.
 
&gt;On Thursday, the city paid for the first two bus tickets, with destinations of Seattle and Spokane.

As a father of children with multiple health issues that require quite a lot of working with the school, I know a thing or two about it. It sounds like you have a shit school doing shit things - or your are too unwilling or too lazy to actually hold them to task for work to find an alternative.

Like literally the simplest alternative available, that is not a DIY kit at all, but another brand of fast auto-injection epinephrine that costs about 1/6th as much as a ""Brand Name"" epi-pen.

http://www.consumerreports.org/drugs/how-to-get-cheaper-epipen-alternative/

Being in Washington, the pharmacist can even substitute the name brand for this alternative.

Maybe instead of putting your head in the sand and kow-towing to the ""powers that be"", you should do some research. You know, like an adult, like a parent should.

"Please don't buy all of the fear-mongering about the animal shelters. I can't speak to the Kirkland shelter, but I'm a volunteer at the Seattle Animal Shelter on 15th Ave downtown, and the only time they euthanize is when the animal has a medical condition they are unlikely to recover from, or if the animal has been proven to be a danger to other people or animals. We have over a 95% placement rate.

The shelter is a wonderful place for these animals in between homes - they are well fed, socialized and walked at least twice a day (3 times MWF), given toys and beds, and in general have everything they need.

Almost all of the animals leave the shelter happier and healthier than when they came in. There's a pitty downtown right now named Ronald who could barely walk when he was brought in a few weeks ago, and now walks miles a day with wagging tail and kisses the whole way.

There's been talk of some big stuff downtown for cycling but much of that has been backpedaled on due to lack of funding and the desire for...........more studies.

As for traffic remedies, in general, it's complicated and expensive. Congestion is a a simple geometric problem of too many cars in too small of space. Unless we pour billions into widening I-5 and level neighborhoods to widen arterials, there isn't much that can be done. While unpopular, based on world-wide evidence in cities like Singapore, Stockholm, London, and Milan; congestion charging Downtown Seattle would reduce traffic by 10%-20%, make everything free-flowing again, improve safety, and clean up the air.

"Meh, real estate prices will drop (and won't drop until) when AMZN starts to drop. The stock is massively overvalued right now which led to thousands of their local employees cashing in their RSU (restricted stock units, essentially shares of AMZN that slowly become yours as you work for Amazon for an extended period of time) for ridiculous profits which then get reinvested into the housing market.

Seriously, just look at a chart of AMZN over the [last five years](https://www.google.com/finance?chdnp=1&amp;chdd=1&amp;chds=1&amp;chdv=1&amp;chvs=maximized&amp;chdeh=0&amp;chfdeh=0&amp;chdet=1471904195003&amp;chddm=501262&amp;chls=IntervalBasedLine&amp;q=NASDAQ:AMZN&amp;ntsp=0&amp;ei=v3m7V5ikG4KoigLegr2wCQ), for example a software engineer may typically receive around 150 RSUs upon being hired which five years ago would be worth about $27,000 however with the climb in share price those units are now worth $114,000 and can be sold for cash (minus capital gains tax). What we've been seeing for the past few years and especially the last two or so years has been long-term Amazon employees being able to cash out their RSUs and ending up with large windfalls that can be used for large down payments or even cash offers on houses depending on how many units they received.",,,,kosha,,,1471904116,t5_2qhad,t3_4z2c9m,t3_4z2c9m,14,1473546718,0,0,d6sgisx,Seattle,14,,

I'm almost certain that my neighbors are prolific bike thieves. I live in East Lake in an older apartment building, and there's a couple(?) that lives below me that take up a large portion of the communal basement storage with an unbelievable amount of bicycles and parts. There's at least 10 bicycles they have chained up there, with new ones coming and going. They have wheels and tires all over the place, various parts etc. Some of the bikes look really expensive. I probably would not have noticed or cared if they weren't taking up so much of the basement, but they are and the few times I've interacted with them they seem shady, especially for how nice of an area it is.

"I'm a homeowner in Phinney Ridge, and I would LOVE for it to change.  It gives me an opportunity to use an investment I bought 4 years ago to cover it's own cost and actually make me some money.  It's the people who have the time to go to community meetings/neighborhood councils who are shouting about not wanting change, but if we brought it up for a vote, I think you'd find that a large portion of the city would find it palatable to allow duplexes/triplexes/stacks on single family lots.

"I don't work at Amazon, but I'm pretty sure ""Amazon Prime Web Services"" isn't a real thing.  Amazon Web Services (AWS) is, but I can't picture why that service would be desperate to hire a graphic designer immediately given what they do and how big they already are.  It also doesn't jive with what I know of their normal hiring practices which are extensive and involve onsite half/full day interviews.  

I've been a tech recruiter for almost a decade now and I've never heard of anything like this hiring practice, and the made up name of the group at Amazon makes me think it's even fishier.  My only thought  that this isn't a scam is that sometimes people are super irrational/immature when they leave their current job because -- 

a) they're nervous and avoid the confrontation of telling their current job they're leaving until the last possible second

b) exaggerate details of the new job to make them sound better or make their employer less mad about why they left

c) they hate their job and just quit when they hit a breaking point and made something up to explain why

"lol. From a comment I made last week about /r/Seattle tropes:

&gt; Also, I'm renting a car and thinking of taking a day trip to see Mt. Rainier, Portland, and the Olympic National Park. What's the best route to cover all those in one day?

Your itinerary is completely unrealistic. Break out Google Maps and look at times and driving distances.

Where are you planning on going within Olympic National Park? Ask Google to give you driving directions assuming it's a day trip that you're starting and ending in Tacoma. You're going to spend more time in your car than you will hiking around.

Next, you're going to drive from Tacoma in the morning, go to a Huskies game, do other tourist shit in Seattle, *then* drive to Vancouver BC?

The ferries for the San Juans leave from Anacortes and only happen a few times a day. Reservations are more or less required. You think you're going to drive down from Vancouver, catch a ferry, hang out in the San Juans, harass some orcas, take a ferry back, then drive back to Seattle, all in one day?

You're going to be stuck in your rental car for half your trip, and constantly hurrying to get to your next destination. Maybe that's an east coast thing, because that's not my kind of vacation.",,,,rabidfurby,,,1470608724,t5_2qhad,t3_4wmyer,t3_4wmyer,17,1473277293,0,0,d68arjn,Seattle,17,,

"The in city lines will be as much subway as any line in the country that is a subway. The far far suburban stretches are more like light rail. Basically, Sound Transit probably (And hopefully) is not going to repeat their mistake with MLK again. 

Other than that, the ballard line alone is supposed to bring in like 120,000 new riders systemwide or something? So I dunno where you're getting 50K. West Seattle line will probably bring in 50K, and Tacoma and Everett together should probably be around 60-70. (I might be misremembering this, but I think I'm at least close). I don't remember at all how many people the issaquah line is supposed to serve but I imagine its not too few. probably 25K or something. I hope.   By the time ST3 is built out they expect 500-600K/day system wide IIRC. (which is 50% more than BART carries today, on about the same track-mileage) Actually, that's also 50% more than KC Metro busses carry today too. and is equivalent roughly to the entire regional transit ridership in a day.

It also includes BRT on 405 that's supposed to bring 15,000 riders a day, and more sounder service (unspecified).

I mean, there's a couple things I'd rather see them do than build to Everett and Tacoma, like Build a line down Denny and off into the central district, and the Ballard-UW line proposed by Seattle Subway, but alas, it is a regional plan and it has to get 3 counties to vote for it, so it serves everyone. 


I'd also like to see them build a line around the lake, which I acknowledge would be very expensive, but I think it would make a much better backbone to the system than a Tacoma-Everett ""Spine"" But that's just me. I mean, I think a lot more people would ride from renton to bellevue, and renton to Seattle than Federal Way/Tacoma-&gt; Seattle. And a round-lake line would be easy to spur off of (to places like F.W., Kent, Issaquah, (I don't know the north end of the lake as well but I'm sure there's places).

This change should provide researchers with a more varied and robust supply of marijuana. At present, there is only one entity authorized to produce marijuana to supply researchers in the United States: the University of Mississippi, operating under a contract with NIDA. Consistent with the CSA and U.S. treaty obligations, DEA’s new policy will allow additional entities to apply to become registered with DEA so that they may grow and distribute marijuana for FDA-authorized research purposes.

This change illustrates DEA’s commitment to working together with the FDA and NIDA to facilitate research concerning marijuana and its components. DEA currently has 350 individuals registered to conduct research on marijuana and its components. Notably, DEA has approved

"&gt; In the ten years before the 2015 redesign of the southern segment of 35th Avenue SW, nearly 500 collisions occurred between SW Roxbury Street and SW Morgan Street. An average of one pedestrian was involved in a crash annually, some years having as many as 4 pedestrians were involved in crashes. There were 9 serious injuries and 1 fatality collision in that 10 year period.

&gt; Since the roadway was redesigned, zero pedestrians have been involved in crashes, there have been zero serious injury or fatal collisions, and there have been 45 total collisions. The roadway redesign is improving safety on the corridor.

However, it looks like they are comparing 10-years prior to 11-months after (see page 2).

45 collisions in 11 months is ~491 collisions in 10-years, and an average of one pedestrian incident per year is too small a sample to know in 11-months if there is improvement. Surely there were plenty of stretches of &gt;= 11-months in the previous 10-years in which there were no pedestrian incidents if the average was 1/year.

Two reasons: 1) I am a data-driven person and I want to see exactly how my usage ebbs and flows, preferably from the source versus either putting current draw clamps on my service feeders (unsafe unless the meter is pulled, inaccurate if the device isn't calibrated) or depending on the ""blinking LED"" of most electronic meters (inaccurate under several circumstances).

Second, I hope that SCL will be able to begin offering time-of-day use rates.  For example, a [Texas electric company offers ""free nights""](http://freenights.txu.com/) where a 9-hour period--and the start time can be selected by the customer--is not subject to usage charges.  It encourages people to move their electrical use load to the off-peak times for the grid.  (In Texas, this is more of a concern because A/C sucks up a lot of electrons and is usually used when the grid is under its highest load.)

"If you or anyone else wants to read a really great book on the subject look for ""The World Without Us"" by Alan Weisman.  It's an excellent read.  He goes places where there suddenly weren't people anymore such as Chernobyl. He also interviews people who keep our infrastructure from breaking down, like the guy that keeps the NYC subways from flooding.

All and all an excellent read.  According to that book, it would take much less time than you would think.  If one house caught fire and there weren't firemen, than the fire could spread.  Sewer drains would clog with no one to clear the leaves from them, and then the water would run overland to the Puget Sound again, slowly washing away a bunch of things with it.  With no upkeep moisture would rot the buildings from the inside out.

"Thanks u/cetacean_sensation for the market overview - I wanted to take a moment and add some comments as well.  BTW, Dave Parker, CEO Code Fellows... easy to find here or social media. Feel free to reach out. 

Everyone wants a great salary - but not everyone should go into our industry. The work is hard and getting into the industry is a lot of work. We run a one day Code 101 ($99 including meals). The goal of that is to filter people out, show them what a long day looks like. We also segmented our programs into 4+4+10 weeks so that you didn’t have to commit 18-20 weeks before you know if you actually like the work. 

I don’t think their is a special gene for coding. But it’s a s^%*ton of work and a new set of skills needs to be combined with real life experiences to help get a good job. There are three profiles of people that take this type of program. 
 - Stack switchers - people with previous coding experience - maybe CS school, maybe self-taught that want to move to a more current tech stack. They get placed the quickest with the best comp 
 - The middle of the bell curve is a 31 year old with a degree and work experience that is switching industries - still good comp - but it’s combining life with skills 
 - College Alternative - minimal life experience. If you’ve been working retail or never worked in the industry you need to give this a hard look before you spend the money. We can give you skills - but you can’t buy experience. This is the hardest group to place. 

Ultimately you’re going to have to get out and do the networking - because hitting the “easy button” on Indeed.com isn’t going to get you a job. The industry can give you current skills but no one is waiting outside the school’s doors waiting to hire you, you still have to go find the job. 

We’ve been working with industry partners on how the industry reports out the data. Some schools count internships as job placement - they aren’t! Some want to report placement at the time-frame that makes them look best - I disagree. We’ve moved to reporting the data every six months, it’s not easy but it’s the right thing to do and the industry needs to get real. 
 -  ur average grad is placed at 11 weeks 
 - Average scholarship grads (women, minority, veterans) are at five weeks 
 - At six months across the programs we’re &gt;90%
 - Average starting salary is $71k 
     - Second job or promotion bumps the salary to $82k, at 9 months 

What have I learned in my first year here? For profit schools have earned a bad reputation for a reason (don't get me started on Universities/cost/placement rates). Ultimately a year from now we’re going to see programs that are focused on placement rates and those that are focussed on selling their programs. That compression is good for the consumer and the industry. Have a question? Happy to help.",,,,daveparkersea,,,1470160227,t5_2qhad,t3_4vqn0v,t3_4vqn0v,11,1473157827,0,0,d61apkl,Seattle,11,,

"&gt;Well for one thing, do you think Seattle has better police than Louisiana, where cops make $12/hr? I do. That's a product of being unionized.

New Orleans *has* a police union.  Don't know about the rest of Lousiana, but as NO is the largest city, I think it makes the point soundly enough.  If you're implying that Louisiana police are shit, then it would seem that unionization isn't what makes police better.

I think that's Seattle's police are better because of lots of reasons.  Being unionized may be one of them.  Then again, it may not.

&gt;For another, imagine the Mayor could fire any cop he wanted for any reason or no reason

You're presenting a false dichotomy.  It's not as if unions and ""fuck it, I'll fire whoever I want"" are the other two options.  You could just as readily have an accountability board that is made up of (just for example) the mayor, the police chief, two police officers, and three members of the public, and that board could be the group that makes personnel decisions.

"&gt; I do not see how this is seen as a luxury though and not considered smart planning.

You've now arrived at the intersection of two goals: Moving people around a city *and* enabling people to be able to afford to live in that city.

Parking spaces and structures cost a lot of money.  Building parking either costs to bury it and build the same number of units above ground (thus making those units more expensive) or costs in sacrificing the number or size of units built in order to put the parking on the surface (thus making the number of units built be less than could have been, making the remainder more expensive).

Seattle's policy is that, for multi-family or other non-SFH (single family housing) zones, parking is not a requirement as long as the building is located within 1/4 mile of all-day, frequent transit (defined as a bus or light rail vehicle arriving a minimum of every 15 minutes between 7am and 7pm).  Nearby access to frequent transit is supposed to substitute for having a personal vehicle and, thus, negate the need for some or all of the parking.

Personally, I am fine with this policy.  I live ""carfree,"" in that I use transit for almost all of my trips but I also have ZipCar, car2Go, and ReachNow memberships for the gaps.  (I also have a bicycle.)  I only wanted a driveway for future possibilities and because it makes my house more valuable in terms of resale.

Parking is becoming--and should become, in my mind--an a la carte service.  If you want it, you pay for it.  The expectation should not be that the public right of way is used for storage of privately-owned and exclusive-use vehicles.",,,,somenewuser,Central Area,,1471246841,t5_2qhad,t3_4xse4p,t1_d6i23b2,35,1473411954,0,0,d6i28m9,Seattle,35,,flair

Here's what I have gathered:

It's tough to meet people. Most people work long, odd hours in a variety of fields and often don't have the same days off. So most of the time meet ups are less regular things and more excited ""fuck yes, we have the same day/time off"".

However, once you have found your group/click you're pretty much set. 

I think a lot of people expect people to want to hang out with them. So make it so, offer hang outs, bar meet ups, hiking trips, festival stuff, etc. Invite people you want to befriend and don't be wary about being rejected about it constantly.

"With the amount of time OP must spend around police officers to be on a first name basis, he should know that police often have people sit down during Terry stops. This provides several advantages to the officer:

The individual can't simply walk away, which might necessitate grabbing and restraining them, and turn into a use of force. 

If the individual decides to fight or run, they first must stand up, allowing the officer time to react. 

OP ought to also know that SPD typically responds to events with multiple officers. I believe the thinking behind this approach is more officers encourage compliance and discourage resistance, again, hopefully reducing the need for force to be used for the officers to do their jobs. 

OP doesn't like cops and editorializes his blog heavily. It sounds like officers ask the guy to sit multiple times before he finally does. We can't hear the questions asked, but I'd be curious what OP thought was ""threatening"" about them. 

Seated guy appears a little amped up, repeatedly clapping his hands, gesturing and repeatedly extending and pulling his legs in and out.

"Yeah, Cedar's scammer has been around for awhile - he's also the same person who has been pulling knives on people in the University District. There's posts about him in both /r/seattle and /r/udub (search for ""psa knife"" and ""scammer""). He's about 5'8'', looks ... I guess you would say Russian? Someone else posted that he looks vaguely like Putin, which I think is accurate. Late 30's, early 40's. He's not totally bald, but thinning on top. When he's running his scam he affects a bit of an accent, which I think is either made up or he's able to turn it on &amp; off. He dresses up for the scam as well - I've seen him wear a button-up, long sleeve shirt and slacks, with a jacket slung over his arm. He's trying to appear respectable/presentable. I've run into him both when he's doing his scam, and when he's gone ballistic, so I'm positive it's the same person (yes, I called the police - he took off, and apparently they didn't find him). He didn't have a knife on him when he went off on me, but he kept on repeating that he would get one to slice me up &amp; kill me. My best guess is this dude is feeding a meth addiction (or some other street drug) - he runs the scam because he can't keep a job. His aggression and paranoia could be from staying awake on meth for too long ... though I'm just speculating. If not drugs, then he's mentally ill. He's definitely far more dangerous than the normal panhandlers.

"[This comment someone left on the editorial:](http://crosscut.com/2016/08/on-making-the-best-argument-against-sound-transit-expansion/#comment-2828508824)

&gt; The attitude of “if it does not help me then why should I pay for it,” is a terminal attitude for society. Why should I pay for schools, I have no children in them, or why should I pay for police, I don’t need them I can protect myself. This is the policy of Tim Eyman. I pay for light rail because perhaps once a year I use it, but everyday many use it and it reduces
the increase of traffic on our streets. Tim Eyman’s view is just another embodiment of both Donald Trump and the infamous movie character Gordon Gecko.

&gt; Much of what I pay for taxes does not improve my immediate lifestyle. Perhaps it never will, but it will serve the greater good. When one pays a water bill, the money does not just take care of immediate needs, it pays for future improvement. Perhaps Tim Eyman can do without water at his home in Mukilteo. When you look back to the original Metro, the cost per household was beyond anybody’s imagination. Of course if we would have had a Tim Eyman at that time, we would still be living with poop floating in Elliot Bay and Lake Washington.

&gt; Two things I have learned in life; As a Catholic and being educated to some degree by Jesuits, it was drummed into me “for the greater good.” I was also taught by my parents that “nothing in life is free.” Both ideas seem to be missing from Tim Eyman’s lexicon. It is becoming rather repulsive to listen to Tim Eyman’s third grade rant of “I don’t want to pay for it.” I say third grade because that is the way most third graders think, selfish and all about me, of course by the time they reach high school, most have matured out of that mindset. It is too bad that Tim Eyman has not matured. Please think beyond your immediate satisfaction.

&gt; I have learned that Tim Eyman is an adoptee according to his bio. Where would he be if his adopting family had followed his philosophy of ""if it doesn't help me, then why do it?” Perhaps he would still be a homeless street urchin in Yakima, who knows. However, someone did look beyond themselves and spent money they did not have to spend on something that might never do them any good and adopted him. Now I know three adoptees, and Tim Eyman is the only one who has such a selfish mindset.",,,,AmericanDerp,Brougham Faithful,,1470855056,t5_2qhad,t3_4x3pdo,t3_4x3pdo,70,1473330117,0,0,d6c65i4,Seattle,70,,flair

"The recent efforts to relocate and engage people in The Jungle displaced some residents to Ranier, where there are several convenient and relatively quiet areas to camp in tent, trailer, and vehicle. There is a string of homeless enclaves from Ranier Ave @ I-90 down to Renton and many services/conveniences. The trash piles up because humans generate waste but homeless people generally don't have convenient access to disposal services. 

It takes a lot of effort to first realize a problem, have the problem be recognized by people that matter, then allocate resources to solve it.

Good. If not now, it would anyway when you got here.

Walmart. Definitely Walmart. Do yourself a favor and try to transfer to a store out here so you have a job and income.

I transferred to a store out here from Home Office. I have 5 years in tech with several promotions and recognitions on the way. I've had a few phone interviews, but the hiring process here is fuckin insane. 

&gt;I'm certainly not dumb by any standard...And I'm a lot more meticulous with the details than to just barrel in head first or, as you so eloquently said, fly blind into a hurricane without a parachute. 

Yeah, that's not me at all. I did hella research and could tell you tons of shit about this city and the geography and everything. When I talk to locals they're surprised I know so much about the area.

I still was stupid (desperate? I hated Arkansas) enough to move out here with less than $1000. The time it took to find a room to rent found me unable to actually pay the deposit and application fee so I'm stuck in my car for the time being.

&gt;I'm pretty determined to find a way. If you can't lean into your dreams, what are you aiming for in life?

I'm fucking posting from my car in some random lot. I'm also happier than I've ever been in my life. I gave up my good paying office job for overnight retail, gave up my house and social circle and almost all my belongings to start over in a city 2000 mi away from what was ""home"" (Seattle is my home now).

"You're kidding, right?  Trying to set a record for downvotes?  Attempting to embody everything that people who love Seattle loathe about clueless newcomers who just don't get it?  Because you're doing one heck of a job here.

This is Seattle.  It is not the east coast.  It is not a suburban sprawl of chain restaurants and malls and big box stores.  There are a lot of things that even the most passionate Seattleites will admit could be better here.  The lack of chain restaurants is not one of them.

When you move to a new city, it's widely agreed that the best approach to settling in and learning about your new home is not to whine about all the ways it's not like the place you left....because you left there, and came here, right?  Instead, how about taking a step or two out of your comfort zone, and trying to learn a little about what so many people love about Seattle--and its restaurant scene in particular?  If you give it a chance, you might actually find some new things you like.  At worst, you'll sound less like an ignorant git who calls anything s/he doesn't understand ""artsy fartsy"" or ""out of touch with reality"" (your reality, maybe...but your reality is not everyone else's).

If you've tried, and you just don't like the dining options you're finding, try venturing off of Capitol Hill--you'll find vastly different restaurants within ten or fifteen miles in any direction (I just counted over 25 major national or regional chain restaurants on a mile-and-a-half stretch of Southcenter Parkway in Tukwila).  Or, if you simply cannot live without those incomparable east coast chains, and can't find anything to your tastes here to take their place...then leave.

Now the issue I am conflicted on is where that balance of protection vs needed change and reform is. It is very obvious that police reform is needed, more civilian oversight is a big part of that. It is just the simple truth, you need to have people watching over the police force to make sure abuses are not being made. But at the same time the police need the union for their own protection.

"After some quick Googling, I couldn't find what liquefaction countermeasures were actually implemented, but here's a [UW study] (https://faculty.washington.edu/dersh/Files/Project2009/AlaskanWay.pdf) of the geology and risk of liquefaction (search for ""grout"").

 
&gt;• Calls for tunnel to be constructed within dense glacial till, well
below liquefiable soils and away from seawall.

&gt;• Liquefiable soil present at south approach.

&gt;* Deep-soil mixing with jet grout would increase the density and
strength while greatly reducing the permeability of the soil.
This is very expensive but effective proven effective. (Big Dig)

&gt;• Slurry walls at south approach would extend downwards to
100 feet or more below grade, thus subjecting them to
significant lateral loads due to earth and hydrostatic
pressure.

The project is moving along a lot faster now because it's digging through that ""dense glacial till"", which is much more ideal for the tunneling machine to dig through.

&gt;“Coming out of the launch pit, the contractor was in loose, hydraulically-placed fill. The Denny Regrade, if you will: the old estuary deposits, old man-made fill. So the ground was much softer, wetter, looser. When they got to about King Street the face of the machine was fully into this over-consolidated glacial, hard soil. And that makes conditions much easier to manage,” Sowers said.
&gt;More than 1,000 feet later, Bertha is in the middle of the kind of soil the machine was designed for: hard glacial till and packed clay.

"A few things:

1.  You're absolutely right that case workers are over-taxed and under-funded. They aren't given the appropriate resources (or the appropriate resources fast enough, because bureaucracy) to properly give the kids in the system the care they deserve. It's tragic.

2.  Whatever you do, **don't support foster care charities.**  I'm sure there are some good ones, but they should all be shut down.  They're plagued with myriad issues, most notably they're not subject to the same scrutiny that the state workers are. When kids from a private agency die in care,  there tends to be an investigation by the police, a lump-sum check to the foster parents for the pay they would have received over the rest of the kid's time in care, and then an immediate NDA signed between the agency and the parents. No publication. No press. No investigation from the agency.   When kids die in state care, sometime WILL lose their job, and typically someone is arrested for negligence. There is also press coverage, because the state is transparent about issues in the system, which results in increased pressure to fix whatever went so tragically wrong.        Additionally, charities pay better and limit the caseload for workers, so they steal the good caseworkers and leave the better (state) program with lower quality workers.

3.  One of the reasons good social workers are so hard to come by is because of the stringent requirements for becoming a social worker. No one usually goes to college intending to go into social work, which means that when the state institutes requirements like ""must have a bachelor's in social work or human care"" (which they do; you *must* specialize your education in social work to become a social worker), they cut out a lot of good candidates. I'm really not sure where you got the ""practically anyone who applies"" bit, but you're dead wrong.  It's a restrictive hiring process for a thankless job that offers low pay.  That's why it's so hard to get good social workers.

The best thing you can do is lobby your representatives and elected officials to better fund state social workers.  If case workers had decent pay and the necessary resources, they could actually provide the necessary care these kids need.  Private agencies are corrupt and abusive, and are absolutely *not* the answer here. We **must** better fund human services.

"You nailed most of the talking points I've heard.

From the conservative crowd, these are the types of arguments:

- ST3 is too expensive (""billion with a B!"")
- Rail moves too few people for too much money (""But I *need* to drive!"")
- Rail doesn't meaningfully reduce congestion (""Just look at the last 10 years!"")
- Bus Rapid Transit is quicker to deploy and just as effective (""but hey, when that BRT-only funding measure comes up, don't count on me. And those I-405 transit-only lanes? Socialism."")
- It won't help me, so why should I vote for it? (forgetting that almost everything in life falls in the same category)
- New technologies will make it obsolete by the time we finish (but when you actually run the numbers, it's clear self-driving cars are no panacea)

From the liberal crowd, I've heard these types of things:

- We shouldn't waste our money building rail to the suburbs. We should wait for a Seattle-only thing that serves Ballard/the central district/Fremont/SLU/etc. (never going to happen for political/structural reasons)
- ST3 ties-up state funding that should go to education (bunch of malarky)
- The proposed tax structure is regressive (maybe... but so is requiring everyone to have a car)
- Too much is being spent on parking garages (I'm actually sympathetic to this complaint, but I see the other side as well)

From the armchair crowd:

- I want it now! I'll be old/moved away/dead by the time it's finished! (but think of the children!)

"&gt;The downvotes aren't because Seattle is anti-gun

Is  that  so? Please  make  a  post  advocating  responsible  gun  ownership, or  at  the  very  least, some thing  that  isn't  explicitly anti  gun  in  this  sub  and  see  how  it's  treated. 

&gt;The downvotes are because you came into a thread with absolutely no mention of guns anywhere, and assumed that there is a large push against firearms. 

So violent  crime prevention and  gun  ownership  has  no relation? Probably  not  if  your  own  personal biases  get  in  the  way  of  rational  thought. Would this  woman  have  been  able  to  prevent  being  beaten  and  almost  raped  if  she  pulled  a  gun  on  the  would-be  rapist? Probably. Would  she  have  had  her  arm  broken  by  a  potential  rapist  who  directly  told  her (as  per  the  article) ""I'm  going  to  kill  you"" if  she  had  a  firearm? What  if  the  person  that  heard  her  screaming  wasn't  there  to  help  her  escape? But  you're right, firearms ownership  and  self  defense  in  potentially  deadly  situations  are  completely  unrelated. How  clueless  of  me  to  assume  they  did.

&gt;You constructed a condescending strawman that was completely irrelevant. That's why you got downvoted.

No, I  got  downvoted  because  of  a  small  but  loud  minority  of  confused  people  like  yourself  who  refuse  to  allow  themselves  to  believe  responsible  firearm  ownership  would  have probably prevented  this  situation.

Meanwhile, this  violent  criminal  is  still  on  the  prowl, free  to  do  as  he  pleases. If  it  we're  your  wife, sister, or mother who was almost raped, actually beaten and had her arm broken by this guy, would you still advocate for her to not have a firearm?

I garuntee you, if you or a loved one is in a horrible situation like what happened to the woman in article, you might reconsider your anti  gun bias. But  when  you're  being  violently  assaulted, the ""woe  is  me, I  should've bought  teh gun"" thoughts  are  a  little  too  late.

"Not all cyclists agree -- there's actually quite a divide in the cycling community.

Many bicycle-specific projects make streets more comfortable for novice riders, more vulnerable users, parents riding with children, etc.  But the same infrastructure is often less safe for experienced riders who know how to avoid the most common conflicts riding in traffic.

When Copenhagen started installing cycletracks like this decades ago, they studied the impact and found somewhat of an increase in crash rates for cyclists, but a **huge** increase in the number of cyclists.  Since cycling is much safer than driving, you get a net public health benefit from the increased bicycle mode share, even if it makes a small number of existing cyclists less safe.

Washington is an interesting case, because bike lanes are entirely optional here -- there's no legal requirement for more experienced cyclists to use a bike lane or sidepath if they prefer the safety of the street.  So there's less intense opposition here than you find in places like California where bike lanes are mandatory.  (California cyclists got one ""win"" on that score -- their law now officially says cycletracks are not bike lanes, they're separate facilities from the street, so they're not mandatory-use.)",,,,jmputnam,,,1471300659,t5_2qhad,t3_4xuegy,t1_d6iqlb4,10,1473423377,0,0,d6ixk7e,Seattle,10,,

"route and job stuff aside, some tips you've probably heard before, and maybe some you haven't:

* full fenders, decent lights (never set front light to blinky). rear lights with built in reflectors are a nice insurance policy for when your rear light dies unexpectedly (it will die unexpectedly). 
* well stocked saddle bag (patch kit, pump/co2, spare tube, tire levers, multi tool, chain breaker for bonus points)
* keep your drive train lubed. it takes less than 30 seconds once a week. won't last long in winter, and squeaky squeaky will slowly suck away your will to live.
* winter will suck a little, but try to learn to love the damp as a way to keep you cool. get some decent winter cycling gloves (the wool defeets are good) and don't wear dumb clothes (jeans, flannel...). old wool cycling jerseys are great for the winter. if it's not absolutely frigid, basic thin soccer shorts are great, you'll warm up very fast on that climb. mega bonus points: breakaway pants like it's 1995 for the ferry.
* clothing that keeps the drizzle out tends to keep the sweat in. just embrace it. 
* shower at work is a huge plus, but regardless, keep a full set of clothes at work. shit happens. can't have enough socks. 
* clipless shoes/pedals (i.e. the kind that you clip into) make climbing much, much easier. There's a bunch of different formats, but SPDs are a good place to start.
* resist the temptation to buy an e-bike unless you have a really good reason. just don't.
* get some decent, burly roadish tires. vittoria randonneurs, schwalbe marathons, continental gatorskins are good options.
* in a year or so you'll be so fucking fit--be prepared for non-stop sexual solicitation. don't skimp on a cable lock for your pants, you'll want a real deal u-lock. also get one for bike, i guess, and lock it up proper (sheldon brown method with a non-quick-release front wheel skewer should be fine so long as you don't have some fancy ass wheel set). of course, bring your bike inside if you can.
* get a comfortable saddle. it doesn't have to be fancy, and it might take a couple tries, but find one you like. parts bins at bikeworks/recycled cycles/bikery is a good place to look. squishy != good.
* don't let your brakes go to shit, even for one day. front brake especially. 
* if you start getting zits on your butt, apply bag balm early, before they become angry saddle sores.

"As a North Seattle Realtor I'm horrified to hear that the agent you consulted gave you some of that information. Recommending that someone forgo an inspection is bad advice for so many reasons. Did he say instead that you should do a pre-inspection? Those will cover the same things that an inspection would, you just conduct them before you even offer and then you (hopefully) know what you're getting yourself into when you go to offer on the home. If he advised that you shouldn't do any inspection whatsoever he's opening himself (or, his brokerage more likely) to major liability if you'd then buy a home with that advice and find major defects after the fact. Also, the deposit is referred to as earnest money within the industry. Your earnest money is essentially a good faith showing that you will buy the home. Generally, the only reasons you would not get your earnest money back should the transaction fall through would be if the transaction fell through because you got cold feet, or because you had waived a contingency which would have allowed you to get out of the transaction.

"&gt;I left a lot of details out of the story...

Then you should not be surprised when someone comes to a different conclusion than you when you have not provided all the facts.

I will judge you as I please, just as you feel free to judge that man without an opportunity for him to defend himself. I see no crime in his actions. I don't give a damn how long or how many people he looked at, looking at someone is not harassment. And see the way you describe his behavior:

&gt;he hopped seats and was looking for who was alone and an easy target.

You're pre-judging his behavior as malevolent. You don't know that's what he was doing, he may have just as well been looking to have conversation with someone. But again, you assume him nefarious because of his status in life and interpret his actions through that lens. And given this I have to wonder exactly how ""aggressive"" he became. Considering your dishonesty prior and your clear bigotry towards the homeless, I don't entirely trust your word on the matter any longer.

The fact is you, nor anyone else, were in danger or under threat. The fact that the woman did not so much as even give the young man a silent nod of approval tells me she was more concerned about the scene he made than his ""rescue.""

So again I say, you repulse me. Homeless men are misunderstood and reviled by society, they are true victims of man's cruelty and callous disregard. I have heard this story over and over, I have witnessed it myself on more than one occasion. Innocent men who are painted as mustache twirling villains when they are nothing of the sort. I concede this man may not have been completely stable, many homeless suffer mental illness. They deserve your compassion, they are not dragons to be slain by white knights for ladies held hostage. It angers me, and every time I hear another of your ilk regurgitate the same shit, it angers me still. You are not a victim. That woman was not a victim. That young man was not a hero.

The only crime I see is that a man victimized by society has been victimized once more and you are more concerned with hormonal young men being valiant for attractive women than you are with your cruelty of thought. From the moment that man stepped on the bus he was a criminal in your eyes.

"I am not SPD, but I work for a nearby agency.

Call 911 and state that there is a man harassing you and your tenants, you are concerned for your safety, and you would like to have him formally trespassed from the property you manage. He does not need to be on the property for him to be trespassed from it, and there is almost no standard for having someone trespassed, you don't have to wait for a crime to occur. 

As soon as they are available an officer will respond and if he is still there he will be presented with a document that explains that he can not set foot on your property for 1 year and if he does he will be arrested for Criminal Trespass.

This does not prevent him from watching your building from across the street, but it is better than nothing.

Other posters have suggested some form of a protection order. It is unlikely that one would be granted. Protection Orders (of which there are several types) are put in place to protect individuals. You, or one of your tenants, would need to be able to present compelling reason to a judge that this guy is a threat and/or legitimate nuisance to you, as an individual. While I'm not a judge, bases solely on your original post, there is not enough justification for one, yet. 

Please do not lie when you call 911 and provide false/exaggeratory details. You may prevent someone who needs the police more than you from getting the help they need. I know its frustrating that it takes the police a long time to show up, but that is not a SPD problem, it is a nation-wide problem, and it happens everywhere.

"I'm not taking any position on the behavior of the woman in the video, just correcting an improperly stated legal standard regarding harassment. 

And yes, pretty much impossible to prosecute.

Though, since you've brought it up (and I'm a sucker for these kinds of debates)

- Disorderly Conduct (9A.84.030) only has anything to do with location if it's involving a funeral or public meeting. Otherwise, the fact that it's on public property opens up a greater 1st Amendment challenge to any prosecution rather than reinforcing the idea that it's ""disorderly."" (Individuals generally enjoy greater 1st Amendment protections ""in the public sqaure."") Further, as it is directed at a *security guard* and not a civilian, one can make the argument that it is in fact *less* likely to create a risk of assault as a security guard is a professional trained in crowd control and deescalation (or the City has to admit they aren't!). Moreover, one could argue that [State v. E.J.J.](https://www.courts.wa.gov/opinions/pdf/886946.pdf), while not exactly on-point, is sufficiently analogous that, combined with the 1st Amendment issue, gives you a really powerful position on a [Knapstad](http://courts.mrsc.org/appellate/041wnapp/041wnapp0781.htm) motion, or get creative and request a jury instruction on-point.

- Criminal Trespass requires the person be ordered to leave, no subject to an ultimatum (""control yourself *OR* leave"" isn't the same as ""leave"") so by your characterization of the events, I would take the matter to trial, as your interpretation of events fails to meet the ""to convict"" instruction.",,,,GGVH19C,Pioneer Square,,1471716102,t5_2qhad,t3_4yp5kg,t1_d6pjm5k,16,1473509563,0,0,d6pm2e1,Seattle,16,,flair

"&gt; conventionally attractive man

You think this is what it's all about, don't you? I get approached often from men of all levels of attractiveness and being creepy is creepy no matter what. The thing about attractive people is that their appearance is generally together because they have social skills and their life together enough to understand social cues, personal space, and so on. ""Hey, I'm __, I'd love to take you out sometime"" is a completely different interaction from ""Hey you look damn fine where you goin?"" Sometimes you get them from opposite appearances than what you expect, but that's rare. You already know from OP's backstory that the guy was acting bizarre. Not to mention, the guy in the incident chose the woman solely based on her appearance, which fulfills your definition of scum. When I'm dressed up and taking public transit, I'm not looking for attention from anyone. I'm looking nice to fit in the atmosphere of where I'm going. Girls don't just gawk over attractive guys who talk to us and we don't dress up for it. ",,,,lexarexasaurus,,,1470616141,t5_2qhad,t3_4wj7ar,t1_d6868rf,11,1473279105,0,0,d68f967,Seattle,11,,

"A lot of factors. One if the biggest, if not the biggest, is Heroin. Whether or not you believe Heroin should be legal, it ruins lives. Heroin addicts cannot work a 9-5 job, and generally resort to theft to pay for their addiction.

Combine that with Seattle and King County decriminalizing/undercriminalizing property crime and you have a melting pot for disaster. For example, RCW lists three degrees of theft, Theft 1 through 3. 3rd degree is a misdemeanor and is for any theft of property under $750 in value (with some exceptions, like cars worth less than that are still felonies). 2nd degree is $751-5000, and theft 1 is above $5k. However, the King County Prosecutors Office, who handles all felony crime in King County, refuses to file Theft-2 charges unless the theft is more than $1500. Part of this is underfunding, part of this is building in buffer room to guarantee convictions and get plea deals. Once the person is convicted, KCPO generally refused to adhere to state minimum sentences. I know of individuals with multiple theft-2 convictions who have never spent more than 10 days in jail.

It's not a retirement &amp; industry area trying to become a family area (looking at you Ballard), it's not a island of poor commuting connections (looking at you West Seattle &amp; Magnolia).

An Up Zoned Uptown is actually a benefit to Upper Queen Anne..! It's what the city, downtown, and the fringe areas need–we can't spread the density to the edges and expect to keep a vibrant city.

Total: 650K/day. (18% of population) Not far off(proportionally), considering we don't have but 18 miles of light rail (1 line) and 2 commuter rail lines (and 3 streetcars)  Chicago has 110 miles of metros on 8 lines, 11 commuter rail lines running 14 services on 500some miles of tracks, and a solid gridded bus network that's easy to get downtown and easy to get around on and runs pretty damn often.

"Fair warning that what follows is strictly anecdotal personal experience: I almost drowned in a crowded wave pool. I have adequate swimming abilities. I fell off my tube about 2 feet away from the rope (at the wave pool I was in a person was not to pass the rope).

I tried to signal to others around me and the lifeguard (anyone who would for the love of god take notice) that I couldn't catch my breath between waves. It was SO crowded that not one person seemed to notice. I somehow struggled far enough away that I could catch my breath and deal with the waves. It was a near-death experience and no one, with all the activity going on around me, could tell I was struggling.

"I had a strange experience at the Green Lake swimming area a few years ago that made me wonder about life guards in general. A friend and I, on a really hot summer day, were tossing a frisbee in the roped off swimming area (the one near evans pool) and after she threw it over my head I had to swim out to the area near where the folks were jumping off the diving boards.

As chance would have it, about the time I'm out there, this young teenage kid that has just jumped off the higher board comes struggling to the surface yelling for help, obviously unable to swim or tread water enough to catch his breath.

Without really thinking much, and because he was only about 6 feet away from me, I swam to him to help him out. Stupid idea, as he immediately starts to climb up me like a cat up a tree, trying to get his head way above the water, so as I start to go under I push him off me and swim back a few feet, turn my head, and yell LIFEGAURD because they are only ~20 feet away.

But... the one in the tower is busy talking to the one in the rowboat (they are socializing and laughing), who has his back to the swimming area, and they don't hear me and aren't paying attention to the swimming area. I yell again as loud as I fucking can...  * * * LIFEGUARD * * * and this time they look at me... but act like they have no clue why somebody in the swimming area might be yelling LIFEGUARD since I seem fine.

So I yell again GET THE FUCK OUT HERE AND HELP THAT KID while I'm pointing at the kid. 

Then, instead of the guy in the rowboat coming over (I think it would have been 2 row strokes for him), the guard in the tower jumps down and puts a paddleboard in the water and paddles out to the guy -- taking a lot longer than it would have for the guy in the rowboat to come out, and lacking any sense of urgency from my perspective. They haul him to shore and finally realize the dude nearly drowned. They sit him down and the kid looks freaked the fuck out, and just stares at me like he didn't know what to say.

I concluded that day that lifeguards are pretty hit and miss in their level of competence. ",,,,GreyVine,,,1471987507,t5_2qhad,t3_4z7gi1,t1_d6tn1n0,65,1473564698,0,0,d6tt955,Seattle,65,,

We rented it at what was honestly a below-market rate, but when I came it time to renew, the owners saw the how we were maintaining it, and all the small (and not-so small) repairs I had undertaken and honestly didn't mind doing (I'm handy and have to live with it everyday, so why not fix/restore), and decided to forgo any rent increase.   They felt there was a lot of value in having quality renters, and when it eventually came time to move (because they were going to remodel it and downsize into it, or we would have stayed - but I can't blame them for wanting what they did) they gave us a 9-month window to find a new place and no penalty/move out fees/etc",,,,SpacemanLost,,,1470793278,t5_2qhad,t3_4wxo1w,t1_d6ax7sd,18,1473317364,0,0,d6b8wrm,Seattle,18,,
"I'm sure everyone would be super happy if I took my car down the road, going the wrong direction as long as I was going slow.  Wtf happened to laws?  People can do the same ride going down the right side of the street and staying off of the sidewalks.  


You know what is safer?  Have a few of the bikers go ahead, block OFF the road at intersections and then every rider goes through.  I get that everyone wants to stay together...I do get it.  But there are FAR safer ways to do that.  I've seen rides in other cities where blocking the intersection is normal...I have NEVER seen a ride where people go the wrong freakin way down a street or on the sidewalk.


I get YOU didn't personally ride this time.  I'm just venting.  The road AND the sidewalks were full of cars (following the law) and bikers.  There were so many hazards, so many laws broken, and god forbid an emergency vehicle was going in the direction I was.  There would have been no way to get through.


Seriously, block the intersections.  Act like a motorcade is coming through.  Bikers can do that and stay off of the sidewalks.  I do NOT understand how what happened today was allowed to happen.  I've never met a biker with such disregard of the vehicles and PEOPLE around them before.  

Again, not directly at you.  I just sat in traffic, with bikers on BOTH sides of me AND on the sidewalk.  I do NOT get it.  


edit - And, some of the traffic in front of us actually tried to move INTO our lane to block the road.  The bikers were NOT going slow.  That was NOT the case.  Seriously, had someone not realized a car was in the middle of two lanes...where a biker shouldn't be but was driving...they would have plowed right into that car.  It was not only dangerous for those they were around...but it was also for them.  I don't know if you know ANYONE who would listen next time, even if there is any hope for change....but the motorcade approach works.  Send 8 people ahead, block every part of the intersection.  The bikers keep going through on their side of the road and it is SO much safer for everyone. ",,,,fatedperegrine,,,1472349531,t5_2qhad,t3_4zwkfm,t1_d6zgoyj,14,1473640101,0,0,d6zhru2,Seattle,14,,

I'd love to see a GTA take on the denizens of Portland. Also, having an international border could allow for interesting gameplay mechanics, like drug or human smuggling missions. If you have a wanted level, crossing the border unnoticed might decrease your wanted level, but if you were noticed it'd hugely increase it.

"Yeah, you went to an overpriced dinner with terrible service and then wanted them to seat you guys for an additional half hour and supply plates/utensils for your cake for free vs buying overpriced desserts from them ?  The proper way to do that is to speak with the host(ess) about a flat fee and let the restaurant serve the cake you bring (which probably would be the usual service that $5 per plate fee brings).  Just pulling out a cake at the end of your meal is a bit of a gut punch as there's a lot of profit in desserts.

If you have a lot of time you can bus to good places to camp, especially if you have a bike. You can take the bus to North Bend and bike 16 (very beautiful) miles to the end of the Snoqualmie Middle Fork Road. You can go far from there. You can take the bus up to Gold Bar and bike up 2. You can take the bus to Arlington and get to the Mtn Highway Loop (I haven't actually done this one yet). You can also circumnavigate the Olympic Peninsula by bus (it takes 2 days, none of which can be a Sunday). You can get to the Quinault Lodge by bus and take a nearly pancake flat, extremely beautiful bike ride to the Graves Creek trailhead, and the bus will drop you off at the cutoff for the Hoh Rainforest (haven't gotten to the Hoh by bus yet) and you can also get all the way out to the coast by bus, but getting to Forks and biking the 10 miles to La Push or Mora is pretty awesome in itself. There's also a bus stop at the Barnes Creek Trailhead on the north side of the park. 

Closer in, you can access Cougar Mountain from right by the Issaquah transit center, and you can access Tiger Mountain from the 554's stop in downtown Issaquah (either from the High School Trail or if you walk down the road the bus drops you off at you get to another entrance to the park). You can easily bike to Squak mountain. The main ascent up Tiger mountain is accessible from the 208, which takes you to North Bend also. Additionally, you can bike up the Iron Horse via the Snoqualmie Valley Trail trail from where the bus lets you off in North Bend. This will give you access to all the trails off I-90 if you're not already too worn out from getting there.

"For several years I dated a guy who lived on his boat.  That arrangement suited me perfectly--I could visit, and go out on the boat with him, and go home to my full-sized kitchen and my nice big closets and my bathroom that wasn't waaay up the dock.  But for him, it was perfect--living aboard suited him very, very well.

I'd always imagined people who owned boats of this size (most of the ones in his marina were between 30 and 50 feet) to be fairly affluent, but this video is right:  living aboard can be a very economical way to live.  My friend's marina was anything but posh--it was kind of like a trailer park with water.  I would say that at least 2/3 of the live-aboards there were divorced, middle-aged (or older) men of fairly modest means.  Most of them had a similar story--either they kept the boat and their wife got the house when they split, or else they'd always wanted a boat but their wife didn't, and now she wasn't there anymore to say no.  They were mostly nice enough guys, some a little scruffy, but they were friendly and really good about helping each other out.  They had a nice little community going there.

It DOES get cold and damp on a boat in the winter.  There are several varieties of heaters you can get for a boat that work more or less well, but they all have their quirks and drawbacks. When my friend's diesel heater worked, it made the boat nice and dry and toasty-warm--but it frequently didn't work, or didn't work well, and then he would have to tear it apart to fix it, and that would lead to a big mess, and much cursing.  On the other hand...laying in the bunk at night, with the boat gently rocking, listening to the rain on the deck right over your head, and the waves lapping at the sides...that was absolutely lovely.

Another drawback with anything but a pretty large boat is the small galley.  My friend's first boat had an ice box--as in, one that didn't cool on its own, but required him to haul in big blocks of ice every few days to keep any perishables in it.  His stove was small, there was almost no cabinet space, and even less counter space for food prep.  If you don't do much cooking beyond the very basic, that might not be a problem for you, but it would have been a deal-breaker for me.

Another thing that a lot of people don't expect:  sure, the boat has a toilet, and maybe a shower, but you may decide not to make full use of them.  At the risk of TMI, a lot of boat owners use the head for peeing, but they will go up the dock and use the shore head to take a dump, and request that visitors do the same.  A holding tank full of urine smells a little, but one with the full range of human wastes stinks *BAD*.  And let me tell you:  if you wake up in the middle of a cold, rainy night feeling sick and crampy, or just with an urgent need to shit, and you have to hike all the way up that goddamn dock (wet and slick, or maybe icy) to the head, you WILL take that opportunity to re-think the wisdom this living aboard stuff.  Also, the onboard shower is going to be very, very small, and you won't have much hot water, and using it only increases the dampness on board.  My friend had installed shelves in his shower, and he used the one the marina provided up on shore.

I'll admit it:  I am WAY too fond of all my stuff (kitchen tools and appliances and gadgets, clothes, books, art, etc.) to give them up or put them in storage--and those alone would have filled the entire living space on my friend's boat.  But if you're already inclined to travel light, and you don't do a lot of elaborate cooking, and you can tolerate some mild to moderate daily inconveniences if the trade-offs include an affordable place to live, plus, hey, you'll own a BOAT...you might be a candidate for living aboard.",,,,casagordita,SeaTac,,1471326466,t5_2qhad,t3_4xwhge,t3_4xwhge,49,1473428955,0,0,d6jd8g4,Seattle,49,,flair

"I've been in Seattle for 10 years now. I'm not considering leaving at all. I love it here. I know that's not what you're looking for in this post, but figured I'd provide my alternate viewpoint.

Can I ask what it is you consider the ""not so good""? Genuinely curious, as I have my own list but know it varies from person to person.

For me, there's so many things I love about this city that I can't imagine settling anywhere else. First off, the amazing nature we have within close range. We're within a couple hours of multiple national parks plus the sound and multiple lakes/rivers if you like outdoor activities. Seahawks/Sounders/Mariners if you're into sports. Amazing restaurant/food scene (I know some will disagree with this or say other towns are better, but I love it here).

I also love how every neighborhood in Seattle feels like its own little city. I've visited some towns with the same vibe, but not quite like here. We are also within range of a lot of great day/weekend trips. Vancouver, Portland, Orcas, Bainbridge, Walla Walla, Woodinville, Oregon Coast, etc.

I've done so much in the 10 years I've been here, but feel like I have so much left to do. Plus, I view our city's growth as an opportunity for even more. It will bring more culture, events, restaurants, bars and other entertainment our way. Again, some may not view this as a positive.

"&gt; We're already subsidizing the conservative parts of the state with our taxes if you live in King county, why don't we cut them off for a little while and fix our shit?

This is literally the 3rd rail of Olympia politics. I was at some community meeting once and one of the state reps from... I want to see it was whatever district is like Wallingford was there. Standard group of people around him, pinging him with questions, and I threw out something like that.

&gt; ""The rural parts of the state always hold our transportation package desires as hostages with guns to our head to get what they want. Why don't we do the same exact thing to them with the threat of a law to stop each county exporting taxes? Whatever revenue is raised in a county, 90% stays there. Only 10% can be exported.""

I asked something like that, give or take. He just laughs and specifically says that would lead to an all-out political shooting war that no one in Western Washington has the nerve or will to fight. It would completely cripple the state, and many rural areas would be quickly bankrupted by such a law. No more schools, no more funding. I asked, ""what if you allowed that cash to be exported outside for schools and critical things like water and irrigation?""

I got blown off pretty good with a bunch of bullshit.

"Most would argue that space for a car is not a minimum requirement to have enough space to live. It does make a lot of sense if you live in the suburbs since often the alternatives are never developed but by living in the city you have access to a much more developed transit network, most likely closer retail, and the ability to walk and bike short to medium distances. In the last couple years car share programs such as ReachNow and Car2Go also often allow any gaps to be mitigated. The age of ridesharing also means that getting a taxi like service is easier and cheaper than ever. Switching to a non-car commute doesnt even mean you are getting rid of your car, it just means you have it when you really need it and then deal with parking but most days it stays put. I have my car for going mountain biking and to races but otherwise I do a combo of bike/walk/bus to get around 4 days a week.

You are certainly allowed to want space for your vehicle but there is no requirement on the city to provide that. If guaranteed space for your car is a requirement then that is something you need to plan for, and most likely pay for. If that ups your rent too much then your options are: ditch the car, pay the luxury tax, or you may have to move to a more car friendly neighborhood inside or outside of the city. As much as owning and driving a car feels like a right, it is ultimately still a privilege and the state/city have no obligation to accommodate you. 

I know you mentioned cost as an issue elsewhere in the thread. Cars are incredibly expensive to own and operate just by themselves, the IRS puts the estimate around $0.56/mile I beleive: that adds up really fast. Beyond that by taking away street right of way for parking they diminish the effectiveness of bus and bike transit which impacts alternative commuters as well as makes it harder for people trying to save money by going car free. Requiring parking off street takes away from living and business square footage increasing rents: again making things more expensive. I mean the space that a parking spot plus the access path (think a parking garage) could easily fit a loft apartment or small coffee shop. The reality is cars, in a city environment at least, are a luxury not a requirement. If you must own a vehicle, and a place to park it, then you will have to decide how much that is worth to you and if realize that you have to pay an extra cost for it and it may force you to live somewhere cheaper to make up for it.",,,,xarune,Fremont,,1471273730,t5_2qhad,t3_4xse4p,t1_d6i1w9e,16,1473415920,0,0,d6id1if,Seattle,16,,flair

"Inventory would have to skyrocket for that to happen.  3,554 active listings right now in King County.  At the peak of the housing bubble there was almost 4x as many active listings.

The inventory shortage is a very real thing right now.  Inventory has been getting better (not setting record lows like it was back in February of this year at ~2,000 active listings), but it is still way lower than usual.  

Graphs available at: http://seattlebubble.com/blog/2016/08/05/nwmls-listings-inch-sales-dip-prices-slip/

A housing bubble is definitely possible, but I feel like it would have to be more related to a big external force (interest rates rising, global recession) or local companies faltering (Amazon, Microsoft, etc.).  Based on recent quarterly earnings, local large corporations (outside of a little dip for Boeing) are doing well.

Amazon right now is building enough office space in South Lake Union to fit ~70,000 employees.  Where are they all going to live?  What's going to happen when some of those employees decide they want to leave apartments and live in Single Family Houses?",,,,MegaRAID01,Hillman City,,1470673963,t5_2qhad,t3_4wqtpt,t3_4wqtpt,16,1473289788,0,0,d696a30,Seattle,16,,flair

"Sounds like a job for some Livestock Guardian Dogs. 

&gt;While LGDs have been known to fight to the death with predators, in most cases predator attacks are prevented by a display of aggressiveness. LGDs are known to drive off predators that physically they would be no match for, such as bears and even lions. With the reintroduction of predators into natural habitats in Europe and North America, environmentalists have come to appreciate LGDs because they allow sheep and cattle farming to coexist with predators in the same or nearby habitats. Unlike trapping and poisoning, LGDs seldom kill predators; instead, their aggressive behaviors tend to condition predators to seek unguarded (thus, non-farm animal) prey. For instance, in Italy's Gran Sasso National Park, where LGDs and wolves have coexisted for centuries, older, more experienced wolves seem to ""know"" the LGDs and leave their flocks alone.

TLDR: Aging landlord sells small apartment building. ""Tenant"" Bill, who has failed to pay rent for years, is disabled and  can't afford to move, kills himself.

OP insinuates that the new building owners should be held accountable for....  Bill's death?

OP, when you grow up and move out of your parent's place, you have to learn to take care of yourself. When you rent, you gain freedom from repairs and property taxes, but you give up a certain stability. Rents go up, landlords change, and so is life. 

It's sad Bill killed himself. It's tragic he felt he didn't have other options. But, you're OD'ing on crazy pills if you want property owners held accountable for their tenant's behavior.

"wow, minus 56 points and dropping. I struck a nerve for sure, something i'm unlikely to have done if I were truly wrong. 

an analogy:

imagine you go to, let's say, Best Buy. Imagine you know every last thing there is to know about retail, computer, and audio equipment. Because of the poorly thought out make up of employees in the store, they profit from both their customers and their employees not knowing what they're doing. If an employee knows what he's doing, he tells customers how to build a speaker themselves, saving lots of money, or tells the customer exactly how  to build their own computer, again saving money and definitely not causing a sale for Best Buy.

If a customer has aforementioned knowledge, he doesn't go in there in the first place, for obvious reasons.

Now you have two customers come in: a crazy cat lady, and someone who knows everything and wants to help his fellow man. The crazy cat lady might make a stink and start to throw things. Crazy cat lady might scream about a coupon she misunderstood. Crazy cat lady might try to return something because she didn't know how to use it. The point is, she is incompetent, and Best Buy can only profit from people like her, so they let most of her behavior slide. 

Person who knows everything comes in, and tries to inform fellow customers of how they can save money by carving their own parts out of wood, or purchasing parts online. Person who knows everything is doing nothing wrong, has only best interests at heart, but is far more likely to be removed from Best Buy by security, despite having done nothing technically wrong. Their contingencies didn't plan for competence. 

And now we come full circle to your question. How are Seattlites when confronted with a Transgender person? Well, sadly, living here for quite a while, and even deeply loving many of its residents, Seattle is the Best Buy of America. It has a smart, cool looking veneer, it portrays itself as a smart place, as would Best Buy, but if you dig under the surface, it is threatened by competence. 

Seattle wants nothing more but to congratulate itself that it loves everyone, and that it opens its arms to people of all nations, sexual orientations, races, etc; but hasn't done the hard work necessary to actually embrace things that are different. They want to have a ""buddy"" with downs syndrome, but they aren't going to marry him, so to speak.

So if you arrive with a well rounded, competent, challenging view of how Seattle can accommodate a Transgendered person, they are going to pretend to love you until you scare them, and you'll find a lot of love on the surface, with a notorious lack of depth. the ""Seattle Freeze"" didn't get coined for no reason. 

If you arrive kinda dopey and lovable and keep your head down, and never ask your Seattle peers the tough questions about how they can accommodate you, you'll find them very happy in your presence, and you may just be happier for never knowing why that is.

But hell, minus 56 votes, I must be wrong. I must be dead wrong, so I encourage you to come here, and really let the rubber hit the road as it pertains to Seattle's ability to reason and think on its feet about issues it doesn't fully comprehend. Or maybe it does comprehend it fine, and I'm the one who is incorrect, it wouldn't be the first time. 

I guess the litmus test is: arrive and be different, see how they love, arrive and challenge, see where they go. ",,,,asthingsgo,,,1471804111,t5_2qhad,t3_4ytt0s,t1_d6qf0r5,-14,1473525320,0,0,d6qufav,Seattle,-14,,

"Yeah. Don't ride through Seattle. Bicyclists are in fact much worse for the environment than good for the environment when pertaining to their slow down, stopping of traffic and the energy needed to regain speed from all the slow downs and stops. This isn't debatable as it is scientifically proven that gas mileage in the city is much worse than your gas mileage on the freeway.

The more stops, pauses and slow downs caused by bicycles are becoming the major reason why more gasoline/fuel is being used for but a few people. 

Not to mention the amount of people's time they waste and unnecessary stress they cause to drivers when on the road. Don't get me started on their superiority complex. 

TL; DR: cyclists are worse for the environment, dangerous to drivers, reduce economic productivity and are toxic to Seattles delicate transportation system.

"...what? That's hardly harassment. Looking at someone isn't harassment, speaking to someone isn't harassment, and touching someone is dubious. If he just gently held her arm I wouldn't call that harassment at all.

If I had to guess, the woman didn't acknowledge the young man because she never felt under threat and did not want his ""help"". And as far as I can tell, the only reason you felt that man should not be engaging with that woman is because he was, in your words, a ""dirty and smelly homeless man."" You have no idea who that man was, what he's like, you haven't even a clue what he said to that woman. But you judge him none the less in one of the worst ways.

"While addressing verifiable acts of discrimination is important, the Seattle Office of Civil Rights is far from a [neutral actor](http://www.thenewamerican.com/culture/item/23801-seattle-taxpayers-to-fund-series-of-racial-equality-workshops).  If you go to the SOCR website, it appears to be more of an advocacy/resource department, akin to a Diversity or LGBT center at a college campus, which is beyond a reasonable doubt *not* considered a ""neutral"" institution; often the more *racism* they find, the more *funding* they get.  In the investigation you cited for example, only 13 out of 124 developments investigated were found to be in violation by SOCR investigators, and yet *all* 13 complaints were settled; no lawsuits were even filed.  The SOCR doesn't even have a legal team, and it would have to go through other public offices like HUD to complete a lawsuit.  However, HUD has a rigorous process for determining the viability of a case, and none of these instances would pass muster.  The $19k in settlements from 13 establishments is nothing, even for a settlement, meaning SOCR was essentially just paid to stop wasting employee time with unwinnable cases.

Actual research organizations such as universities tend to perform these studies more reliably because they're usually interested in understanding the *why* of the outcome, not in the outcome itself.  I just don't believe that a public office whose existence hinges on finding discrimination wherever it can is reasonably qualified to examine the extent and severity of discrimination.

"&gt;Homelessness has reached a state of emergency in Seattle due to a housing affordability crunch, driven in part by the tech boom. Amazon’s corporate headquarters are in Seattle and the company is aggressively hiring large numbers of high-paid tech workers. 

Without coming out and saying, this is basically pinning the homeless crisis in some part on Amazon's presence here.


We had a lower-middle-class space in town, it was SLU, and Amazon blew that to shit when it relocated down there and ignited the megaboom we've had since.  If not for Amazon, growth would have happened anyway, but at a pace that would have let more people gradually adjust to upzoning and upscaled dwelling conversion.  We lost hundreds of low income apartment buildings in a short timeframe in the resulting boom.  I have to think some of those people wound up being homeless, given that ""the $500 sleeping room"" was the kind of space that got removed from SLU since 2010, and has not been replaced.

We had normal paced growth before Amazon.  We had tech companies before Amazon.  We had plenty of employment before Amazon.  But once Amazon expanded into SLU, the game completely changed.  Cities have to balance and be for all levels of income, not just the very top.  Amazon's move to SLU ignited our conversion from a ""all levels of affordability"" to a ""only 1% income need bother.""

I applaud Amazon for going through the motions of caring about the people their rapid expansion pushed out.  I'm sure a lot of you Amazon employees will feel proud to be part of such a caring gesture, as well.

And before you supply-siders say we need thousands of shiny towers up to 100 floors all over SLU to compensate, none of those new buildings would be renting out $500 sleeping rooms either.

There's another kit in the school nurse's office in case he's unconscious or forgets the one he's supposed to carry.

"&gt;This is not an excessive project. 

Yes, it is.

&gt;Good architecture built to last both aesthetically and functionally is worth the cost.

It's worth *a* cost.  Not *this* cost, not to me (and clearly a number of other people in Seattle).  If they could build this thing for $10 million, I'd say absolutely, it's worth the cost.  At the current price they're quoting, I do not believe it to be worth it.  We can scale back some of the fancy parts and still make it nice looking.  The ""big gray box"" comment was rhetorical; certainly we don't want ugly, monolithic Soviet bloc style buildings, but we should also be careful with taxpayer funds.  You can build a nice building for a lot less.  They built the brand new, 91k square foot [Genesee Hill School](http://bex.seattleschools.org/bex-iv/genesee-hill-site/) for $40m.  4x that for a slightly bigger building and a parking garage seems excessive.

I support gun rights, but the direct correlation of gun control and gang violence in Chicago does not in any way imply the causation of it.

"I go to Seattle U and am out late at night in Capitol Hill for most of the time.

Here's a crappy layout of where you want to go and avoid:
http://i.imgur.com/BP5JRCP.jpg


*Stay in the green area to be safe. Be weary that there have been gun violence near the iHOP and the QFC that are located in the green area, but it's gang violence. If you just want to walk around at night, take a stroll through Capitol Hill downtown or go through Seattle U where we have excessive public safety that patrol the grounds 24/7.*

**AVOID EAST JEFFERSON STREET AMD EVERYTHING SOUTH OF IT PAST 5pm (including international district)** there's a lot of crazies (homeless drug addicts) and it's pretty scary at night (I've been out there at 3am).

**Avoid anything north past 14-15th street. That's where you enter gang areas, especially after you past the hospital on the hill (the Swedish one on 16th, not the main Swedish hospital)**

Be weary of your surroundings in the orange zones but you should be fine if you're with others. 

Just stay in Capitol Hill downtown where there's a lot of people and you'll be super safe. You really just want to avoid walking down places alone or that are in the red zones, regardless if you're with your significant other or whatnot.

"You can send a message to Jay Inslee, either by phone at 360-902-4111 or via [e-message](https://fortress.wa.gov/es/governor/). This is what I wrote to him just now:

&gt; Governor Inslee,

&gt; I wanted to write to you to express my outrage over the recent actions of the Department of Fish and Wildlife with respect to the Profanity Peak wolfpack. As you may have heard by now, the department's Wildlife Commission sanctioned the extermination of the entire wolfpack as a result of one rancher's loss of a few heads of cattle in Ferry County. It has further been reported that this rancher, Len McIrvin of Diamond M Ranch, deliberately set his cattle, unmonitored, in the wolfpack's immediate hunting area. Mr. McIrvin cannot claim ignorance of this fact, given the fact that he has done this very thing before when he caused the extermination of the Wedge wolfpack previously. Mr. McIrvin's actions are inexcusably selfish and an exploitation of the lenience given to him and his industry by the state and federal officials. I would go so far as to call them animal abuse, not only for causing systemic extermination of the wolves, but for deliberately putting his cattle in harm's way. It is even more distressing to know that the Department of Fish and Wildlife does nothing to curtail his behavior and appears more sympathetic to him than to the wildlife they are supposed to protect.

&gt; I urge you to work with the Department of Fish and Wildlife to reevaluate their protocols in these types of situations and to hold this rancher and others like him accountable for these actions. As I wrote in an e-mail to the Wildlife Commission itself, I am concerned that it is protecting interests of the cattle ranching industry over the interests of wildlife, and I find this deplorable. I hope that you will address this concern, which I am sure many of your other constituents share, in a timely manner so that unnecessary killing of our state's wildlife can be prevented in the future.",,,,zangelbertbingledack,North Beacon Hill,,1472233015,t5_2qhad,t3_4zmw6g,t3_4zmw6g,25,1473615842,0,0,d6xrny9,Seattle,25,,flair

"There are a lot of ways to accomplish it, but it usually starts with the banks.

Try applying for a loan to open a whole foods chain in Bellevue vs the Central district. Your odds of the Bellevue location being approved are much better than Central district.

Why?

There are a lot of very rational, not-necessarily-racist reasons. It's not the target demographic for whole foods, the average income of the neighborhood probably means profits will be slow. Crime is higher in that neighborhood, and there aren't many similar businesses in proximity.

Now, banks don't like to mention that they are the biggest cause of these reasons they cite. They labeled the neighborhood a risky investment decades ago, and over time have contributed to their initial assessment staying true. Home loans, business loans, all the types of credit that a neighborhood leverages to grow and prosper dry up the moment your address falls inside the bank's red lines.

Before long good job opportunities start to dry up because people from poor neighborhoods are seen as a risky hire.

A couple generations of this, and you've created a poor neighborhood nobody can seem to leave, built on lines drawn by racial segregation and covered up with a facade of economic excuses.

"That poster is hilarious. My reaction as someone who lives on the other side of Aurora:

&gt; The mayor has a 20-year growth plan for Seattle which includes rezoning to uptown neighborhood (Lower Queen Anne) to allow building heights of up to 160 feet (16 stories)?

I knew there was a plan, but I didn't know the details. That sounds pretty cool.

Okay? There is always building going on. I just hope they follow the new rules about preserving sidewalk access.

Lemme get out my magnifying class so I can take 10 minutes to type in that URL into my phone. I'm also uncertain about what traffic issues they are talking about; Queen Anne is usually fine until you get to Mercer.

"I've had to call 911 three times in the past 9 months or so. In each case SPD responded very quickly and did, I felt, a very good and professional job. The first was for a street fight that got gnarly outside of my house (one guy got clocked, knocked out cold and hit the ground hard). The second and third times were regarding a guy with clearly stolen property going through my alley. 

With the street fight, they were on scene while I was still on the phone with 911, very fast. With the property crimes they arrived slower, albeit within 10 minutes or so. The main thing is that in each case I was reporting either a crime in progress or one that had just occurred and was able to provide descriptions of the suspect(s) as well as their location. Without that information the cops don't really have much to work with and other more immediate situations take priority. 

It annoys me when people complain that it took SPD hours to respond to their report of crime that happened a while ago by an unknown person (ie stolen car, break in that happened while you were away, etc). Of course it did. In a perfect world they'd be there in a heart beat. But the reality of the situation is that we have very limited police resources and unless the crime just happened and you can provide a description and location of the suspect, getting the cops there sooner won't really help anything and only takes resources away from more serious emergencies.

"Would you be receptive to my advice if I actually gave it? I've touched on it elsewhere in this thread, but I welcome the opportunity to spell it out more clearly. 

1. Change your mindset. Be aware of what is going on around you, project an assertive attitude, and be prepared for possible scenarios that you think might occur. Don't just think, ""what could that person do to me?"" But also, ""If they do that, how will I respond?"" Because aggressors sure as shit won't try to make things fair for you.
2. Take a self defense class. The more you know about how to actually handle yourself in an altercation, the more you will be able to execute on item 1. 
3. After item 2, revisit your mindset. I'm putting this as number 3, but it really should be something you continually observe and revise. Think about what *you* can do to make yourself safe. For example, walking down an alley, alone, late at night? That might be a bad call. I don't do that even though I'm an adult male and I tend to be armed. Would it be great if people wouldn't rob or kill you? The law says they aren't allowed to, but reality sure as shit suggests otherwise. And you know what, the law says I would be fully justified in shooting them if they tried to rob me. But I have thought about it, and through understanding my mindset I have made the decision that I don't need to put myself in that situation in the first place. 
4. Revisit item 2. Perhaps this iteration includes weapons, mace, or other more advanced techniques. 

All of this is really about responsibility for one's self; where we can talk about self defense, financial responsibility, being a kind and respectful person and supportive lover, and a level of self-awareness that most people in this world just don't have, where I could go deeper and suggest things like meditation, yoga, and goal planning.

All in all, be a kind person but don't expect the world to be kind back, and be prepared to handle yourself because it's a dick move to expect other to take care of you if you won't take action to take care of yourself.

"TL;DR - It's generally just the long-term locals who are described as ""freezers"" (not transplants). IMO, it is grossly exaggerated &amp; is also a misinterpretation of locals' behavior. If you get here expecting to get ""freezed"" or with a negative opinion of the people who already live here, it can become a self-fulfilling prophesy. If you don't sweat it and get here ready to relax and have a little fun, you probably won't have much trouble.

Background: I've spent my life about evenly split between Seattle &amp; the MW (my mom's fam is from Seattle, my dad's from MN / I consider Seattle my home; my spouse is from WI). 
Both regions do have a distinct culture &amp; the reality it, not everyone from the MW feels comfortable here - and not everyone here would be comfortable in the MW. The ""Seattle freeze"" seems to be an attempt at explaining what it is that prevents some people from feeling comfortable here, and isn't necessarily the best way to do it.

This is my personal theory on how to explain this cultural discomfort (everything is IMO/IME): 

Being ""polite"" is highly valued in MW, moreso than in the PNW. MW communities tend to be tight knight and somewhat interdependent, which makes ""rocking the boat"" much riskier. This is probably due to MW communities being built on older farming communities and their need to band together to survive the harsh midwestern winters. ""Politeness"" includes a lot of unspoken rules about how to communicate and behave, and you fail to pick up &amp; follow them, you will likely be perceived as ""rude,"" and many people will trust you less. This cultural feature makes sense given the region's history: people who were ""rude"" when group cohesion was necessary to survive winters could be a threat to everyone's survival.

In the PNW, honesty, openness, and directness are highly valued. If you are too ""nice""/""polite,"" many people here will be less trusting of you, because if you're only ever saying ""nice""/""polite"" things, you're obviously not being entirely honest/open/direct (as everyone has ""not nice"" thoughts and notices ""impolite"" things, and we all know it). Again, looking at the history of the region, these cultural features make sense: the region's history includes the yukon goldrush, literal cowboys, and (most relevant to Seattle in particular) logging communities. These early communities would have been comprised of people who were quite independent and mostly male, and built on business. They didn't need each other to the same extent as people in the midwest (especially given our mild winters), but they did need to get shit done. The risk of inefficiency due to withholding information was a greater risk to group survival than the loss of group cohesion due to rudeness. 

So, to put that into practice: IME, sometimes people from the midwest come to Seattle and attempt to make friends by smiling, making polite chit chat, and waiting to be invited places. When that invitation never comes, some of them start looking for explanations, and one of the common ones is that Seattle residents must be cold and unwelcoming (""the Seattle freeze""). 

The opposite example would be people from Seattle coming to visit the midwest, being loud and obnoxious in public, being all ""omg it's SO boring out here how do you survive lol"" and then being confused why people seem offended (but politely refrain from saying ""why would I want to be friends with you when you're inconsiderate and say rude things about my home?"") and don't want to hang out with them.

The thing to do if you want to make friends here, IME, is be proactive. Don't be a total asshole but don't be afraid to say what you want, and be willing to ask for phone numbers or be the one to make plans. If you seem comfortable, other people will probably be more comfortable around you. Avoid being judgmental, but don't be too nervous about TMI or potentially rocky subjects. Personally, I've had the most success making friends in environments like classes (and there's lots of free stuff if you look around for it!) and smaller events. These situations create something less personal to talk about, and if those conversations go well, it's easy to dovetail into ""so why are you interested in this?"" and/or ""want to go to this other similar event with me/my friends?""

"If you've never heard of Bob, here are key snippets from the article:

&gt; I think the thing that I’m probably most proud of is the fact that the International District is still a residential neighborhood with low income elderly. We put a lot of effort in keeping them in place, low income immigrant families. It’s still a neighborhood that accepts the low-income population, whether it’s seniors or families as a residential base, and as you’re preserving this neighborhood for them, you’re also trying to balance, you’re also working with developers who want to bring in market rate housing, and maybe even higher income housing so your neighborhood isn’t just a low-income ghetto for seniors. I mean you have families, you have working people, and you have higher income people, so you have a total mixed community, and you’re not being gentrified from one class eliminating another class, but you have a neighborhood that’s inclusive of all these elements.

"I think accountability is a good thing too. So let's talk about Bill's accountability; to plan for his future, to pay his housing obligations, to research alternative housing options when the compassionate mom and pop landlords he rented from sold the building, to get the mental health treatment he needed. 

Accountability is a two way road and if you don't adjust your worldview soon, you'll forever see yourself, and others, as victims. 

Your title didn't require careful reading, but now I have to ask.  Does WA have lax landlord requirements compared to other states in your opinion?  Your title infers that ""this state"" has room for improvement, but compared to where?


Landlords and tenants enter a business relationship. Maybe you're unaware, but there already exist many laws preventing landlords from acting with ""total disregard"" of their tenants. 

This article is a repost. I read it the first time it was posted, over a year ago, and felt the same way then. 

If YOU'D read the article you posted in full, then YOU'D know this landlord was a mom and pop operation, willing to sacrifice receiving rent due from Bill for an extended period of time. The author hints that they were aging and possibly nearing retirement and selling their investment to fund their retirement.  But fuck Eve and Charles right?  They shouldn't be able to retire and should remain ""accountable"" for Bill's crappy situation. 

Where was he supposed to go?  The harsh reality is that this is Bill's problem. Fortunately, we live in a compassionate city that spends hand over fist to subsidize and provide a plethora of options for those in need. It's too bad Bill chose suicide without exhausting every option. But Bill's behavior is in absofuckinglutely not something even a ""greedy corporation"" should ""be held accountable"" for.

Trade-up homes: $443,000
Upper-tier/luxury homes: $758,000

You can add a bunch of money onto each tier type for the city of Seattle itself and parts of the Eastside. But the good news for those going into the trade-up market is the inventory story: The biggest drop in available homes lately has been in starter homes, or those that are the cheapest. The middle- and upper-tier homes are seeing inventory drops, too, but not as much. 

The big issue facing homebuyers trying to buy a new home now is that they can't find something new so are scared to pull the trigger on actually selling their old home. A lot of people are renting now between home purchases. It can take a year or more in today's competitive market to find something.

It's not like I'm saying don't treat them. I'm saying don't let the perfect be an enemy of the good and remember that saying my way or the highway is what got us here. Housing first works to accomplish the things you want in ways that shoving them on the streets doesn't. As an example look at the housing that allows alcoholics to drink. A 2009 study published by the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) said it saved taxpayers $4 million a year in housing and crisis services that would’ve been incurred had the inebriates been living on the streets. It also reduced their alcohol use by about one-third. A 2012 UW study also found decreased consumption.

We can learn what other places did poorly, and what they did well, and chart a course to making the greatest, and most pleasant city to live in.",,,,alexfrancisburchard,Kent,,1472611626,t5_2qhad,t3_50eqdo,t3_50eqdo,27,1473690509,0,0,d73ijna,Seattle,27,,flair

"Let me explain what is actually happening here.

This ammunition (7N6) is actually not made for AK-47, it is made for AK-74. AK-47 uses 7.62x39 caliber, 7N6 is 5.45x39, and was made to compete with NATO's 5.56x45.

The law in question bans armor-piercing ammunition - the one that contains steel core - for HANDGUNS. The armor piercing ammunition which can be fired in rifles only is perfectly legal, but if it can be used in handguns - and therefore used by criminals against police - it is forbidden for civilians to own.

Up until recently, there were plenty of handguns which use AK action - for example, this: http://www.guns.com/reviews/draco-pistol/. The whole concept of an AK (or AR) pistol was created to circumvent the rule that requires special registration, taxation, and other restrictions on short-barreled rifles - enacted in 1934 because short barreled rifles were popular with organized crime (National Firearms Act of 1934). These guns are not ""designed to be fired from the shoulder"" and are therefore regulated as pistols, not rifles.

This is the reason 7.62x39 with the steel core was prohibited for import a long time ago (and, obviously, is not made here). But 5.45x39 was fine, because there was no pistols chambered in this caliber.

Then, one day, some someone started importing Polish 5.45x39 pistol. Which prompted ATF to reclassify the ammunition (text of their regulation is here: https://www.atf.gov/news/pr/test-examination-and-classification-7n6-545x39-ammunition).

Unfortunately, up to this day 5.45x39 was extremely inexpensive - due to it being imported from Russia - and thus rifles shooting it were extremely popular. Then, overnight, it went from one of the most available calibers to one of the rarest, because the imports ceased, and there were little production facilities here (or even in Russia - for lead core alternative) - because the military imports were so cheap.

Of course, how many people are killed by these evil, military looking guns? Zero a year. These ""handguns"" are still huge and almost impossible to conceal, on top of being relatively rare and expensive.

"&gt;You forgot the rest

The rest of your sentence doesn't change the meaning of what a species is, and therefore what killing a species means.

&gt;Where did I say anything about killing off a whole species or the entire species

""Killing a species"" implies extinction.  Otherwise you aren't killing the *species*, but rather *members of* of the species.  When you have to go get your pet dog put down, have you ever heard anyone refer to that as killing the Canis lupus familiaris (sub)species?  I'll bet not, and I think you'd look at them funny if they did.  You might think it's pedantic, but using precise language is important to avoid implying things you don't mean, like you did here.  That said, understanding the difference between terms that describe the members of a group, versus the group as a whole, and using the correct one doesn't seem like pedantry to me.  Seems like a basic tenet of clear communication.

Moving on, your comparison of 11 wolves of the *Washington* population to the population of the world is poor.  You can't take the proportion of a narrowly defined population (Gray Wolves in Washington) and then apply it to a broadly defined population (Humans on Earth).  If you want to make the comparison, you need to change your human culling figure to one of these three numbers:

* WA: (11 / 90) * [7,062,000](https://www.google.com/search?q=population+of+washington+state) or 862,976 
* USA: (11 / [16,705](https://www.fws.gov/midwest/wolf/aboutwolves/wolfpopus.htm)) * [318,900,000](https://www.google.com/search?q=population+of+usa) or 209,991
* World: (11 / [200,000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_gray_wolf_populations_by_country)) * 7,500,000,000 or 412,500

I know, it doesn't sound as dramatic as ***NINE HUNDRED SIXTEEN MILLION HUMANS!!!***  Maybe I'm just being ""pedantic"" again by scaling back the hyperbole.  The point is, if 862,976 people died tomorrow, we'd be fine as a species.  Hell, we've done it multiple times over the last century alone and yet here we are.

I never said it wasn't a big deal.  My point is that it's not *nearly* as big a deal as you're pretending it is.

Lastly, it bears mentioning that on a global scale, the Gray Wolf is not considered endangered at all.  Just something to think about while you're grabbing your torch and pitchfork.

Burritos are a fairly common takeout food at a similar price point and speed to teriyaki. It seemed like a natural comparison. Seattle's lack of burrito or wrap takeout places is strange. As more people have been moving up north to Seattle, I thought Burrito places would migrate north as well. So far, no luck. The author compared pho to teriyaki. I think that is a stranger comparison because, despite the pricing similarity, pho is typically eaten in restaurant and teriyaki is a takeout meal. 

PS: If anyone is in Fremont, check out Rancho Bravo. So few people know it is there that I am worried they might close. The burrito wrapping job is often not up to par with the capitol hill outlet, but the seasoning and perfectly cooked meat has been spot on so far. 

PPS: Yoshino's spicy chicken on first hill is my favorite fast food under $8. It is traditional fast food, ready when you are.

"How many people attended the class?

* In my class (I went in April, this isn't new) there were probably 20-25 people, not all of whom were white. Many of my co-workers went as well to the class on different days and experienced similar sized groups, and when I got the confirmation email it was noted that all of the classes were full and that they had a waiting list, which indicates to me that there is demand for this.

How much did it cost?

* My employer bought a block of tickets so I don't know what mine was, but looking at the current course page it says $60 (though they are all sold out, again indicating demand)

What is one policy or perception this class changed your mind?

* There were a lot of things that were powerful in the class. Much of it had to do with putting definitions on concepts that are thrown around a lot but not deeply explored. People who are immersed in equity issues might find the class pretty 101 but you could tell that it was broadening the perceptions of a lot of people in the room (myself included), which was a powerful experience in itself. One specific definition that stuck with me was a culminating definition of white privilege as something to the effect of ""to have gone your whole life without having had a deep relationship with a POC and not having felt like anything was lost."" The implication being that white culture is so dominant, and our society so racially and socioeconomically stratified, that you can exist within your own bubble as a white person and feel complete. I'm not sure this changed my mind about anything necessarily, but has led me to re-examine my own life and relationships and try to form more diverse friendships. I'm aware this might sound like tokenism, but i'm already spending too much time on this reply for a Friday afternoon and am not sure I can examine the nuance here right now.

Could you think of better ways of spending the money to help minorities?

* I'm not really sure how to answer this. Can we optimize for every dollar spent on any issue? No. Since the city is just hosting these classes and especially since people are buying tickets (pretty expensive ones too) and thus offsetting most of the cost, this program is a minor percentage of a percentage of the city budget, and even probably (no data to support this) a sliver of the arts and culture budget, I think its worthwhile. In the context of city budget that also provides basic human services, education, health, police, arts programs (some of which include grants for specific cultural heritage events/institutions), and all other sorts of things that ""help minorities"" (and other people too), do I believe it worthwhile to spend a modicum of funding on promoting intercultural understanding and learning (of which these are not the only courses and programs by the way)? Yes I do. Are they the most essential aspects of the city budget? No.

"Throwaway for obvious reasons.

This is going to seem harsh, but please believe me when I tell you it comes from a good place. 

In my honest opinion, no it's not worth it.  I graduated from Cornish about 15 years ago. I ended up with over 100k in student loan debt and a completely worthless degree to show for it. 

The overall education I received there was shoddy. It truly is an arts conservatory, NOT a college! The ""humanities and sciences"" classes are a joke. Aside from your chosen major, you pretty much learn as much as you force yourself to. I graduated without ever having written a proper research paper, or even an essay. 

With no real-world skills or education, I walked out utterly useless for the current job market. My options were pretty much take out more loans and go to grad school, or work as a barista and start paying those student loans down. 15 years later and yep you guessed it-  still working in food service. Still paying those student loans down. Many of my classmates are living back at home and working service jobs well into their 30's.

It's not *just* Cornish though- it's art school in general. I'm embarrassed to tell people I went to art school, people laugh at me whenever they find out. ""Wtf were you thinking??"" is the most common reaction, followed by shrieks of hysterical laughter. 

My best advise: skip film school. Make your own work. Read everything you can, go to art galleries, meet other artists and find projects to collaborate on, watch all the great films and documentaries you can. Watch the bad ones too! Find your voice and develop your own interests and style. Also read True and False by David Mamet. 

Save yourself while you still can!!!

"Storytime. 

About 7 or so years ago, when I first moved to Seattle, I moved into a small studio with my friend from Highschool as a temp place until I could completely get on my feet. Once her college was over, she was planning on moving to Colorado and I would then find a place in the city to live.

When that time came, she had a couch she wanted to get rid of (this was in lower Queen Anne). I told her just to put it on the street, there was already another couch around the corner on the same block. It wasn't a bad couch, it was just very heavy. She refused because she didn't want to get in trouble. I said ok, we will figure it out... maybe take it to the dump eventually or something.

She continued to stress about it for over a month.

Eventually a solution was made... she decided to cut away pieces of the couch with scissors, bit by bit, and she would buy a coffee, drink it, and then stuff the couch pieces into the coffee cup, walk outside casually as if she were a spy (pretending to drink the couch pieces) and then toss them into the trash randomly around the city so she'd never be caught.

Then we got down to the skeleton of the couch... which was A TON of wood (that's why it was so heavy) A friend from Colorado showed up after she told him of the dilemma with a saw, hammer, crowbar, etc... we went to town on that couch and disposed of the wood pieces.

It was strange, but fun... another reason why I love that gal.",,,,Roadbull,,,1470644368,t5_2qhad,t3_4wnm5b,t3_4wnm5b,44,1473284370,0,0,d68si6r,Seattle,44,,

"It's because that extra two feet can be valuable when carrying oversized loads.  Frankly, this *all* falls on the driver of the oversized vehicle, the driver of the pilot car, and the hauling company.

- The driver of the oversize vehicle is responsible for knowing his load height.  A hauler I've worked with before has it in their manuals that the driver must personally measure the load if there is any question.  That driver must also stay far enough back of the pilot car to stop in case of a problem.

- The driver of the pilot car fucked up royally by missing the sound of the height-verification antenna hitting the bridge.  That is a massive error that should see that pilot car driver drummed out of the industry.

- The hauling company erred drastically by not pre-running the route, or at least the low clearance segments, to verify where the clearance exists.  That is ""oversize hauling 101.""

The article says the state ""rubber stamped"" an oversize permit.  No, they didn't.  The hauler certified that the hauler had pre-run the route.  It is required that the hauler state that the route has been verified when the permit is issued.

&gt; It is the responsibility of the permit applicant to check, or prerun, the proposed route and provide for safe maneuvers around the obstruction or detours as necessary.

"I get that in most places, the notion of leaving your home unlocked at night is about the most bat-shit crazy idea a person could have, but BFB was only able to achieve a lot of his early exploits because of being in a pretty rural and trusting community.

Having grown up in that area and knowing the trusting nature of the community and the unusual transportation opportunities it provided (boats, cars) the lack of law enforcement resources to chase some kid around, and the geography of the area, the only thing I'm really impressed by was that he didn't kill himself in a stolen aircraft.

"I hate to keep harping on this point, but ""renters don't pay property taxes"" is nonsense.

No.  Renters don't get a property tax bill.  Their landlord does.  When their landlord gets a tax hike, one of two things happens:

a) The landlord, being a benefactor to society and a regular philanthropist says ""Oh!  Looks like I'll just have to forgo profits and pay this property tax with my own money!""

b) The landlord factors the higher property taxes into operating expenses and raises the rent the next time the lease comes up.

"Bellevue white population: 66% (1)

Seattle white population: 69.5% (2)

Bellevue median income: $86,695. Poverty rate: 6.6% (3)

Seattle median income: $67,100. Poverty rate: 15% (4)

Note that Seattle calls out family median income of $91,279, maybe because a greater number of lower-income individuals living in the city skews the median?

In short, it's incorrect to say that Bellevue is rich and white compared to Seattle. Seattle is moderately whiter. Bellevue is moderately richer--unless you look at family data (unavailable for Bellevue.) Seattle has over twice the poverty. And Seattle does a far better job (in my opinion) of presenting the data.

"Soft yes.

Been here about two years.  Frequently consider leaving. (Unmarried white 30something male, FWIW)

It's very beautiful here, and I've found fine friends and things to do, but overall I just get a ""meh"" as far as a life long place to settle. Nothing terrible about the place, but sometimes a city just isn't the right fit.  I'm not a very naturey outdoorsy guy, and I neither enjoy, nor can even really tolerate seafood, coffee or weed.  I don't know if it's that I'm a relative conservative in a liberal area, but people seem pretty die-hard on their opinions here too (I don't typically discuss politics or ethics amongst friends, just the times it comes up, it seems intense); I lived in New Orleans for several years, and I dearly miss the laid-back attitude and *open* friendliness there. People could laugh and get over a disagreement in a heartbeat.  I've met an oodle of friendly people here, but it was more of a ""get-your-foot-in-the-door"" kind of social scene. I don't enjoy the city infrastructure; tough to get around, and the good places I want to be are just a bit far for my enjoyment when plotting escapades.

I do love the nerdy culture that exists out here, and consider that a true jewel among American cities (i've not tried SF or austin yet).  The weather in the city also agrees with me (perfectly content with the 3ish months of beautiful sun, and the 6ish months of moderately temperatured dim days).  And, of course, the jobs; can't really beat seattle for a good job market in a couple industries.

If I were to leave, I'd likely go back to Philadelphia, where I'd come here from (though not my city of origin).  Good growth in some job sectors (not mine, but I imagine I could find a job again regardless), lots to do, and a more centralized city.  What it lacks in majestic mountains and seas, it makes up for in proximity to the other great cities of the East (NYC, DC, Jersey Shore for day trips; Boston, Pitts perhaps on a long weekend). No one in my experience had been vehemently stanced on issues such as city policies &amp; politics (could be good, could be bad), gentrification, or even, despite its reputation, sports teams (yes, they threw batteries at santa 30 years ago and a smattering of other shitty things since, but that's only been the kooks at the games themselves, it's much more palatable in the city).  Downside is that it's not very clean, and violent crime rate would be higher; also state income tax, though I think it breaks about even (I haven't done the math) when compared to WA food &amp; liquor taxes combined with your vehicle registration fees and the like.  Perhaps it's just that I crave more of a city/urban lifestyle that I don't get the feeling for here (though perhaps I've just not been here long enough).

I'm enjoying time well enough here, and I don't intend to bash seattle.  I'd certainly recommend it for anyone who thinks they'd be into it;  it's just not the ride-your-unicorn-to-work-down-the-golden-roads-while-high-on-life paradise that public opinion had given me to idealize before I'd gotten here.",,,,Orleanian,Broadview,,1470089295,t5_2qhad,t3_4vovkn,t3_4vovkn,28,1473143801,0,0,d607ieg,Seattle,28,,flair broadview

"$500,000/12 houses = $41,666.67 per house to have a sidewalk.  Build on a 50 year bond, comes to about 50 bucks a month each house to have a sidewalk.  And here's the crazy part.  Having a sidewalk also improves your property value.  I'm surprised that building sidewalks in all neighborhoods in Seattle isn't a zero sum game where the increased property values and subsequent increased property taxes would cover the costs and then some.

4. The Reasonable - maybe the frequency of accidents at certain crossings is indicative of an infrastructure problem that could be alleviated with any number of reasonable changes that don't include getting rid of bikes or street cars.

The implied solution of ""build more lanes"" has been shown to be ineffective, as more people will switch to driving the moment traffic problems ease substantially. 

It's implied that bus lanes should be given back to general traffic. First off, author apparently does not understand that one bus every once in a while can carry more people than a steady stream of cars. And suuure, let's take away the bus lane, so the bus sits in traffic, loses its advantage, and half the people riding go back to driving because the bus isn't better for them.

Killing 11 of 90 members of an endangered species for the death of 12 cows - a very not endangered species - just seems utterly fucking total batshit koo koo insane to me.  They were just doing what wolves do.  Did we expect them to live a vegan lifestyle and only eat organic produce?  I think they are a bit far from the local Whole Foods or Trader Joes.  

I would much rather our goverment reimburse the ranchers (not really but would if it was the only choice) for the cows and not kill the wolves.  Besides, how many thousands of dollars are they going to spend on the team and helicopters to kill the wolves?

"&gt; double the cost of the project, and delay it considerably for the sole purpose of subverting the intent of a state law.

Except that's not how I read what the SDOT person said.  He said that SDOT is trying to do the work with its own crews--people who are getting paid anyway--and trying to show actual, delivered results quickly.  To put the contract out for a bid means a) the results take longer to deliver because the bid process is glacially slow, and b) the contractor has an incentive to run up the price because it's a per-bid job that SDOT can't internally bid against.

So, yes, ideally the job would have been done as one contiguous segment costing ~$180,000.  But state law doesn't allow for SDOT to do the work in-house if it costs $180,000 so they are doing it as two $90,000 jobs (one in 2016 and one in early 2017) to avoid a situation where the whole job costs $190,000 and is only started in late 2017.

"This change is coming at an interesting time where I do not know where I fall on the issue. On one hand I do think that the reason behind trying to push for change in this area is a good one, but on the other, I would not have gotten the rental I am about to move into under this ordinance. 

My roommate and I recently found a house for rent for a reasonable price and contacted the owner to convey our interest. The owner called me and had about a 30 minute conversation with me about myself and my roommate. But this wasn't focusing on our jobs, income, or background, they were trying to understand what kind of renters we would be. This included asking about how much experience we had gardening, if either of us were handy and could fix things ourselves, if we would be interested in improving the house to fit our needs (which the owner would pay us an hourly rate to do if we were interested in painting or w/e). The owner explained that she keeps the rent low so that they can screen through her renters for people with the experience and willingness to care for their home over a long period of time. My roommate and I were about the 8th applicant that had passed the base requirements, but our experiences and skills in homecare were what made the owner choose to rent to us.

I'm having a hard time picturing how they will continue a policy like this under the new law since many of the things they were looking for would be hard to put in has strict requirements on applications as it seems more that they feel out a lot of the factors over conversations with applicants.

"&gt; Home prices in King County have gone through the roof.

Agreed.

&gt; Property assessments have as well.

If by this you mean that the values of those houses, as appraised by the Department of Assessments, have gone up, then agreed.

&gt; Higher assessments means more property taxes collected.

~~Nope.~~  Well, yep, but not as much as you might think.  Washington State has a 1% max rise in the amount of overall property taxes collected in a district.  Hypothetically, if a district collected $1,000 in taxes in a certain year, it could only take in $1,100 in taxes in the year following.  Its tax rate is, by operation of law, rolled back to the rate that would collect $1,100 based on the new appraised values of properties in the district.

There are, of course, exceptions.  The two big ones:

- So-called ""new money.""  If a parcel is appraised at $10,000 but someone buys that parcel, demolishes the existing structure, and builds a gold-encrusted palace complete with wall and diving pool, that now appraises for $1,000,000, the districts containing that parcel don't have to abide by the 1% cap for the $990,000 of ""new money"" put into the parcel.

- Levy lid lifts.  These are voter-approved property tax exemptions to both the 1% cap and the state law cap on how much a district can levy in taxes (its rate).  Some districts, like the City of Seattle, have ""banked"" lid capacity by which those districts raised their taxes at a slower rate than allowed by law in the past so they're allowed to ""overshoot"" the max rate cap, but not the 1% rise-in-collections cap.

That *your individual taxes* have gone up doesn't mean that everyone else's in the district went up.  Some people's taxes, like mine, actually dropped from last year to this year because their parcels increased in value but the additional taxes were absorbed by the new money exception earlier (one of a myriad of examples) or their parcels rose in value but not as fast as surrounding parcels.

(By the way, after all of those words, did you notice something?  The 1% year-over-year rise cap is between 1 and 2 percentage points *lower* than normal inflation.  That means that the effective value of those taxes collected shrinks every year.)

""Districts,"" in this case, means every government entity that is able to levy a property tax.  The state--which has a separate cap--counties, cities, schools, RTAs (there is only one right now, the Central Puget Sound Regional Transit Authority, or ""Sound Transit""), libraries, waster/wastewater, fire protection, and so on.

"Often, it's not really rubbernecking at fault. When the car stalled, if it slowed down traffic temporarily during rush hour, it can create a standing wave in traffic that can't dissipate. People have to slow down because the car in front of them slows down, and then the car behind them does the same, and it just keeps happening for hours at a time.

Sometimes, a single person can cure this by leaving a big flexible gap between their car and the one in front, letting it soak up the slowdown. But often they can't, because people start jumping into that lane because they think it's faster. If it starts to dissipate in one lane, people try to get into that lane, cut people off to do so, and reinforce the slowdown in their wake.

"The big picture timeline which I might be wrong was, it was a stable owner for decades (""Ed,"" the guy in the mirror shades on the old mural outside depicted saying ""I love you people"") ..

The old original Comet 1.0 -- I've forgotten why it was always ""The Real Comet Tavern"" --  was a beer and wine bar only, in the ancient Seattle tradition of the Liquor Board not allowing hard liquor unless certain conditions were met (not serving food was a major one) .. which the Comet did not meet. 

This bar was used by night workers in Seattle from the 1960s to mid-late 80s.  By the late 80s, new arriving rock musicians are starting to discover it and make it their go-to.  Quite a few of them get turns being bartenders, one in particular (a drummer) was a bartender at The Comet for years, while he was also playing in several bands around town.  

But despite this, Comet 1.0 had no rock band stage.  It did occasionally host shows, but they tended to be after hours parties.  The upstairs (just that one level visible now from the bar) was closed off and sealed, office space or storage.

Then around 2002 or so Ed or Ed's estate sells, and the new guy gets his hard liquor license, and puts in the stage.  Comet 2.0 is born.  The grungy white walls with decades of smoke and graffiti history, left by thousands, are painted over at this time.

This is the Comet I think a lot of /r/seattle thinks of when it says ""The Comet.""  The local rock band space with purple/lavender walls.  This is run by the guy who isn't paying his staff, and who runs into ""lifestyle challenges"" and goes broke.

Enter Dave Meinert.  Around when was it, 2010 or 2012, Meinert develops both the space around the corner as Lost Lake, which I believe had been either a word-of-mouth invite-only bathhouse, or a band rehearsal space called The Blue Room, or both... and gets ahold of the Comet, scrubs it down stem to stern, the years' worth of dollar bills on the ceiling mysteriously vanish, and .. Comet 3.0 is born.

Comet 3.0 has all the look of 2.0, but without the rock music, and with now the upscale neighborhood around it.    ",,,,my_lucid_nightmare,Capitol Hill,,1471538438,t5_2qhad,t3_4y9mz1,t1_d6mr9gy,10,1473475287,0,0,d6msgf5,Seattle,10,,flair

"I hate the BLM so much. Federally protected lands in Nevada, made to preserve wild mustangs, is being used by cattle ranchers. They round up the wild horses with the excuse that they cannot survive/too many for their own good, but basically they are giving the land to ranchers. The wild horses are then held at taxpayer cost, or sold to slaughter.  The horses are round up by basically using a helicopter to run them to exhaustion in super hot weather. Some are injured, some perish at the lot because they aren't fed the right food. 

A woman named Madeline Pickens used her own money/resources to start a sanctuary for some of these horses, on private land that she purchased. Someone recently broke into her property and purposely destroyed the water sources for the horses, causing at least a dozen of them to slowly die of thirst in the desert. The BLM and Ranchers have supposedly been very against her eco-tourism proposal for her sanctuary.

"Hi, I'm a volunteer at Seattle Humane, particularly in Adoption Services.

Why do you say that Seattle Humane makes it hard for people to adopt? Our processes are pretty similar to other animal shelters, and much less stringent than most rescues. We take the time to sit down with each potential adopter, make sure they understand the necessities of owning a cat/dog, and also take the time to go over the personalities of any pets they are particularly interested in to make sure that they are the right fit for the family. You're going to be hard pressed to find a place that will just let you walk in, say ""I want that one"" and leave within 5 minutes; and if you find one, it's most likely a city/county shelter that is underfunded and also doesn't have the strong network of volunteers that Seattle Humane does.",,,,oreosprinkles,,,1470239324,t5_2qhad,t3_4vw5i5,t1_d62gl9b,13,1473175581,0,0,d62lc9t,Seattle,13,,

"I was a nanny when my oldest was born. The single mom was working full time, but her kids were great with my baby, and interacting with them was more interesting than just taking care of a baby that just slept/ate/pooped.

A nanny share would work well, if you found someone whose schedule complemented yours. Or even as they got older, a share would work for them to care for a couple kids at the same time.
Two kids can be easier than one.
But watch out if they are too quiet!

I don't know much about finding one.
People may link up on neighborhood facebook groups, or if your birth clinic had after baby comes classes, people connect that way.
I haven't seen any child care centers that took infants that I would recommend, personally. Babies are tough, but also fragile.
I think a nanny share, or at most a well run home day care, is best for under one yr. 

Imo, they need stability, and it is preferable to have a consistent provider, rather than a center which may have high turnover.

But if you just need a little flexibility with your current shared schedule, you may be able to find a baby sitting co-op, where you take turns with each others kids. 
(I didn't know about this organization when my kids were little, but others have raved about it)
http://www.peps.org

I know you didn't ask for parenting advice, but I have so much, and I only have puppy grandchildren so bear with me.
��

Unless you have made the agreement before kids for one partner to do most of the domestic stuff, try and find help that will enable both of you to have some free time( including together) and to both participate in domestic chores.

Don't align duties based on how much money each partner contributes to the household. Caring for tiny kids &amp; house, is very time consuming and can be mentally and physically exhausting, but at the same time- (and I know I will get downvotes for this but I don't gaf, ) not very satisfying.

Yes I love my kids very much, but you can be on your feet all day, only sitting down to pee ( which you never do alone) but feel like you didn't get anything done, let alone have time to further your skills and connections.

I do think caring for children is important, and people that chose to do so should have higher status (&amp; pay) than they do.

In fact, I will be volunteering with one of our citys outdoor preschools this year and I am looking forward to it very much.

"I definitely had my drink spiked at Neighbours once. 

It was at an event for which those side ""stage"" areas were reserved for VIP people. Me and 2 friends bought out the side stage near the bar, and we could just reach down for our drinks without ever leaving the side stage area. As a result, we were probably less than attentive with our drinks, leaving them up there unattended to go dancing - nobody entered our booth but thinking back on it the drinks were almost certainly within arm's reach of the dance floor below. 

I had one fairly small drink that night (vodka cranberry, I think, but this was a year and a half ago so who knows), and at the end of the night I don't clearly remember getting home. I remember my friends walking home with me and at one point I remarked about how terrible I felt, how one drink could not possibly have done to me what this one drink did (and when I say this, I actually do mean it - the glass could have been literally pure gin, which it wasn't, and I would not have been drunk enough to feel that terrible afterwards). Then I was sick for about 3 days after. 

I might have been more inclined to do something other than sleep it off had I not had friends around - being alone would likely have prompted me to report it, because I definitely knew something was wrong.

Dear 
Apparently the Washington Department of Fish &amp; Wildlife has announced it will kill the entire Profanity Peak wolf pack. I am appalled at the nature of this proposal - wolves have only recently been brought back from the verge of extinction in Washington State, and to even consider culling them when they pose no harm to humans is a ridiculous concept. Yes, they have taken cattle - this shouldn't matter in the least. If the cattle ranchers are concerned, then they should move the cattle to more appropriate grazing lands, away from the threat. Wolves are an alpha predator, few in number and important to the ecosystem - cattle is not. Take the money away from the subsidized ranching &amp; put it towards wildlife conservation, and see just how much noise ranchers make. If they want to use public lands to graze on, then they need to accept that there are risks associated with such use.

Then I told his dad, who said, of course, because you are prey. Not literally, of course, but that's what it's like for women, and I don't think most men are aware of it. I'm middle aged now, and I still get cat called, and feel unsafe when men approach me in public. I don't think most are aware that they come off as a threat. 

Nothing at all to apologize for. I know the feeling exactly, and I constantly fear making some guy angry, and causing him to do something to hurt me.

Memory of that will fade and nobody will care.

Overheated growth makes the city more money faster, but it also displaces more people faster.  All it is.

On the other hand if you're thinking of packing it in a checked bag and you're going to a non-legal weed state, then you could be in for a whole heap of trouble since TSA do have drug sniffing dogs doing random baggage checks. It's probably not a high risk, but still significant.

There are new apartments or condos going in across the street that will bring a lot of new residents into the area, and Shoreline is launching a major revitalization project for the piece of land that Central Market and Sears sit on as a major retail/entertainment destination so they are pretty focused on keeping that area in pretty good shape.

"&gt; As an out-of-stater, this is the most confusing set-up I've ever seen.

As an in-stater, what confuses me while driving is taking a right turn onto Broadway. I have to pause and remind myself to go around the bike lane, and not turn into it! I'm guessing that's what happened with the car in the photo.

&gt; Does the parking meter dispense parking tickets for multiple spots that you then take back to your car?

Yep.

&gt; And what is the blue curled tube, just a bumper?

Those were art installations, but I believe they've all been removed.

&gt; Opening the driver's door looks scary!

Traffic usually doesn't move all that fast on Broadway since this reconfiguration, so that helps in this case.

&gt; Admittedly this is safer for bikers. I get that. But it looks confusing as heck.

Yep. I wish they'd done this on 12th or Harvard instead. I'm not sure how many cyclists even use this. For them, sharing a street with the streetcar can be bad news because of the tracks, so I think a lot of them find alternate routes.

&gt; So that's a 2-way bike lane? Like it's own little separate side road?

Yep.

"I'm posting this from inside the Evil Empire itself (Bay Area).

The reasons I believe are true are:

- Lots of people in Northern California accept out of necessity a 2+ hour commute as normal.  Seattle hasn't hit that tier yet for the most part.

- If a Northern Californian owns a home, they can sell in Bay Area for 100-300 thousand more than any reasonable home will cost them still in Puget Sound.  So it's a cash gain for them to cash out of the Bay Area and move north, keep working.  This is a treadmill with a 20 year history btw.  I knew people in mid 1990s who were employed by Silicon Valley tech who were moving here to keep working in tech, but were enjoying the fantastic cash payout of selling their home in the Bay Area and then getting into our market flush with cash.

- We have loads more wildlife and green outdoors.  One thing you are struck by, as a resident of the PNW, upon spending any time in California is just how brown it is.  Northern California is green and brown mixed, Central / Southern California is solid brown unless it's been irrigated.  Some people don't care, but the ones we get talking about moving north all cite the beautiful green forestland as part of why they love the idea. 

- The economic equation in Seattle is still more friendly to high-end earners than it is for California.  Let's say you're a senior dev.  In both cities you might pull from $150,000 to $250,000 a year salary.  That money goes a lot further in Seattle than it does in Northern California.  Also - and this gets more important the more money you earn - no state income tax in Washington State.

- Puget Sound culture and climate is almost a match for Northern California.  Not an exact fit, but more alike than say moving to Texas or New England or Atlanta or DC or New York.  

- It's possible to move here for work but not completely lose your friends in the Bay Area.  There are dozens of cheap flights back and forth a day.

"A police station near Aurora and 85th seems like a good idea, a great idea. It's a terrible neighborhood.

Does it need to be snazzy? Well, it shouldn't bring down morale just to work there.  It should be something we are all proud of : a public building for public servants, usable for decades to come.  

Now, does this design need to be built? I dunno. I'm not am architect or a civil engineer. Nor am I a cop. I'd like cost prudence to be used in design, but with an eye toward building a 50-100 year piece of solid useful beauty. 

Edit: I also have a different view of costs. 200M is *not* outré when you consider major costs for engineering projects or companies. It's just a number. What's the ROI? That's the question to be answered.

I don't give a CRAP about defunding the police. Most folks I see and talk to want more cops. We have stupid high property crime levels, we need to have more walking cops downtown.

"This law devalues all subjective values all landlords would make, even though some of them ought to be protected (or at least respected) by the same reasoning that justifies this law.

I'm imagining a small, old widow having to rent to an unconscientious, belligerent young man. There's an unjust power dynamic there as well. Dude thrashes her place just like she thought, since he said his main concern was having a big space for parties, pushing her further toward being unable to provide for herself. Plenty of other such examples.

I understand landlord hate, but was also along for the ride when my partner rented out his house out of state that the bank wouldn't let him sell during the housing crisis. Small scale landlords are really defenseless. They wrecked the house and skimped us on rent and there was nothing we could do that was worth doing. When they left we said screw it and let the place foreclose, not that we could afford any other option. We weren't even allowed to upkeep the place the entire year we were waiting for the bank to take it (all this at the bank's direction) so of course the grass was a fire hazard, junkies moved in, *really* wrecked the place, and one *died* in the backyard.

"...wait so this is actually moving forward and will become law? Ugh. Are they not thinking more than one step ahead?

I see this making it *more* difficult to find a rental:

- Landlords will opt not to ""officially"" list the rental and simply ask friends/acquaintances for applicants and screen those the same as before the law.

- Or, landlords will simply make their screening criteria over-the top (e.g. perfect credit score, $200k salary, and able to sing that one song by The Crash Test Dummies perfectly) and then screen as before.

- Better yet: how long before someone creates an app that just spams a rental application at every craigslist listing the moment it shows up? Or do they really mean first-come, first-served down to the microsecond?

At best, they've created a race to get an application in, which sure seems to penalize people that work odd hours and don't have a car...you know, some of the very same people this law is attempting to help.

"We had a raccoon that decided he lived on our second floor balcony for the better part of a week. I noticed him when my dog started barking at the balcony. I lifted the blinds and there he was, sitting in the cushioned deck chair out there on his raccoon butt like he was doing a human impression. 

I thought he looked a little rough, like he might have been clipped by a car, so hubby and I just let him be for a couple days since he was just... Sitting there like a person and we hate to interrupt a good lounge. Eventually, though, he got up and started coming and going, and after he pooped out there we decided that was enough. 

While he was out hubs cut down the branch he was using to climb from the adjacent tree onto our balcony. Dude was *pissed*. He hung out in that tree for like three days and every time we'd come out he'd just chitter angrily at us. It felt like I had evicted a raccoon squatter and now his hobby was hurling raccoon profanity at us. 

Also a drunk dude once climbed up onto the same second floor balcony at like 1 am and scared me senseless. Again, my dog started barking at the door and my first thought was 'oh, that raccoon managed to find a way to get back onto the balcony'

Nope. Drunk dudebro.  In keeping with the rest of this thread he was wearing a deep v-neck tee with a picture of a rooster on it and I am not making that part up. ",,,,BiasCutTweed,West Seattle,,1471977843,t5_2qhad,t3_4z3z6u,t1_d6su4da,11,1473561791,0,0,d6tlhbq,Seattle,11,,flair

"Tapping is required everywhere because the agencies use that data to determine how to split the revenue from a pass.

For example, if you have a pass that costs $100/mo and you only ever ride sound transit, then sound transit gets the entire $100. If you ride sound transit and then transfer to metro, they split the revenue with each other.

If you have a monthly pass and don't tap when riding, the agency transporting you might not get paid for that ride.

"It does seem insane. But the whole situation is really philosophically complex, even without dragging in various ""advocates"" on both sides.

Philosophically, we're born on earth, and it would seem we have a natural right to live free as we please outdoors as long as it's not on/in someone else's ""home"" and we're not disturbing people. 

People have lived in the bush and the wild *forever*: Even the various Prophets--Christ, Mohammed, Buddha, Krishna, Baha'u'llah--took off to the wilderness for extended periods, essentially being ""homeless.""

But now that every inch of land is becoming ""owned"" privately or ""publicly"", that natural right is being eliminated. It's a cost of our current legislated and regulated society. Just like how dogs and cats are no longer allowed to live free. (Which is also crazy when you think of it: how can we say whole *species of animals* are not allowed to live free, and we'll round them up and ""home"" them or kill them if we find them attempting to live free?)

It's really a mess actually. To what degree do we legislate and regulate for society's good, and override the natural right to live free? And would that make our Paragons of virtue, the Prophets, also outlaws? Now they'd have to get a 2-year camping permit, etc to take off to the wilderness. Or they could be shot as trespassers if they were on private wilderness property.

That's the wilderness, eh? But the dilemma isn't removed by virtue of taking place in a city, either, I think.

If the landlord decides to be a mega-dick and changes the locks on you or anything rather than complying with your reasonable demand for pro-rated rent, then congrats, you've just won the small claims court lottery and you'll be getting more back than half a month pro-rated that's for sure.

"I was very concerned with the story on the front page of the Seattle Times Friday (http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/environment/profanity-peak-wolf-pack-in-states-gun-sights-after-rancher-turns-out-cattle-on-den/).

I spent hours today researching the situation.  There is plenty more to learn, but I already found a lot more than has been in the news.  The more information I find, the more upsetting the story gets.  There are more details elsewhere on Reddit, but I found some interesting tidbits on the WDFW website.  The most concerning is this (from http://wdfw.wa.gov/publications/00001/).  The state is currently in the process of locating and shooting via helicopter 11 wolves (the entire Profanity Peak pack).  There were only 91 wolves total before this killing began.  I believe 6 have been killed so far, including possiblly a breeding female.  That leaves us with only 86 of this once native species left in our state.  Here is the concerning part:

The recovery objectives for downlisting and delisting wolves were developed from a combination of current scientific knowledge about wolves in other locations and in Washington, wildlife conservation and population viability principles, and discussion among the Wolf Working Group, with input from WDFW, scientific peer review, an analysis of assumptions and risks, and changes made by the Fish and Wildlife Commission. Fifteen breeding pairs, which represent an estimated **97-361 wolves, are considered minimal to achieve recovery**

So the state has not even reached the levels they stated as necessary to give the wolf population viable chance of long term-recovery, yet they are now spending taxpayer dollars to kill 1/9 of the remaining population in Washington.  This is simply unacceptable.

If you have studied ecology much, you'll understand how devastating this could potentially be from a genetic diversity standpoint.  Furthermore, this is not ideal from an overall ecosystem development standpoint.  Wolves are a keystone predator that regulate the entire ecostem and even climate.  (watch this video for more https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysa5OBhXz-Q).  Personally,  I find it disheartening simply from a moral perspective that the government is spending my taxpayer dollars to kill a largely endangered species that was once native to this land.  

(I found it a little confusing figuring out whether or not the wolves are endangered.  It sounds like the federal govt considers them endangered, but they are only threatened according to the state government in the eastern third of our state.  But they are certainly endangered in the western 2/3 of washington)

My heart does go out to the farmers effected by wold depredation.  However, killing wolves is simply a foolish and reprehensible choice in this situation.  The farmer lodging these complaints has been offered generous compensation for his losses, but refuses them because he thinks that accepting the money is impliciting endorsing the wolves, and he, bluntly, seems bent on eliminating these wolves.  He refuses to coexist.  

Biodiversity is valuable to the many, many members of our state, but a stubborn few ranchers are stealing this value from us, and getting at most a minor inconvenience removed for themselves in return.

I don't know why the WDFW is acting the way it is, but I strongly feel the people of Washington need to make it clear we value biodiversity, and will not tolerate it when our elected officials take that away from this for the sake of special interests.

Does anyone have any ideas what to do next?

"The arguments against park and rides always seems a bit earnest to me. The fact remains that lots of people live in areas where taking a bus isn't feasible. If you want to get someone from their exurban sprawl to a city core, is it better to have them drive the least congested miles, park, then take a train or to have them drive the whole way?

I understand that in a perfect world we wouldn't have free parking. I accept that automobile drivers are the most subsidized people in our society. But I also don't want people driving from the outskirts of Issaquah to downtown Bellevue if they can park a mile or two away in Issaquah and take public transit to Bellevue. 

If we could charge for parking everywhere we might have a chance to combat free parking. But we can't and we won't.

**Guy threatened me and my family for ferry line cutting**

*****

Today, my family came to visit my wife and I for the first time since we moved to Seattle a year ago.  We decided to head over to Vashon Island to check it out, excited by the beautiful day. We drove through West Seattle to catch the ferry and passed the park to get in line. A lady behind us kept honking her horn... I thought, oh am I not pulling up enough? So much honking... Is my car on fire? What the heck? I get out to see what's going on, I'm about 3 feet from her window and I ask politely if everything is ok.

She lays into me about how I'm a cutter, and basically every way I'm the worst person in the world and she's going to report me, etc etc. It was as if I was sub-human, so much hatred and rage in her voice.  ""Huh? I cut I line? I had no idea, I'm sorry. Where did it happen and when did I get in front of you? Where did the line start?"" I just wanted to understand what I did and what to do now.

She just kept yelling at me, so angry at me for something I had no idea I had done and I was quite confused about.  I didn't see any signs, there were no lines on the road when I got in line, there must have been at least three or four car lengths or I would have noticed a line.  It was my first time ever dealing with this ferry. I honestly didn't know how to respond to someone so angry. I just said again that I was sorry, I can see why she was upset, but that she must be a really good person all the time to be so angry at someone for making an honest mistake.  I walked away, noticing a huge gap in front of me in line, I needed to move my car and explain to my family.

Now there's a huge gap in front of me, so I pull up and while doing this, I'm explaining to my family that I guess we cut in line.  We're talking about what to do, and not three minutes later, a man behind the honking lady comes up to my car on foot. He's so irate, he's shaking. He yells at me threateningly, scares my family. My sister starts crying.  He leans into my car and starts pointing his finger in my face. He shaking a angry. I start to calmly explain to him, like the lady - but then my dad (who is usually a very nice and thoughtful man) gets upset and tells the guy to eff-off because he was way out of line. It was awful.  I ended up turning around and going home, after collecting myself enough to drive.  It made me angry, something I don't like being.

My entire family was very shaken, scared, and upset by the hostility and lack of civility of these people.  We feared for our lives, having seen on the news how these things can go when people approach a vehicle in rage on foot. We made an honest mistake, just trying to enjoy a nice day only to have these vigilante types assume that we were come kind of degenerate criminals.  How are we supposed to know if there are no signs, no markings, no obvious line start?

I've only lived in Seattle for about a year now. I've met very nice people here, but I've also experienced the Seattle freeze.  And now this. :(

I'm reminded of this brilliantly thoughtful commencement address by David Foster Wallace.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CrOL-ydFMI&amp;amp;t=5m47s

I post this hoping to put out there something more positive than this residual mixed feeling of rage, embarrassment, fear, and sorrow left now late at night. We can choose how we feel, we don't have to accept the ""default setting.""  Be kind and search for understanding, even of those that transgress -- they might be decent people just like you.

Even downtown, a lot left untended for a season would be overgrown. In the wet months, blackberries spread so wildly, so rapidly that dogs and small children were sometimes engulfed and never heard from again. In the peak of the season, even adults dared not go berry picking without a military escort.

Each precinct has a couple desk officers, typically nearing retirement or on light duty for injury or something, to handle walk ins. Otherwise, civilians handle phones and administrative duties, for a lot less money. Detectives are assigned cases to investigate and they do not patrol. There are a lot of different units for each type of crime (as well as employee background checks, media relations, and so on) each with many detectives, a couple of sergeants, a lieutenant, a captain and so on.

"Getting passed with 6"" difference is scary when a car is going (say) 55mph on a country road and thus the speed difference is large and there may be a gust of displaced air. When the speed difference is small, I personally don't need that 3 feet of space. (Don't take that to mean that other cyclists agree, can't speak for them.)

I guess you look like a steady driver and the cyclists trust you to not suddenly veer one way or the other. All you need to do is keep driving straight. 

Above all, what I as a cyclist would like to see from drivers is predictable, rule-following behavior [1]. 

Example from recent experience: I signaled a left turn with my hand (as there was a car behind me). An oncoming car slowed down to let me make the turn as if I was a pedestrian who had right-of-way. That's kind and well intentioned, but I'm not going to turn in front of oncoming traffic, and you're not really saving me any time. Just keep driving and I'll turn when you pass. Thanks!

16000 have moved here each year 13000 units have been built, rents are still skyrocketing and the vacancy rate is flat.

Keeping that in mind, I think I have an idea to improve Metro's efficiency. If they run the buses *after* rush hour, they can get more buses through, and provide the same number of bus trips for a much lower cost (why pay drivers to sit in traffic?!) In fact, I'll bet if they really worked the schedule, they might be able to get all the bus routes for the week completely finished by Tuesday night or Wednesday morning. Then, they could take the rest of the week off and save millions of dollars!!

"&gt;And with no sense of irony, you generalize Trump supporters and right wingers in the middle of your argument about there not being such a thing as the left. 

A fair point, but I think months of MAGA on line has tended to prove that there is a very consistent set of values that Trump supporters bring.

That's kind of been their challenge all along.  The major appeal of Trump is to very narrowly tailored demographics, and he's had a ton of trouble expanding his footprint beyond it.

So I think, irony or no, there's some validity to lumping most Trump people into a narrow definition.

As opposed to say Bernie supporters versus Greens versus Hillary supporters, all of whom are considered ""the left"" to most pro-Trump commenters.

"Here's a decent example with recent events: http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/28/us/a-battle-to-keep-trees-or-an-industry-standing.html

Basically, the Forest Service builds roads into public forests then auctions off the timber to private companies. The Forest Service sometimes spends multiples of what it makes from selling the timer to build the roads supporting the logging companies:
&gt; The Forest Service gets at most a few million dollars a year from timber sales, but spends multiples of that to support logging.

It's a double whammy: not only does the public lose the value of the trees that are cut down, we also paid for the privilege.

The cycle goes as such: timber companies run out of places to log (they've clearcut all the land they own too fast: the trees they've planted to replace are too young). The industry suffers, lobs are lost, etc. They lobby the Forest Service to release more land to be logged. The Forest Service spends public money to build roads to support these companies logging in public land who then privatize the profit until they are again out of land. 

What especially bugs me is that the old growth trees that are cut down are generally shipped out of the country over to Asia. We're essentially exploiting our forests just as South America is exploiting the Amazon. The public gets robbed to prop up failing private companies.
