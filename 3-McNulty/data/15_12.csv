"This is a terrible PSA.  For there to be any chance of traffic working well and all of us getting to our destinations safely, we have to play by the same rules.  When a pedestrian standing at a crosswalk MAY or MAY NOT want to cross, it causes a lot of confusion.  The law gives the pedestrian the right of way in most situations, and if a ped dithers and dawdles when it is their turn, the driver can't know what their intention is.  This is a recipe for a chaotic and dangerous approach.  If you don't want to cross, don't stand at the crosswalk facing the street.

"Definitely understand the concern. Property crime has been a major area of focus for our burglary, auto theft and Major Crimes Task Force teams over the past year. Our command staff has put a major emphasis on using data and analytics to prevent and disrupt crime trends (more on that on our [SeaStat](http://www.seattle.gov/seattle-police-department/crime-data/seastat) page) and we've seen a 10-percent reduction in property crimes citywide since this time last year. There's still room for improvement, though, and we know that it can be frustrating to wait for or hear stories about a delayed police response to a property crime. Four hours isn't an acceptable response time and we're working to enhance our service so that folks aren't left waiting. 

As for car prowls, we track that data through SeaStat to help direct patrols, but that's one crime that sometimes doesn't always get reported, and thus we don't have that important data to let us know an area needs our attention. If you see someone prowling a car or poking around at one in a way you think is suspicious, please don't hesitate to call 911. If it's well after the fact and you do see a prowled vehicle, you can attempt to report it via 625-5011. However, as we require the victim of the crime to make a 911 report, you might also consider flagging it under ""miscellaneous"" in the [FindItFixIt app](http://www.seattle.gov/customer-service-bureau/find-it-fix-it-mobile-app) or sending info via our [web contact form](http://www.seattle.gov/police/contact/). But, again, ALL crimes in progress should be reported to 911! 

Finally, we can assure you that patrol officers aren't being diverted to parking enforcement duties. That work is performed by civilian employees, rather than sworn patrol officers with badges, handcuffs, etc.

"If Mr. VonSassypantz works 40 hours a week (full time) and receives very little pay (minimum wage), he is likely already living with no luxuries.


If, on the other hand, he quits his job, moves into free housing, and gets his food from charity, he now has 40 hours a week to do what he wants.  That, in itself, is quite a luxury.


But let's say Mr. VonSassypantz really likes videogames.  He wants to buy a new one every week.  He may be able to earn enough for a videogame with just a few hours of work, or by doing something he enjoys.  Again, this is more luxurious than toiling away in a job he dislikes for minimal pay (he can't even afford videogames after paying for food and rent).


This is the ""donut hole"" of welfare, and why even some heartless STEM majors like me support basic income.  Basic income eliminates the donut hole.  If you don't work, fine.  You live a more frugal life, and your basic needs are covered.  If you want to work, great.  You have more money to afford luxuries and your basic needs are covered.

From what I remember some Christian group lobbied to ban drinking from strip clubs in the state. They thought it would make the clubs loose their appeal and they would shut down. The unintended side effect was that since drinking was no longer allowed the age a person had to be to go to one went from 21 to 18. Now teenagers can skip church and go to the strip club. ,,,,Dognutz1,Marine Area 7,,1449381857,t5_2qhad,t3_3vlvji,t1_cxomvps,13,1451468013,0,0,cxovfsi,Seattle,13,,flair

"This researcher was speaking in Seattle, on data about Seattle, relevant to Seattle's economy and policies.

&gt; According to Pastor, Seattle particularly suffers from what's known as the ""Colorado paradox,"" which means that our economy looks good but it ain't good. We import a lot of people with college degrees who work at high-earning positions, but our economy is failing the people who were born and raised here, the ""home-grown"" population, as Pastor describes them.

&gt; To illustrate this point, Pastor showed that Seattle is ""leading the country"" when it comes to increasing the gap between the professional class (households at the 80th percentile of income distribution) and the working poor (households at the 20th percentile). We're ""at the top"" when it comes to increasing the gap between low wage job generation and affordable housing production. In last year's lecture, he elaborated on these numbers by saying that high wage jobs generate these low wage jobs: ""Behind every software engineer is an army of nannies, gardeners, and service workers.""

Furthermore, it will completely kill the appeal of purchasing a car now that we're in the sharing economy era.  There should be significant pushback from dealerships and car manufacturers.

"&gt;The gun/ammo tax won't come close to paying the costs the city pays for gun violence either. 

That's because its not a real tax, its backhanded regulation. The two dedicated gun shops will close, and the larger stores that sell ammo will probably suspend or roll back sales in response to it.

The cost it will have to pay a city employee to count up the nickels this will bring in, will far exceed what it contributes. Not to mention the legal fees defending it.

&gt; My point is you're required to pay lots of fees to drive a car, including insuring against potential damages. 

property damage. The suggestion from this conversation about the tax is, its needed to cover ""hospital costs"" from violence.

"Seattle resident here. I've managed to stop most of the junk mail that had been showing up in piles since I bought my house. 

The Big opt-out organizations (DMAChoice and CatalogChoice) are reasonable attempts at solving the problem, but don't come close to eliminating junk mail. Opting out with these is super easy, so you might as well.

The main strategy I used is persistence. Every piece of unwanted mail you received demands a response. Pretty much every business and organization has a website with a contact form or email address. Most of the big direct mail companies like Valpak and RedPlum actually have opt-out forms (and they do work, they just take a few weeks to kick in):

https://www.valpak.com/coupons/show/mailinglistsuppression
https://www.redplum.com/tools/redplum-postal-addremove.html

Most other businesses that are going to send solicitations or catalogs will have a website. Whenever you get a piece of junk, Google the company that sent it, find their contact info and send them a quick email:

""Please remove my mailing address from all promotional, marketing, newsletter and catalog mailings (all residents) [insert address] Thank you!""

Quick and polite. I kept this as a text file on my desktop for a while. This usually works, but not always.

One of the stickier catalog-senders I dealt with was Kohl's. I think I had to send them 4-6 emails, plus a phone call, to get them to stop sending me seasonal catalogs. Having Gmail was handy for this, because I could search though my old sent messages and actually pull the dates out of all the times I requested to be removed from their lists.

Credit card offers are tricky. A lot of the big banks hide their contact details and forms behind a login, meaning you can't reach out unless you have an account. You'll need to give those places a call. Credit card banks really are the worst. You're breaking their customer service scripts from the beginning by not having an account and not wanting an account. But, again, be persistent and polite. Most of the time the person on the phone really wants to help you, they just have no idea how. 

Finally, there's the junk you can't stop. The United States Postal Service has a service called Every Door Direct Mail (EDDM, https://www.usps.com/business/every-door-direct-mail.htm). This is a program that allows businesses to target specific areas and blanket them with flats (double-sided thick paper advertisements) addressed simply to ""Postal Customer"", ""Resident"" or other generic titles. USPS offers no opt-out method for this program, which seems pretty shitty to me. I'm not sure how effective it was, but I once tried emailing the company that sent me one of these flats (Munchery.com) asking to be removed from their list. When they replied saying that opt-outs weren't possible, I started bitching about it on twitter. Ideally, companies shouldn't be using advertising services that are going to annoy potential customers. 

The only thing left are political flyers for local candidates. I've tried emailing and calling these people, but they give zero shits. It's not like they're selling anything. Politics is all about name recognition. If I care enough to write them a letter, then their name is in my head and the junk mail did its job. 

Finally, the job is never fully over. Every time you buy something online, purchase a ticket to an event or give your address to any business anywhere, you're basically giving them the OK to send you shit in the mail. Every time you give your address to a new company, expect them to send you something you don't want, and except that you'll then have to ask them to knock it off.

"A lot of irrational responses so far.

I think that this is the only option for the state moving forward. They make a ton of money of fuel taxes and electric and more efficient vehicles are dipping into that and will eventually take it away.

Here are basic rebuttals to common arguments:

#This unfairly hurts the poor/rural/my nuts
No, it doesn't. Instead of these people paying taxes up front and hidden inside the price per gallon, they simply are paying for it at the end! And since EVs tend to not be cheap, this will actually help those who still use conventional vehicles more!  Those people are the poor.

#I don't want the government tracking my data.

Excellent point, we need no-bullshit legislation that actually draws hard lines on how the government treats data. The government is tracking us already (or has potential access to things that can track us), why don't we have legislation already that clearly allows us the freedom of privacy as much as possible.

But, data is good for local government. It helps improve everything about how they provide our municipal services. Better sequences in lights, more busses where we need them, more help in planning for where congestion lies. It will also decrease our reliance on 'studies' since our state is a constant study!

#This is more expensive for EVs than it is today!!!!!! Why should I pay more?

Why should you pay less? You're not saving the planet.

#I don't know how anything works but I have an opinion on everything.

No you don't and yes you do.

How is it detrimental? These units are heavily inflated per square foot, are not affordable, are sub-standard quality, and are only acceptable to a small demographic sub-group: people who live alone and can afford to eat out for almost every meal.

"It taxes 5 cents per bullet.

I buy bullets that cost 7 cents.  It's a 71% tax.

---

EDIT - I just found out that the original proposal was changed, so that for ammo .22 or smaller it is a 2 cent tax.  2 cents on 7 cent ammo - which is a 28% tax.

The 5 cent tax is still applied to all calibers above .22 - one of the most popular is 9mm, which you can pick up for about 15 cents, which is a 33% tax rate.

Strangely, the larger and more powerful the ammo that you buy, the lower the tax rate.  Ammunition for an AR-15 (5.56x45 NATO) runs about 35 cents each - or 14% tax.  If you want to pick up a few rounds of .50 BMG - a round powerful enough to penetrate an engine block - that'll be a 5 cent tax on $2.50.",,,,CyberBill,,,1450847732,t5_2qhad,t3_3xwc9j,t1_cy8hzdg,14,1451809660,0,0,cy8nl4z,Seattle,14,,

Heart Attacks and heart problems are bad.  I'm sure UW could always use extra money to study heart disease.  

Maybe Seattle should impose a tax upon red meat, fast food, sodas, sugar, or any number of other items to are a contributing factor to heart disease.  To be equal, lets say the tax is great enough that any business selling one of these goods would be unable to stay in business within the city.  They would each be faced with the decision whether to close up for good or move out of the city... Everyone would still eat just as poorly, you would just have to drive a little farther to get the ""bad"" food.

"So I'll try to explain how something like this would work, without using too much Cop speak.

I get called to a suspicious person/trailer/tent/campsite where someone has a collection of parted out bicycles. I arrive and I find exactly that, something that appears to be a collection of stolen bikes. There are two dudes with the bikes. At this point, I have Reasonable Suspicion (Not Probable Cause, its important to understand the difference here) that some sort of criminal activity is afoot. I can detain the men, identify them, and investigate. Unfortunately in situations like this I rarely can develop Probable Cause for an arrest as even if the bikes had a serial #/DOL # on them, which some don't even have that, there is no state-wide registry of stolen bicycles. There is NO bicycle registration, like u/ThurstonHowell3rd asked above, so even if I find a serial # if the bike was not reported stolen, to the agency that I work for, there is nothing I can do.

This is a situation where I hope that the dudes with the bikes have warrants.",,,,Krankjanker,,,1450682846,t5_2qhad,t3_3xmanx,t1_cy65lpf,10,1451770280,0,0,cy6drw8,Seattle,10,,

"&gt;media's general attempts to either ignore or stifle his campaign on their own

There's not a conspiracy to deny Sanders coverage - the 24 hour news media is much more interested in Trump because Trump generates clicks and views. The same shit happened in 2008ish with the Tea Party - there's even the same shitty reporting/spin being done about the demographics of the supporters. Early media reports about Tea Party members falsely identified them as a ""diverse"" group that consisted of moderates and even some democrats. The reality was that the Tea Party was the same demographic that has always been attracted to the US's particular brand of rightwing reactionary movements: old, white, christian, and worried about their place in the world/country being usurped by undeserving women/minorities/jews/catholics etc. 

Annnyway, Trump is a continuation of the Tea Party movement - and the outrageous things he says gets people to listen because they hate it or because they agree. Win/win for a media system that revolves around generating outrage (notice how we all suddenly were supposed to care about what some dumb Yale undergrads think and say as if college students saying dumb shit was a new thing).

"For almost 50 years now, Seattleites like have [voted down](http://seattlish.com/post/83663717975/on-blast-90-years-of-fucked-up-seattle-public) any efforts to make modern, functional, forwarding thinking programs to create transit and better transit infrastructure. 

* In 1968, voters approved the Kingdome, but rejected transit  

* In [1970](http://www.seattletimes.com/business/economy/the-mass-transit-system-seattle-might-have-had-jon-talton/), voters rejected four transit-related bonds, causing the federal government to reroute transit aid to Atlanta instead of here.  

* In [1972](http://metro.kingcounty.gov/am/history/history-1970.html) voters allow a small transit tax for busses, but reject the tax for electric rail. (Even the meager vote for busses was the first time Seattleites approved new taxes for transit since 1918)  

* In [1995](http://metro.kingcounty.gov/am/history/history-1990.html), voters reject a Regional Transit Authority (later Sound Transit) measure for a gigantic, $6.7 billion transportation system over three counties that would’ve featured commuter rail, light rail, express buses, and expanded HOV lanes 

* In 1999, with Initiative 695, local voters show their love of Tim Eyman and regressivism- scrapping the progressive car excise fee for a super-regressive $30 state car tabs. Since 29% of the vehicle excise tax went to local transit, local communities have been scrambling to keep their buses running ever since. 

* In 2002, voters showed their hatred of forward-thinking transit/infrastructure funding and support an Eyman initiative yet again: voters approved I-776,which restricted local governments from adding their own excise taxes and limited local license tab fees. While the measure was shot down at first for being unconstitutional, it was upheld by the State Supreme Court in October 2003. 776 repealed many taxes that the public had [already voted on](https://researchcouncil.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/initiative776.pdf)  

* In [2005](http://www.seattlepi.com/local/transportation/article/Monorail-will-go-to-voters-for-5th-time-1183631.php), Mayor Nickels gets the ""all-or-nothing"" plan for a West Seattle-Ballard monorail on the ballot. The plan is a watered down, poor version of the original, so it failed. Its rejection gutted Seattle Monorail Partners, which had been working to upgrade our transit system since they were created by a public vote in 1997. Council President Jan Drago (accurately) expressed fear that not building the monorail segment means ""we will pass it to future generations."" **Now look where we are!** 

* In [2011](http://seattlest.com/2011/07/13/last_night_people_are_voting_with_t.php): The Congestion Reduction Fee. When our regressive and outdated sales tax revenue plummets during the recession – the King County Council approves a $20 fee on vehicle tabs to make up the $60 million deficit, collected in 2012  through 2014  

* In [2014](http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/with-transit-money-approved-seattle-pledges-to-spend-new-dollars-well/), Seattleites vote *FOR* maintaining some bus transit, with more regressive taxes - a $60 car-tab fee and a 0.1 percent sales-tax increase - to keep many bus lines from being cut and to expand services on a couple bus lines. 


Just think where we could be now if voters hadn't rejected mass transit on multiple occasions and hadn't supported regressive taxation and Tim Eyman's anti-transit, anti-infrastructure initiatives. ",,,,BillyDBilliams,,,1449268683,t5_2qhad,t3_3vfzjx,t1_cxng1me,21,1451443748,0,0,cxngpua,Seattle,21,,

"A couple years ago my wife was in a nasty accident on 45th, where a driver didn't see a red light and drove full speed through an intersection and T-boned our car, totaling it. I wasn't in the car at the time, but if I had been, I likely would have been killed - the damage to the area the passenger would have been was that bad. Luckily it was about a block and a half from our apartment so I came out to help her because she was seriously shaken up. 

Turns out it was an elderly couple from out of town who got really disoriented and didn't realize there was a stop light there. We made sure nobody was seriously hurt and called the police to come take a statement since the other driver was completely at fault, and we thought that was what you were supposed to do in situations like that. I described what happened and that our car was in a bus stop zone and totaled so badly that it couldn't move, and the dispatcher said they would send an officer as soon as one was available. 

This all happened at 7:30~ pm in February so needless to say it was cold as fuck. We waited there for 5 HOURS and no officer ever showed up. We even saw 3-4 cop cars drive down the street PAST us while we tried to flag them down (45th is a super busy street) and none of them stopped. Someone will probably tell me we were dumb for waiting there like that and it would have been fine to just exchange insurance info and deal with it from there, but I had never been in a situation like that before and since our car was so completely fucked and it was through pure negligence on the part of the other driver, I really wanted to get some sort of official statement so the insurance company couldn't screw us over. I just always have had it in my head that outside of fender-benders, the way it's supposed to work is: make sure everyone's ok, exchange info, call police, get incident report. 

Eventually we gave up and were going to let the other drivers go and call a tow-truck for our car but when the other driver tried to leave they couldn't get their car to start, so we both needed to call a truck. When one got to us, the tow truck guy takes one look at our car after we tell him how it happened and says ""holy crap, did you get a police report on this? They're going to have to buy you a new car."" I explain the whole stupid ordeal about them never showing up and he makes a call to...someone, I have no idea who, and an officer shows up within 5 minutes. He writes down the report and states that it was the fault of the other driver, and voila! the insurance company eventually gives us the totaled value of the car. Took maybe 15 minutes from the time he arrived to get it taken care of. 

So no I don't really have a good impression of their reliability or responsiveness. It's possible that they were understaffed that night and had other things taking up their time, but the quickness they showed up after the tow truck guy made his call and the fact that they would have had to have had ALL their officers busy for 5 hours seems unlikely. I think they just assumed it was a fender-bender and weren't going to come out at all.

The cop was plenty nice once we finally got him out there though. ",,,,Ygg999,,,1449107082,t5_2qhad,t3_3v6o9u,t3_3v6o9u,25,1451403541,0,0,cxl5a51,Seattle,25,,

"Like any other city, Bellevue has different areas. Someone already mentioned Lake Hills - it's nothing like downtown. Downtown is the core of the city, but is pretty stale and heartless. It's designed around a few malls with little infrastructure. The main developer, Kemper Freeman, isn't a fan of transit. Thus there's horrible traffic in the downtown area. Of course, he's been working on being allowed to fly in and out from his own helicopter to avoid the mess he's made.

There's a new area popping up called the Spring District. It's a mile outside of the main downtown area, bordering highway 520, and on the eventual light rail route to Microsoft (about a mile away). This will be pretty much the standard mullet of development (business on the bottom with the apartments on the top). Hopefully they'll get some good, local, restaurants as the downtown Bellevue area is overrun by chains. There's some escape over on Main St.

There's also the Factoria area, which I know little about other than there's a mall there as well as a few corporate businesses.

There are also lower income areas with multiple nationalities represented. There's even a methadone clinic in town, bringing some color to the area of 140th and BelRed Rd.

But the areas outside of the downtown area, other than the upcoming Spring District, are more single family houses as opposed to places that 20-something singles would live (if that's where you fall). The area near the Bellevue College (formerly a community college) will have more people in that age group though. I don't really know what there is to do around the college though, as it's mostly residential. I'm assuming the 20-somethings either go downtown Bellevue, downtown Kirkland, or into Seattle to blow off steam. 

It really depends on what you're looking for. But don't expect things to necessarily come cheaply around Bellevue. But it's less than 10 miles from Seattle too.",,,,eyeswydeshut,,,1450767112,t5_2qhad,t3_3xssqx,t3_3xssqx,10,1451790447,0,0,cy7jk9s,Seattle,10,,

"To allow people to consume created images of child abuse is at just the basic level a crime against the child. Think about that. Essentially the government would be saying that its ""okay"" for people to view this person(s) as a helpless youth in what is probably the lowest and scariest place in their life. By creating a library of this the government, regardless of the reason, would at that point be condoning and encouraging the consumption of some of the most vile shit created by man. Then we move on the the psychology aspect of enabling the behaviors associated with CP. You are familiar with thrill seekers probably? Well the same sort of thing manifests itself in they who seek out CP. The library of ""approved"" images will eventually not be good enough for they who need more and society is still back at square one when the deviants seek more or try to produce, and the cycle of victims continues. At the very least it would make it even that much more easy for CP to be viewed when for now, the individuals who seek it out have to be in the know and at least somewhat technologically adept. 

The vast majority of these people don't get in trouble because of the nature of our government, the nature of investigative procedures and actually getting charges to stick. The fluidity of the internet means that there might be 25k suspects... but file names can be misleading, people download porn carelessly and end up with shit they don't want, malicious injectors etc. but they still get flagged. Every suspect needs to be investigated because who knows if its some idiot or an actual criminal deviant. The vast majority of these people don't get in trouble because the police and society need to catch and destroy the creators of the content because that is all that can realistically have an impact and be achieved. Everything is a numbers game and the fact is until we have access to quantum computing and sophisticated enough programs things will be done with man hours and there isn't enough in the country to handle 25k suspects. Do you want to know an estimated number of they sharing CP around the world? 3.2 million. That is a number from a forensics journal specifically about child abuse.

"For almost 50 years now, Seattleites like have [voted down](http://seattlish.com/post/83663717975/on-blast-90-years-of-fucked-up-seattle-public) any efforts to make modern, functional, forwarding thinking programs to create transit and better transit infrastructure. 

* In 1968, voters approved the Kingdome, but rejected transit  

* In [1970](http://www.seattletimes.com/business/economy/the-mass-transit-system-seattle-might-have-had-jon-talton/), voters rejected four transit-related bonds, causing the federal government to reroute transit aid to Atlanta instead of here.  

* In [1972](http://metro.kingcounty.gov/am/history/history-1970.html) voters allow a small transit tax for busses, but reject the tax for electric rail. (Even the meager vote for busses was the first time Seattleites approved new taxes for transit since 1918)  

* In [1995](http://metro.kingcounty.gov/am/history/history-1990.html), voters reject a Regional Transit Authority (later Sound Transit) measure for a gigantic, $6.7 billion transportation system over three counties that would’ve featured commuter rail, light rail, express buses, and expanded HOV lanes 

* In 1999, with Initiative 695, local voters show their love of Tim Eyman and regressivism- scrapping the progressive car excise fee for a super-regressive $30 state car tabs. Since 29% of the vehicle excise tax went to local transit, local communities have been scrambling to keep their buses running ever since. 

* In 2002, voters showed their hatred of forward-thinking transit/infrastructure funding and support an Eyman initiative yet again: voters approved I-776,which restricted local governments from adding their own excise taxes and limited local license tab fees. While the measure was shot down at first for being unconstitutional, it was upheld by the State Supreme Court in October 2003. 776 repealed many taxes that the public had [already voted on](https://researchcouncil.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/initiative776.pdf)  

* In [2005](http://www.seattlepi.com/local/transportation/article/Monorail-will-go-to-voters-for-5th-time-1183631.php), Mayor Nickels gets the ""all-or-nothing"" plan for a West Seattle-Ballard monorail on the ballot. The plan is a watered down, poor version of the original, so it failed. Its rejection gutted Seattle Monorail Partners, which had been working to upgrade our transit system since they were created by a public vote in 1997. Council President Jan Drago (accurately) expressed fear that not building the monorail segment means ""we will pass it to future generations."" **Now look where we are!** 

* In [2011](http://seattlest.com/2011/07/13/last_night_people_are_voting_with_t.php): The Congestion Reduction Fee. When our regressive and outdated sales tax revenue plummets during the recession – the King County Council approves a $20 fee on vehicle tabs to make up the $60 million deficit, collected in 2012  through 2014  

* In [2014](http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/with-transit-money-approved-seattle-pledges-to-spend-new-dollars-well/), Seattleites vote *FOR* maintaining some bus transit, with more regressive taxes - a $60 car-tab fee and a 0.1 percent sales-tax increase - to keep many bus lines from being cut and to expand services on a couple bus lines.

"How about instead of all this lane by lane social engineering, we do something far more simple.

Remove the massive amount of subsidies around driving.  If people had to pay closer to the true cost to build and maintain infrastructure for driving, it would make the case for better public transit and the cost for such would seem more palpable.  By some estimates, drivers underpay by almost $1,100-$1,800 a year per household.

It would require an entire rework of traffic funding from federal, state, and local, so it will probably never happen.  It could easily be tied to income, so those who don't live in the city due to cost, but have jobs downtown aren't hammered.

"This is a crazy idea and more of a thought  experiment.



What if a subset of already existing CP was made legal? The intent would be to drive demand down for new ""content"" thus lower the amount of new abuse.


My first objection is that demand for this isn't driving  the abuse. But from the article:


&gt;He recorded the assaults on video, taking requests from fans while terrorizing his daughter. 



So at least in some cases the ""consumers"" are dictating the abuse. 



Why not just prosecute them all instead of making some CP legal? From the article WA has 17k leads on suspects just from peer to peer sites. At times as many as 25k. It would take an incredible amount of manpower to research all of them. Unfortunately I just don't see it happening. 


If this worked and new ""content"" dropped off it would have the added advantage of leaving a smaller pool of abusers to target for investigation.


For the victims it would be devastating to be forced into having your abuse made ""okay"" by making the images legal. That's a problem with this idea. Perhaps it could be ""opt-in"". 


I'm against CP. But the problem is so big that current laws are not enough of a deterrent.

"Here's my assessment:  
(Edit: in no paticular order)  
  
1. **Maple Valley**: You will get a lot of house for $600k in MV, but the commute and the schools will be less than desirable compared to other oprions.  
  
2. **Sumner**:  Again you can get a lot of house for $600k, the schools are about the same, but your commute will be much better...you get that small town feel,  but with more, and closer amenities...and you will pay lower taxes being in Peirce County over King County.  
  
3. **Tacoma/Lakewood**:  You can get a lot of house for $600k...there are probably only a couple school districts that are good though, and not close to the Sounder; [however a link light rail extension to the Sounder Station was just approved and will cover those coveted neighborhoods](http://www.soundtransit.org/tacomalinkexpansion).  There is also talks of running the Sounder more frequently throughout the day and not just during the commute..in my opinion it will be almost certain that Sounder gets dedicated tracks now that the oil export ban has been lifted and rail traffic will intensify.
  
4. **Issaquah/Sammamish/North Bend/Snoqualmie**:  Arguably better than Maple Valley in every way and still in the foothills of the Cascades...You won't get as much of a house for $600k (probably a townhouse in Issaquah) and the Sounder isn't a commute option...but there is the Eastgate P&amp;R a short commute away by I-90.  
  
5. **Eastside/Bellevue**:  This is probably  the best school districts in the state.  You're not going to get a lot of house for $600k and most in that price range are considered tear downs...but it really is a matter of perspective, the houses are very liveable but not $2M Spec McMansions.  As far as a commute you have the option to drive, or there's a decent bus system if you can find parking at the Park and Rides.  
  
6. **North Neighborhoods**: I'm not as familiar with these areas, but there are transit options (light rail expansion to Lynnwood and regional bus service. and the housing gets cheaper as you travel north as the commute gets worse.  There is also the North line of the Sounder that goes to Edmonds, Mukilteo, and Everett. It also gives you the option to live on Whidbey Island and Ferry to the Sounder Station at Mukilteo or live on the Peninsula and take the Kingston Ferry to Edmonds...however these commutes are probably the least reliable due to slides closing down the North tracks and or Ferry issues.

"&gt;Remember though, voluntary (or first degree) manslaughter requires ""malice"" and even involuntary manslaughter requires ""criminal negligence"".

I don't know all the case law, but the word 'malice' does not appear in the statute for any of first degree or second degree homicide; nor first or second degree manslaughter.  What differentiates first and second degree manslaughter per the statute is recklessness, not malice.  First degree requirement recklessness, while second degree requires only negligence.

Satterberg should have been free to use his prosecutorial discretion in deciding whether or not Birk was merely negligent (he freaked out and shot somebody he shouldn't have, per your example) or was specifically reckless.  Were I in Satterberg's shoes, I certainly would have considered the way Birk stopped his car in the middle of the intersection and took only 9 seconds between first shouting instructions to Williams and fatally shooting him as evidence of 'recklessness' in a plain English language interpretation of the term.

Regardless, I don't think any disagreement we might have over interpretation of the statute is germane to the bigger point.  Yes, you're correct.  The shield law exists because of the theory that cops should get more of a free pass when it comes to negligently shooting people due to the nature of their job.

"Uber has been spending [millions](http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-uber-california-20150726-story.html) of dollars on lobbying against employee organization and unions [across the country](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2015-06-23/this-is-how-uber-takes-over-a-city):

&gt; Although Uber promotes itself as a great disrupter, it’s quickly mastered the old art of political influence. Over the past year, Uber built one of the largest and most successful lobbying forces in the country, with a presence in almost every statehouse. It has 250 lobbyists and 29 lobbying firms registered in capitols around the nation, at least a third more than Wal-Mart Stores. That doesn’t count municipal lobbyists.

For example,

&gt; Last year, **Uber put more than $600,000 into a voter referendum in Seattle** and spent $314,000 lobbying in Washington, D.C. The Portland campaign looks quaint by comparison. Uber reported spending about $68,000 on outside lobbyists in Portland and Oregon in the last two quarters.

**Of course Uber doesn't want their employees to have any bargaining power. This is the entire basis of their business model: at-will, disposable employees which bear all of the risk and liability of the business.**

Last year, Uber announced it got more money from venture capitalists than any other company, putting its value at around $40 billion - higher than American Airlines.

Yet Uber employs roughly only 1,500 people directly. The rest of its “employees” – the drivers who use their own cars - take on almost all the cost and risk. In fact , Uber demands drivers handle any and all damage claims themselves through their own personal car insurance, even though those insurance companies don’t cover commercial activity. [These](http://robertreich.org/post/109894095095), drivers use their own cars, take out their own insurance, work as many hours as they want or can – and pay Uber a fat percent. 

Worker safety? Social Security? Uber says it’s not the employer so it’s not responsible. Uber drivers aren’t insured to drive others for money. Which means Uber riders won't collect if there's an accident.

Defenders of on-demand work emphasize its flexibility. However, unpredictable work hours increase stress. According to polls, almost a quarter of American workers worry they won’t be earning enough in the future. That’s up from 15 percent a decade ago. Irregular hours can also take a mental toll. Studies show people who do irregular work for a decade suffer an average cognitive decline of 6.5 years relative people with regular hours.

Defenders of ""on-demand work"" point out that as on-demand work continues to grow, on-demand workers are joining together in guild-like groups to buy insurance and other benefits.

But, notably, they aren’t using their bargaining power to get a larger share of the income they pull in, or steadier hours. **That would be a union – something that Uber, Amazon, and other on-demand companies don’t want.**

Disposable labor and poor returns to employees are a great business model for mega-companies in the new economy. It just isn't a great model of stability, work and income for the millions of Americans with little to no other choice.

"At Pioneer Square, tap the card going in, and you are charged $3.00.  Tap the card going out, and you will get a refund of $0.25, $0.50, or $0.75 for not riding all the way to the end of the line.  Rates will drop to $1.50 in a few months if you have an Orca Lift card, available to low income residents.

You can see a full breakdown of cost here: http://soundtransit.org/Fares-and-Passes/Link-fares

The system assumes if a tap out doesn't happen, you rode to the end of the line. There is a time limit before it assumes another tap is a new entry, can't remember what heard Fare Enforcement say it was. Saw someone on my way to the airport a few days ago be walked off the train and issued a $125 fine for their second failure to pay, and a warning with an explaination of the system to another passenger nearby.

Getting used to tap on and tap off will save more money as the system continues to expand.  The end of the lines are currently Westlake and SeaTac.  Soon it will be the University Stadium and South 200th Street.

It is a bit confusing for new user of the system.  I'm hoping that signage improves in the downtown stations when the busses are removed from the tunnels later. I still double check every time that I'm on the right side for the airport runs from Westlake, and frequently have tourists asking to verify. If they used the LED signs in the waiting areas more effectively, it would help so much.  Currently they seem to only light up when a train is already pulling in, leaving some people scrambling to rush up stairs and down the other side.  Other cities with these small rail lines have much clearer and simpler instructions and signage recognizing the shared use between residents and visitors. Here, I'd guess odd politics between the mixed agencies having to work together to provide bus and rail service in the same spots.

"Ok. This is actually one of my favorite little nuggets of PNW crazy I've run across. I found a little trip down the Internet rabbit hole a year or so ago that concerns this person. Enjoy. Since then I've seen similar posters hung around BellTown, Capitol Hill, and Fremont. Warning, there are several Facebook links in this post. I would normally not condone linking to Facebook, but in this case, it completes the story. Click at your own risk.

Now, those Facebook links I provided you. This first one is a thread about a random homeless man walking unclad around kitsap. In the comments, you see Lilly add in that said homeless man is her friend Robert Henry Hall who helped her shoot Some tribute music videos for her incarcerated husband.

"TL;DR: A stack of 6 computer fans in my window as a ""whole house fan for a rental"" worked wonderfully in keeping the heat down and the house comfortable.  This summer was significantly hotter than previous years we've lived here, and our house was significantly cooler and more comfortable this summer than any previous summer because we had good forced venting to draw cold air through at night.  Paired with a filtered intake downstairs, we barely had to use the window AC at all this year.

If you're fighting with keeping your place cool in the summer, I'd strongly suggest building something like this - it really works wonders, and also deals with houses that aren't reasonably lined up with prevailing winds.  I was forcing hot air out ""against the wind,"" which box fans and the like simply won't do, because the hot corner of our house happens to also face into the wind.

Talk to the person, ask what their story is and why they're in your car instead of in a shelter or a tent city. This person is probably not newly homeless and so may not be getting off the street soon. Do a gut check whether you're comfortable having them stay around your house before you make any promises.

Make it clear that you will regularly inspect the car and will call the police if there are any signs of illegal activity. (Needles, stuff that looks like it may be stolen.) Follow through on this.

"Google Hugh Sisley and you'll find lots of stuff to read over.  

Here's one of my favorite stories, as summarized in a Seattle Weekly article:

&gt; Sisley also earned a much less amiable reputation for hiring bouncers as rental managers. The most 
&gt; notorious was a swaggering neo-Nazi gun runner named Keith Gilbert, who managed Sisley’s 
&gt; Roosevelt properties and enforced rental policies. Gilbert once did federal prison time for conspiring 
&gt; to 
&gt; dynamite a stage where Martin Luther King Jr. was scheduled to speak. He was sent back to the 
&gt; lockup after a 2005 bust for possession of illegal weapons, including two machine guns. He 
&gt; expressed 
&gt; remorse only at being separated from his pet Blondi, a snarling German shepherd he named in 
&gt; memory of a dog owned by Adolf Hitler.

Differences between homeless YYA and homeless adults?  Young people have often not yet lived on their own and are learning life skills.  They are learning how to do their laundry, make macaroni and cheese, navigate the FAFSA process, open a bank account .. All without a safe adult in their life to support and mentor them.

Young adults are have still developing brains and decision making skills up to age 25.  There is a reason why adolescents are as challenging as they are at times [any parents in the Reddit community today?] as they're are still forming as adults. [mg]


Count Us In is our community’s count of homeless and unstably housed young people ages 12-25. In 2015, 824 homeless young people were counted at more than 70 partner locations across King County; you can learn more about the 2015 count at http://allhomekc.org/the-problem/. Count Us In data is collected through a one page survey completed by young people; one of our partners for this effort is the Seattle Public Library. Consider volunteering and help our community gain a better understanding of the experiences of homeless youth and young adults! 

Volunteer opportunities are available at 7 different Seattle Public Library locations: Central, Capitol Hill, Broadview, Ballard, Columbia, Southwest and University. Volunteers should be available to attend a training prior to the count, either in person (preferred) or over the phone. In-person trainings will be held on Wednesday, January 13th from 11-12:30 at Street Youth Ministries (4540 15th Avenue NE, Seattle 98105) and on Thursday, January 14th from 3-4:30pm at the 2100 Building, Community Room B (2100 24th Avenue S., Seattle 98144).

"Man there is a ton of whining on that petition. We get it everyone hates tolls. Would what they are asking for be good?

&gt;We are asking for legislators to lead WSDOT to make these changes to the I-405 Express Toll Lanes: 
1. Eliminate all tolling and restore I-405 ETL to standard 2+ carpool lanes. 

This would drop the average speed below federal standards and remove federal funding for the freeway. Congrats! you just moved a toll from users of the freeway to the state general fund, while making the road more expensive at the same time.

&gt;2. Eliminate the double lines and allow drivers the freedom to enter/exit those lanes as they see the need.

Double lines are widely accepted to reduce crashes, and limit lane cheaters from jumping in and out. I am sure there is DOT study somewhere on it.

&gt;3. Allow all drivers to use the carpool lanes for free during late night hours as it was before. 

I too remember Tim Eyman initiative I-985

&gt;These changes will result in: 
1. Increased participation in carpools

prove it, with you know data. 

&gt; 2. Better utilization of all 5 lanes of traffic while still meeting performance goals for the Federal funding 

That's what we had pre-tolls, and they weren't meeting the speed standard. Also as population increases, its not going to  get better.

&gt; 3. Improved overall drive times for everyone at all times, regardless the distance they are traveling, their ability to be a carpool or their ability to pay the toll

This is dis-proven by travel times before tolling.

&gt; 4. Increased safety 

not if you roll back things like double whites

&gt; 5. Increased public satisfaction

only for tax haters who want more road subsidies

&gt; 6. Lower operating costs of the highway

not when you lose federal funding

&gt; 7. Reduced taxation

Absolutely not, you will move the tax from the direct users, to the state general fund. It doesn't go away it just gets paid by people who don't use it as a subsidy. Whats that called again?

"I imagine that dog fighting is the only place where you'd want an aggressive dog. But, dog fighting is a terrible thing. 

If you mean a police or military dog when you say ""fighting dog,"" then here's a brief explanation: Dog aggression is not the willingness of that dog to participate in dangerous activities such as boar hunting, personal protection, what have you. Aggression typically boils down to either a fear-motivated reaction or a dominance behaviour. An aggressive dog is a dog that makes its own decisions about what is a threat. 

A dog that is well-suited to protection training (or boar hunting, etc.) is going to be a dog that is 1) courageous enough to participate in those kinds of activities (not prone to fear-aggression) and 2) obedient enough that it will risk its own life/call off target on command from its handler (not prone to dominance aggression).

"Additionally, if you dig a bit on that site's archives, there are some articles that discuss how difficult it actually is to file suit for misconduct and win. 

Furthermore, the state of Washington has tort reforms that make most misconduct cases financially untenable for lawyers to take on. In fact, most of the attorneys I interviewed in Seattle admitted that they turn away most clients who have legitimate cases because they just wouldn't win enough to make the case worth taking on.

Once you consider that, it's clear that settlement payout is a poor gauge of misconduct that vastly underrepresents the true scale of the problem.

&gt;How we got here

&gt;Back in 2003, when the Internet was barely past a twinkle in Al Gore’s lusty eye, we began as an email newsletter in New York that highlighted the best bar and restaurant openings each day. From there, we expanded to LA, Chicago, San Francisco, and most of the rest of the meaningful world. We were also once home to a little something called Thrillist Nation, which dutifully covered everything important in life NOT involving food and booze. These days, its rampaging spirit lives on at our brother sites Supercompressor and JackThreads.

Yes. aPodments exist only through a legal loophole, which allows them to classify the units as ""sub-units"" and not separate units in and of themselves.

"Libertarian, right-wing critics of public unions always attack teachers, and almost always remain silent or defend police unions.

It's one of the great ironies of American politics today that one of the major political tendencies proclaims its first principle to be resistance to the tyranny of ""big government,"" and that that very same tendency has championed the expansion of the police state, and defended officers who arbitrarily arrest, beat, and murder people on the street.

In other words, they support the tyranny of big government. But when they say they oppose ""big government,"" they aren't thinking about unaccountable, militarized police  — they have in mind the terrors of public education and Social Security.

Rush hour on 405 was a crapshoot before.  The HOV lanes were crowded.  My commute could have been 25 minutes to 1 hour (or more when it got *really bad*).  It was hard to plan for.  Now, I plan for a 30 minute commute, and if it gets too congested, I pay the extra $1-$4 when I'm not carpooling.

"My Leroy's story I re-post every time I see a Leroy's reference or a suit buying question:

Long story.

Way back in high school in the mid 1980's someone told me an urban legend about Roger Mosley (aka TC on Magnum PI &amp; had a bit part in McQ). The legend was that he was on the gameshow $25,000 pyramid. He and his partner got to the last stage where he would give clues and the partner/contestant would answer ""Things that are ____.""

If the partner could guess enough right answers she would win the $25,000 prize.
Things are going swimmingly until they got to a clue and the conversation went like this:

Roger Mosley (calm): ""Purple Suit""

Contestant: ""Things that are odd?""

Roger Mosley (patient):""Purple Suit.""

Contestant: ""Things that are colorful.""

Roger Mosley (less patient): ""Purple Suit!, Purple Suit!""

Contestant: ""I don't know. Ummm... Things that men wear?""

Time is now almost out.

Roger Mosley (exasperated and almost yelling): ""Purple Suit!, Purple Suit! PURPLE SUIT!!""

Contestant: ""I don't know, I don't know. Things that are bright?""

Buzzer sounds. The contestant doesn't win. The host comes over and decides to give the contestant a couple of clues just to see if the contestant could get the answer even though the money was lost.

Host: ""A new car. A new house. A fur coat.""

Contestant: ""Things that are nice?""

Host: ""Correct.""

The host looks oddly at Roger and says: ""Purple suit?""

Roger Mosley: ""Where I come from there is nothing nicer than a purple suit.""

Fast forward about ten years. The place that I work had a very successful year. Big year end party and it is made clear to me that I have to do ""something very nice for the occasion.""

So I spend about a week trying to figure out what to do. And then into my head the answer pops: ""Well there is nothing nicer than a purple suit.""

So off I go to find a purple suit in Seattle. I try Nordstrom, The Bon, The Men's Wearhouse. Not only does no one have a purple suit, but they all look at my like I'm an idiot for asking.

A couple nights after giving up my search and knowing that all is lost, I am rolling into the BP Gas Station right next to the Space Needle at 4AM after a Saturday night of having fun. While I am gassing up my car a guy rolls up in a big Caddy. He is wearing a gray shiny shark skin suit and has three of his ""ladies"" in the car with him. He is obviously a player.

Me (Excitedly yelling like a dork at 4 in the morning): ""Oh man I love that suit!""

Player (Jazz cool): ""Thanks man.""

Me: ""You wouldn't happen to know where I could get a purple suit? I've been looking all over the city and all the shops just laugh at me when I ask them.""

Player (Still Jazz Cool): ""Oh yeah man. Go over to Lee-Roy Menswear over on Pike and 2nd.""

Me: (Way too excited by the good news): ""Oh hey thanks man. I really appreciate it.""

That next Monday I go down to Leroy's (La-Roy's) Menswear. I walk in and look at the guy behind the counter and say:

Me (very cautiously): ""Would you happen to have a purple suit?""

Leroy (looking at me like it is a silly question. The exact same look as the other stores): ""Well of course. We have several. And you have a body like a black guy. They will fit you great.""

I then tell the story of the guy in the Caddy and the shiny sharkskin suit. 

Leroy says: ""Oh yeah that is Willy T. Good customer. Big player.""

The other thing I remember when trying on my grimace colored Nehru cut purple suit, was when I asked if should have purple shoes.

Leroy: ""No way. That would make you look gaudy.""

The suit was a huge hit. I was walking down the street in it and a lady slammed on her brakes, rolled down her window and yelled: ""Damn white boy! You look great!"" Without another word she drove off.

I went back and bought another one two years later. I'm still looking for that elusive shark skin dark purple suit.

My friends would invite me to their weddings with the stipulation that I could only show up if I wore one of my purple suits.

tl;dr. There is nothing nicer than a purple suit. Shop at Leroy's Menswear. It is awesome!",,,,purplesuit,,,1449808457,t5_2qhad,t3_3wb2l9,t1_cxuygsi,14,1451573929,0,0,cxv098j,Seattle,14,,

"While I totally understand what you're saying, you &amp; everyone else should know that the difference in priority for police response isn't just about weapons, but also about time delay(for the chance of actually catching suspects) and other people involved. 

Ex: You come home to your house ransacked and burgled. You don't see any sign of anyone still inside. 

Typical response: PD will likely come over in an hour (depending on activity) to take your statement/take pictures and start a case.

Ex 2: You come home to your house and notice it ransacked. You also notice there is still someone moving inside and running away as you show up.

Typical response: immediate police response and depending on the jurisdiction and the confidence of your description police might set up a perimeter or even get a helicopter going.

In these examples the crime is the same but the police response varies greatly. 

Disclaimer: I never have worked for SPD but as far as I can tell it these are consistent industry guidelines for setting priority. Also, SPD seems to have their own shit going on-- that recent dui and run with a 4 hr response time would've been unheard of in the jurisdictions I worked.

You shoot to stop the threat, and if you can't tell if the threat is stopped or not, the instinctive thing to do is keep shooting until you run out or somebody yells at you to stop. Cops in situations like this have sometimes reported that they thought they were being shot at in return even when the police were the only ones shooting at the moment, it's very chaotic.

"&gt;although I'd agree that what he did fits manslaughter pretty well.

And that's precisely my point.  If he broke the law, he needs to stand trial.  That's what the rule of law requires of us.  The law against manslaughter exists precisely because it's not acceptable to freak out and shoot somebody you shouldn't...even when what you did doesn't meet the standards of murder in the first or murder in the second.  And the punishment needs to fit the crime.  Losing your job ain't good enough punishment for manslaughter.  It's written right into the statute.

Cops should not be above the law.

As to whether or not he's an evil guy....I'll pass.  I'm not even sure I believe in ""evil"" as a concept.  All I know is...you commit a crime, you go to jail.

"The interesting thing to me is that though the hours of daylight are increasing, the sunrise is still happening later. 

The earliest sunset (i.e. day with shortest afternoon hours of sun) was back around Dec. 8th.

Until roughly Jan. 5th the sunrise keeps getting later in the day, but the sun set is also moving later in the evening at a slightly greater rate, resulting in the increasing total daylight. Around the summer solstice the same phenomenon happens, but in the opposite direction.

"So people with money can travel faster than people that can't afford it? Still sound like a shit idea to me. 
This is specially true when you look at how it is done. Remove one lane and add one lane to a toll. The two free lanes are a parking lot, the one tolled lanes are free.

People with cash to spare spend the money and travel like kings, others stay in traffic for much longer than they used to. 

A better deterrent is to have police stay and catch lone drivers in Carpool which is 1 in every 3. THat encourages people to travel with someone else, and stay off the carpool if alone.

"Hahahaha, maybe you should read your own link past the introduction before you talk about *political science stuff* and refer to it like it's some formal term and not an overtly pejorative *reference* to the French Revolution invented solely to smear conservatives with the ""going backwards"" rhetoric.

And now we're here unironically spreading FUD about ""the Nazis"" and the ""reactionary forces.""


Hahahahahahaha

[edit]

I'll just quote my favorite parts to share what I learned with all you professional political chemists out there:

&gt; In the twentieth century, proponents of socialism and communism used the term reactionary polemically to label their enemies

I'm guessing most of you don't know what *polemically* means.

&gt; The German Nazis did not consider themselves reactionary, and considered the forces of reaction (Prussian monarchists, nobility, Roman Catholic) among their enemies . . . The fact that the Nazis called their 1933 rise to power the National Revolution, shows that they supported some form of revolution.

Wow this is such an informative link, except by the way, wikipedia is full-on shit and if you use it to research contentious topics, you should jump off a bridge.

So here's a little insight for you:

Nobody actually fucking refers to *themselves* as reactionary. Nobody refers to *themselves* as wanting a return to old policies. It is *always* an accusation, it is *by definition* a ""bad thing,"" and when you refer to someone as a reactionary -- you know, the way droves of hipsters have started referring to any middle-of-the-road conservative as ""reactionary"" -- you are essentially calling them ""bad person who disagrees with my political opinions.""

It's a smear. When someone tries to use it as a way to paint Republicans with the same brush as *literal Nazis*, you should laugh at them, and then it should make you angry.

"I'm from the East Coast, so maybe my perspective is different, but I don't get this. The winter weather and that winter 'feeling' here starts at around November and ends definitively at around March and definitely before April, if not sooner. It doesn't even snow here very much. Then in a few months, summer hits for real, and (unlike the East Coast and Midwest, even in summer) it usually never rains, ever, until summer time is over, which is a solid few months. Having lived all around the country, the lack of sunlight is just normal winter stuff as far as I've noticed, and the days here become normal length as soon as spring starts, even if its still raining.

Want to see winter? Want to see actual, no shit winter? Try living in certain parts of PA or New York and having the snow start in October, and all of the snow not melting until almost *May*.

Second year wasn't so great. The winter was long, still no friends, could not go home for the holidays... 

The third year was still not good. We decided that if the following winter was still bad we would move away. Though we did finally make 2 friends. 

Forth year wasn't good so we started to plan to move away. One of the friends we made ended up being a terrible person. We were lonely, the winters were long and dark... 

We felt sad to leave though because it is so beautiful here and we wanted it to work. We started becoming friends with a few more people then suddenly half way through the year we had the friends we wanted, the holidays weren't lonely which made the gray days not bad. 

Then we sat back and thought, we can't go. We would be doing this all over again. This year wasn't bad at all, we've finally settled in.

"I work in patrol for SPD. I'm not going to whine about my job because I love it. I just want to point out some things that have changed over the past few years. 

Staffing: Five years ago my squad routinely had 8-10 officers working a shift and about 11 on the books. The same district now has 6 on the books and we're lucky to have 4 on a given day. There have been many days where we are down to 2. The DOJ wanted a higher ratio of supervisors to officers so many sergeants were promoted out of the ranks of patrol. Things like Audit and Policies (or whatever it's called), the training unit, and the Real-Time Crime Center have further drained patrol. 

Workload: If I arrested someone for a warrant three years ago it entailed roughly half an hour of paperwork. I would write a general offense report and a booking sheet... done. Now I write my general offense report, a booking sheet, then I itemize the detainee's property on a form (which the jail already does), photograph it, have that witnessed by another officer, review it with the detainee then have a sergeant sign it. I take the photographs, import them to our system and fill out a template to relate them to the incident. My general offense report is longer because I have to fill out a detailed summary template before I even start writing my narrative (name/serial number/role of every officer, screening sergeant name and serial, was the camera on, was the video uploaded...). In addition to the regular narrative I also fill out a Terry Stop Template explaining why I stopped the person, how long I observed them before the stop, my perception of their race/gender/age. If they were acting mentally ill/high a Crisis Template is also required. The simple warrant arrest now takes about 2 hrs. If the arrested person complains the handcuffs hurt that takes another hour out of my shift, upwards of 3 depending on what sergeant screens the ""Use of Force"" and how detailed they want your UoF report. 

Call load: I log in an there is a wall of holding calls. Some have been holding for several hours. I try to clear the board but I usually end up leaving about the same amount holding for the next watch. 

Patrol is being asked to do more with less. This is causing frustration and tension between everyone. Proactive officers are upset they have no one to back them when they see a wanted person. Officers trying to handle calls are upset that proactive officers are stirring up more work when calls are holding. Dispatchers are getting testy when they can't find an available officer to respond to a holding priority call and officers are upset when they have to leave their district to respond far away. 

What I've described is an  average night. Throw in a protest downtown and the Apple Cup, things are going to get worse. I know people have brought up that those things happened before this hit &amp; run but the North Precinct did field a bike squad to address possible celebratory destruction in the University District and to support the BLM demonstration if needed. That squad doesn't just pull from the day shift for special occurrences.

It is entirely unacceptable for that hit &amp; run to hold that long but I'm not surprised by it and neither should anyone on this department. ",,,,20650Throwaway,,,1449073613,t5_2qhad,t3_3v3thm,t3_3v3thm,29,1451392385,0,0,cxkhxdn,Seattle,29,,

"You can always rent. I typically get $35/day through Enterprise. When you calculate out the cost of owning a car in Seattle you can rent every weekend and still get out cheaper than you would owning. Plus you get to drive around in a vehicle way nicer than the one you'd probably own. Also, driving in the city sucks. Ride a bike or walk. It's way less boring/frustrating/rage inducing.

Source: AAA says average cost for maintaining a vehicle is just under $9000/year (1) -- including gas and maintenance. Just rentals for every weekend of the year at $35/day comes to around $3500. Toss in another $500-1000 in gas money and you're still under the threshold. Owning a car is financially a poor decision unless you use it every day.

All a data cap does is kick in an extra fee when you go over a monthly download limit. It has nothing to do with speed or peak time congestion.

If intention of a data cap is to make thing fair between low and high data rate users then the data cap would slow down high data rate users during peak times. It doesn't.

"Just because you work at a business and dress casually does not mean you are dressing ""business casual."" If you have a business casual dress code at work that allows for short sleeve shirts and jeans then your company is doing it wrong.

Edit to add more information: ""Business casual"" actually is a standard, here is an excerpt from the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_casual):

&gt; There is no generally agreed definition of ""business casual"". One definition of business casual states that it includes khaki pants, slacks, and skirts, as well as short-sleeved polo shirts and long-sleeved shirts, but excludes, tennis shoes, tight or short skirts, T-shirts, and sweatshirts. Another source, an American university careers service, states that business casual consist of neutral colors more towards the dark shades of black, grey, navy, but can include white and off white, and reminds that the clothing should be pressed and have clean, crisp seams. The ""Dress for Success"" advice from the University of Toronto sums up business casual as ""a classic, clean cut, and put together look where a full suit is not required"", which means slacks, khakis, or skirts; blouses, polo shirts, or shirts with collar but no necktie; some sweaters; and closed-toe shoes. The Canadian university ends with the warning that ""it is not clothing you would wear to a club or for athletic purposes.... Don’t let the word casual mislead you. You still need to look professional.""
&gt; 
&gt; Another author wrote in the Financial Times that ""Ordinarily business casual for guys seems fairly clear. It is a pair of chinos, a blazer and a good shirt, no tie.""
&gt; 
&gt; A BBC article suggested that a ""safe global standard"" consists of ""a button down shirt,"" ""jackets or blazers, khaki or gray slacks, and leather shoes."" It warned, however, that great variation exists between countries and regions within countries. A British menswear store advises men to wear a collared shirt, chinos, navy blazer, and brown shoes, while making sure to look ""clean and well-groomed.""
&gt; 
&gt; A contributor to Forbes asked her Facebook friends to define Business Casual, and found an apparent consensus on ""For men: trousers/khakis and a shirt with a collar. For women: trousers/knee-length skirt and a blouse or shirt with a collar. No jeans. No athletic wear."" A response to that was ""I disagree. No khakis."" She states that ""there’s a lack of consensus in what actually defines a business casual wardrobe. All most people know is they don’t want to see too much of a colleague’s body, including feet.""

While definitions vary for what it exactly means, t-shirts and jeans are either not included or explicitly excluded. People might be confusing ""business casual"" with ""smart casual"" or just ""casual.""",,,,seariously,,,1451392454,t5_2qhad,t3_3ymo93,t3_3ymo93,-20,1451917227,0,0,cyew1a7,Seattle,-20,,

"We do have State mental hospitals here. If this guys is arrested and he is exhibiting mental illness symptoms, chances are, he will be screened by a professional clinician to determine if he is competent to stand trial. If he is, he will go through the court system as normal, however, he will most likely (in Seattle, anyway) get some sort of push toward mental health treatment if he is ill (the bar for being found incompetent is pretty high) - sometimes that can be ordered by the court and sometimes not. If he is found incompetent to stand trial, he *may* be recommended for involuntary treatment proceedings - a non-criminal process for being committed to a state mental institution against their will for treatment. 

It is a very complicated process and the bar is set high to be committed against your will. This isn't necessarily a bad thing - remember that years ago there were a lot of people locked up in hospitals that could have functioned in ""normal"" society. That said, now there are a lot of people wandering around who many think probably should be locked up in an institution. Like we shouldn't just be willy-nilly throwing people in jail/prison, we shouldn't just be throwing people in mental institutions because someone thinks they are ""crazy."". 

Trust me, nearly everyone in the criminal justice system, from the cop on the street to the State Supreme Court Justice are fully aware mental illness does exist and would prefer to not deal with these types of people in the system.

"I knew two girls from Nebraska when I lived in Portland, lived with one and the other was a friend of hers. I was inflating my spare tire one summer day and had my chains out. These two girls had never even heard of tire chains. As I'm sure you know Nebraska gets a bit of snow during the winter months and they made fun of me and my tire chains... Until... It snowed. Then they understood.

The snow we get in the pacific northwest and in the mountains is a much heavier and moisture filled snow than just about anywhere in the country. This heavy wet snow turns to a very slippery surface when compacted and also turns to ice in our daily freeze thaw cycle. Light fresh snow can actually act as a good traction surface but we don't get light fluffy snow very often. A lot of the fly over states dont see temperatures above freezing for months so the already light fluffy snow never turns to ice and it never had the moisture content to really be a problem. Also...

Tell him I need him to leave, and offer him some info/flyers, and money and/or gift cards. If he refuses to leave, or if he returns, tell him you will call the police. As soon as he's gone, secure the car doors.   

There are many reasons why a person would avoid the shelters. Maybe they had a bad experience in a shelter - got bullied or robbed. Unable or unwilling to observe the rules (i.e. arrive sober). Just plain afraid. Uncomfortable in crowded conditions.

"I'm sure there are exact rules somewhere, but the unspoken rules are:

1.  No dogs in common areas(Meeting rooms, kitchens, etc) - This one isn't followed by anyone, but if I ever take my dog to a meeting I ask everyone involved if they're allergic and if they mind.  Honestly, many people ask where she is if I don't bring her.
2.  If you have coworkers who are allergic I think you try to work something out so it doesn't bother them.  If it still bothers them, I guess you'd have to leave the dog at home.  Everyone I know who has a dog is super respectful, and in turn people who are allergic try to work things out.
3.  No breed restrictions, but your dog needs to be quiet and able to hang out without being a nuisance.

The cops were called repeatedly but nothing happened. Eventually it took direct confrontation from a group of us guys to convince him that remaining where he was would be detrimental to his self and his property.

You can't blame too much on the actual police officers though; they don't make these policies. From what I could gather from the police, they were under orders to stay away from this crowd because the leadership at City Hall didn't want to be seen as ""harassing"" or otherwise interdicting homeless people and/or the mentally ill.

"Here's the rules as linked by /u/dump_cake .  Short answer is, you're mostly right, but signage dictates what the ped should do and doesn't give the driver right of way over the ped if they're violating the crossing control signals (signage).  There's also that issue with how the law, as written, requires that the ped be in the roadway (a step into the roadway demonstrating faith in drivers knowing the law) so there's a lot of people who are wary to take such a step and some drivers who won't yield even when there's an obvious gait towards the roadway.


&gt;RCW 46.61.235 Crosswalks.

&gt;(1) The operator of an approaching vehicle shall stop and remain stopped to allow a pedestrian or bicycle to cross the roadway within an unmarked or marked crosswalk when the pedestrian or bicycle is upon or within one lane of the half of the roadway upon which the vehicle is traveling or onto which it is turning. For purposes of this section ""half of the roadway"" means all traffic lanes carrying traffic in one direction of travel, and includes the entire width of a one-way roadway.

&gt;(2) No pedestrian or bicycle shall suddenly leave a curb or other place of safety and walk, run, or otherwise move into the path of a vehicle which is so close that it is impossible for the driver to stop.

&gt;(3) Subsection (1) of this section does not apply under the conditions stated in RCW 46.61.240(2).

"Mayor and the entire council decided its cool to give away 2 million, they have all the monies they need from sales tax right?

&gt; With all the attention the city budget got last month, no one seemed to notice the city council unanimously approved a corporate tax break worth a couple of million dollars last week.
Since 2007, the city has made companies that claim an exemption on the city’s gross receipts tax, pay a square footage tax—basically a tax on the size of their building, to make up the difference. At the mayor’s urging, the city scrapped the square footage tax last month.
Here’s the background: In 2007, the state legislature tweaked the way companies paid taxes, allowing them to pay less locally if part of their final transaction or business was done elsewhere. A complicated “apportionment” structure determined how much of a local break they got. Since that change, Seattle had been making companies that used the new rules to avoid a portion of gross receipt taxes, pay the separate square footage tax to make up the difference. While the city rules made sure companies weren’t paying more than they would have paid under the gross receipts tax, they ensured the city wasn’t losing any money from the apportionment exemption.
The city scrapped the tax, allowing companies to take the exemption without making up the difference.
Calling the money—about $2 million out of the $200 million B&amp;O tax base—“incidental,” both the mayor’s office, which pushed to repeal the square footage tax, and the council, which signed off on it with an 8-0 vote this month, the city scrapped the tax, allowing companies to take the exemption without making up the difference.

"There's a lot more to it than that. Like the domestic abuse allegations in his wife's upcoming Tedx talk:

&gt; ""Price’s life may get more complicated the week of Dec. 7, when TEDx plans to post online a public talk by his former wife, who changed her last name to Colón. She spoke on Oct. 28 at the University of Kentucky about the power of writing to overcome trauma. Colón stood on stage wearing cerulean blue and, without naming Price, read from a journal entry she says she wrote in May 2006 about her then-husband. “He got mad at me for ignoring him and grabbed me and shook me again,” she read. “He also threw me to the ground and got on top of me. He started punching me in the stomach and slapped me across the face. I was shaking so bad.” Later in the talk, Colón recalled once locking herself in a car, “afraid he was going to body-slam me into the ground again or waterboard me in our upstairs bathroom like he had done before.”

&gt; I read those quotes to Price. “I’m just going to take a second because this is very surprising to me,” he said. He paused. “I appreciate and respect my former wife, and she played a very positive role in my life,” he said. “Out of respect for her, I wouldn’t feel comfortable responding to a supposed allegation she may have said coming from a Bloomberg Businessweek reporter when I have absolutely zero evidence of an allegation being made.” I told him that I wanted to be clear: I was giving him the chance to deny the claims. “My comment is very responsive,” he said. “I would be more than happy to provide a comment if and when I actually get the benefit of seeing what you are referencing.”""",,,,TribalDancer,,,1449009961,t5_2qhad,t3_3v1uiv,t3_3v1uiv,18,1451378208,0,0,cxjok7u,Seattle,18,,

"If you're looking for easygoing places to visit and/or live, you will find many such neighborhoods in Seattle city limits. It is an easygoing city overall, with lots of neighborhoods that feel like their own small town. In fact, many of them feel like walkable suburbs, if such a thing were to exist.

Bellevue is a bona fide city in its own right, with a distinct neighborhood and a full fledged city center with mega-chain restaurants and parks and museums, higher median income, and less diversity than even milquetoast Seattle. The vibe downtown is more ""can I speak to your manager, these are $400 shoes and there's a puddle between here and my Tesla"" uppity than ""you do you"" easygoing. The residential areas are more relaxed, sure, but they're miles away from the nearest anything to do.

"As you said, it's a perfectly fair question to ask if the cops should have started shooting with the woman (or other civilians) so close by. I imagine SPD will take that into consideration when they review this incident, which would undoubtedly entail interviewing the cops as to the motivations behind why they started shooting when they did. 

These are questions that should be asked, as part of any investigation into the use of lethal force, especially in a residential area, and especially when bystanders are in the immediate vicinity.

"I just love how few facts are present.

Shootings are factually rare, getting more rare, and the majority affect poor minority communities (gang violence).

&gt;At Mother Jones, where I work as an editor, we have compiled an in-depth, open-source database covering more than three decades of public mass shootings. By our measure, there have been four “mass shootings” this year, including the one in San Bernardino, and at least 73 such attacks since 1982.


[The statistics now being highlighted in the news come primarily from shootingtracker.com, a website built by members of a Reddit forum supporting gun control called GunsAreCool. That site aggregates news stories about shooting incidents — of any kind — in which four or more people are reported to have been either injured or killed.](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/04/opinion/how-many-mass-shootings-are-there-really.html?_r=0)

"&gt;They could find out if anyone at the home is on parole or probation.

In Washington State, police need to have a DOC Officer with them to enforce probation or parole agreements. Regular police can't do it. This is why SPD sometimes does joint patrols with DOC.

&gt;They could also knock on the door, and if iPhone has the ability to ring via ""Find my iPhone"" then I willing to bet having the phone ring while the officer is at the door would justify probable cause.

But even if that worked (and the device is within earshot of the door), they'd still need to write a search warrant to enter the home and have it approved by a judge, a process which takes hours. In the meantime, what happens if the suspect (now alerted to police investigation) gets smart and destroys the phone inside the house? Poof, no evidence, no arrest.

And even if the phone is recovered, and suspects arrested, the law requires the prosecutors prove the suspect [KNEW](http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9A.56.140) it was stolen. If the suspect is even slightly smart and says nothing about how he got the phone, or says he bought it off Craigslist or something, the police cannot prove he knew it was stolen. So the case would be dropped if it ever got to court.

I agree the police in an ideal world should try to do something. But in OP's case, nobody is going to go to jail unless they are literally the world's dumbest phone thieves. So I can see why the police don't spend four hours investigating these cases.",,,,Elbabe,,,1449369668,t5_2qhad,t3_3vl1dn,t1_cxokfa0,19,1451465127,0,0,cxopb9q,Seattle,19,,
"The distance from the can has the work of a dedicated crow written all over it. 
Walking dogs on Capitol Hill I admit to stopping and watching and admiring their ability to hurl a carefully knotted up poop bag some distance from a trash can. 

I can't prove it, but have seen it enough times to question whether or not it is fun or that they are indeed in search of some vittles. It appears as I react and dog(s) they may increase the behavior. Never actually eating, just hurling poo bags. Taking turns in fact. I am not making this up - I swear crows are smart. In the least, the ones on Capitol Hill enjoy an audience and have a complete understanding of how a leash works in restraining a dog. 

Seagulls - I have never observed this behavior. They do nothing for fun that I have seen. If they go into the trash it is for food. Never to see how far poo will fly. Poo bags would be piled up at the base if moved at all if it was gulls.

Seriously, look at where some of these buildings that tolerate drug and alcohol use are and you are gonna find more overt signs of poverty than normal.  99% of the time the people at these ""troublesome"" bus stops or buildings are just hanging out but it is really not that surprising when some sort of actual crime happens around them.  And the monthly income you are talking about isn't necessarily coming from having a job.  Some of these people are getting disability checks which cover the rent they have to pay.  The ""incredibly strict requirements"" in place are true for a lot of low-income housing, but not all.  I am assuming that the strict requirements are on federally funded sites because so many people complained about the public housing bogeyman that is the ""welfare queen"".  The feds got scared about public perception, without thinking about reality, and fucking caved.  Lots of agencies, though, that have a more realistic view of things, and get funding from elsewhere, can make up their own regulations.

"When you think about this, consider what your $1600/month will buy

That's a mortgage of about $350,000.  at 3.92% (current rates) your payment would be $1655.  But your net payment, assuming you're in the 30% or so federal tax area, would be approximatelyl $1100, given that most of your payments early on would be interest.  

You could probably pay 30% more and have your net cost be about the same, so that puts you into the $415k price area.

for the 70 acre farm, 4 bedroom house, barns, 2 wells and an apple orchard and so on about an hour north of seattle, i paid $420k.  

I moved from capitol hill to here; here's some of the differences. 
  * can't walk to anywhere - car is pretty much required.  
  * take-out food is limited compared to seattle
  * heroin addicts don't throw bricks through the window in my front door
  * I don't have to lock every single thing down to prevent theft
  * in two years my car hasn't been prowled once

"I finally became a hat-wearer last year, and just upgraded to a much higher quality, better-fitting--and more expensive--winter hat. But, despite being a hat-wearer, I'm not at all surprised that everyone else around here sticks to beanies, or wearing hoodies, or going bare-headed, because hats can seem like more trouble than they're worth. 

Beanies are cheap, available everywhere, fit just about any head, and don't blow off in the wind. If you leave yours on the bus, it's no big loss. A decent hat, however, is a lot harder to find, is much more expensive, and if you lose it, it costs more time and effort to replace. If you've never been a hat-wearer, it takes some getting used to, especially on windy days--learning to anticipate the next gust and tilt your head just so is an acquired skill. A hat also needs to be stored carefully when you're not wearing it so it doesn't get bent out of shape, unlike a beanie, which can be crammed in your pocket. 

Hats require a commitment. They require attention from the wearer. The great majority of people don't want to deal with that, so they don't wear hats. It's not a mystery. ",,,,Lawn_Killer,U District,,1449046421,t5_2qhad,t3_3v3yke,t3_3v3yke,19,1451387376,0,0,cxk7kj1,Seattle,19,,flair

"So this is fairly complicated from my understanding.

Firstly, I didn't have my serial number, which is my fault, so the pawn shop couldn't look it up by that.  By law, they can't purchase items that have serial numbers without entering them into this database system thing.

So even if they looked the bike up by serial, the police report/system didn't have my serial, so there would never have been a match.  Additionally, they took the bike in on Saturday and I didn't report it until Monday (when I first noticed it stolen).  So even if I had had the serial number, they would have looked the bike up before the database had a record of my serial.

Then there are laws about how long they have to hold the items, etc.

For my bike, they paid $200 for it, and were required by law to keep a copy of an ID of the person pawning it.  The police have all that info.  The pawn shop lost out on the $200 they paid out.  Fair market value is over $2000 for this bike.  They know the risks associated and make the gamble that police will never come looking.

I'm not sure why North Seattle residents expect the government to build their sidewalks when property owners and developers built their own across the rest of the city.

"Work From Home.

Seriously, it beats most days in the office.  More gets done, with less overhead, no rushing around to get out and commute.  No pants if you don't want.   

Done it this way for 5 years now, would never go back to office required job without serious bump in pay.

Managers In Town:  If you have any kind of knowledge worker, let them work from home.  Set expectations, expect weekly project updates, equip them with conferencing software and cover their phone and data line expense.

The result is productivity.  

The only thing holding this back is the idiotic old idea that people cannot accomplish stuff unless they're face to face bickering back and forth in a conference room. 

Rewarding yourselves for getting appropriately dressed and showing up on time seems strange, and I have to laugh at the idea that your precious office culture and hallway discussions are somehow worth putting employees through 2-4 hours a day of commute hell.

Anyway, in 20 years we'll all be doing it, you can thank me then.  Keep the $50 mil.  Buy some kids tablets and some ebook licenses, because they'll be doing it too some day soon if not already.

tl;dr: Any knowledge worker can work from home at least half of the work week, I've seen it be successful and we need more of it.  Cut down on people needing to put time into commuting.

&gt;In 2010, detectives from SPD's Gang Unit ordered two Latino men suspected of committing a crime to lie on the ground, where they were kicked and verbally assaulted; the incident was captured on a bystander's cellphone video.[19][20] The police let the men go soon afterwards; the video prompted protests over racial tensions and a police department internal investigation. **Several officers were suspended without pay and/or demoted, but not criminally charged**

Then you're faced with merging traffic coming off of a left hand merge, a slight curve, and with signage that indicates exit only for three lanes.  As a driver trying to get through this who may not drive it frequently and recognize the patterns, I'd say its only natural to slow -- which then creates a ripple back for miles.

"&gt; Shouldn't my extra $100-$125 electric vehicle road repair tax cover that (tabs were over $300)?

Yes! The state's argument is that as more vehicles become electric, they won't pay a share of road maintenance through gas taxes.  However they usually fail to mention that the difference is under $200/year.  An amount nearly made up for by the electric vehicle tax.

"You made several comments in the thread about the difference that $500 would make (student loans, etc), and how to make that up by reducing costs.

But you may be thinking about this as an expense problem, not an income problem. The reason I say that is that income has the potential to increase over time *faster than expenses increase*.

So instead of trying to save a few hundred a month in expenses (which, to be honest, you're unlikely to do by moving in such a competitive housing market), consider instead increasing your income by $500/mo. That's a net increase of $20/day. Can you ask for a $2/hr raise at work? Can you pick up an odd job at night, or on the weekends? Can you change jobs, given that there are many people hiring these days?

The nice thing about income is that it starts to scale exponentially, especially when you continue to invest in yourself and aren't ashamed of actively trying to earn more (which a LOT of people are ashamed of, so not being so gives you a competitive advantage).

The difference between the well-off (those not worrying about student loans and a few hundred extra a month in rent) and the vast majority of everyone else is almost always that the well-off have more income. But many, if not most, of those people started out just like you (or me) and scraped by at the beginning. But year over year, they found a way to increase their income, and they probably started down that path early on.

I hope this different perspective doesn't offend you, or anyone else. Best of luck on your search. (And if you do end up in the far-flung suburbs, don't listen to the haters. Peace and quiet and nature are wonderful and underappreciated things. Embrace the country life and enjoy!)

"I used to work for a tiny 6 person construction company that did mostly apartment remodels in Seattle. That fine would have been laughable to us and just a cost of doing business. But a permit to close down like 8 squares of a sidewalk (on 11th in Capitol Hill) so a guy could get up on a scissor lift and install windows or something like that was a couple of grand a day. 

Why isn't a $30,060,000 a year city of Seattle government operation working for the greater good of the citizens? A lane on a major arterial through downtown or SLU shouldn't be fucking closed at 8am on a weekday. A sidewalk downtown ought to be walkable during any hours it is normally jam packed with people in a city that prides itself on density and our walkable neighborhood scores. A drunk shouldn't have to stumble through potholed streets at 2am as he staggers out of a bar on the hill or Belltown at 2am on a Saturday morning. 

Why throw $30m/year at a team of city inspectors with iPads who can put a squeeze on an offensive developer after a week of fucking us over? It isn't some crazy pipe dream that the people of Seattle could actually get decent use out of what already lacking infrastructure is right in front of us. Put that money towards having irritating construction work done in between rush hours, in the evening, at nights, on weekends; really whenever it is being least utilized in the normal daily lives of the people of Seattle.

"&gt; The reality on Metro transit today kind-of sucks and my personal belief that the current clowns can fix it is somewhere between slim and none.

Well, to be pedantic, the ""current clowns"" aren't the one proposing and funding this, Seattle DOT is.  It will likely contract with Metro to run the buses--like how SDOT contracts with Metro to run additional buses on some Metro routes today--but SDOT will be responsible for the end-to-end implementation.

Though I also give the ""current clowns,"" meaning Metro's planners, a lot of credit for getting *anything* done in this climate.  Metro stands alone as being the only transit agency in Western Washington that functions as a department of a county government.  All other agencies--including Sound, Community, Kitsap, Pierce, and Island Transits--are their own agencies with their own boards and their own taxing authorities.  Metro is run by a political body (the Metropolitan King County Council) and has its budget as part of the overall county budget.

Why does this matter?  It means that directly-elected political officials are subject to lobbying by special interest groups to keep routes the exact same as they have always been in perpetuity.  The Council also has political realities that are separate from transit, like parking, land use, tax rates for the rural side of the county (witness the results of the countywide Metro Prop 1), and so on.

Ever wondered why Metro Route 2 stays *exactly* where it is even though the congestion points are well known and alternate routes are logistically easy to implement?  There's a well-organized group that wants 2 to stay exactly where it is to provide direct, front-door access to Virginia Mason.

Ever wondered why the D line takes a jog through Queen Anne instead of going straight downtown?  Same deal, a well-organized group lobbied to get a ""RapidRide / express / high-capacity"" route watered down to do local service in their area.

Ever wondered why most West Seattle routes go where they do and sit in traffic the whole time?  Well-organized groups get offended at the loss of any off-street parking so they balk at bus-only lanes.  (Bonus note of this: Southbound Aurora Ave bus lane just before the bridge.  That lane is morning rush-hour only.  The northbound lane is morning *and* evening rush-hour.  An influential land owner pitched a holy fit and even went so far as to **make his own signs** that contradicted the ones Metro and SDOT installed and stated that the lanes are AM peak only.  Metro and SDOT got tired of fighting him for over two years and gave up so he got his parking spaces back between 3pm and 7pm.)

An addendum, to make my point clearer: Why does it matter that bodies like Community Transit are their own entities (""Public Transit Benefit Areas,"" or a ""Regional Transit Authority"" in Sound Transit's case)?  Because they have their own priorities that stand separate from the general political priorities of the county government.  Yes, they're still subject to the cities and counties doing the infrastructure and road work changes they need but they can function as their own ""special interest group"" when it comes to lobbying for those to be done.  That's versus getting lost in the shuffle like Metro so often does when people pick up the phone or the pen and complain directly to their County Councilmember.  

By the way, general transit riders like you and I don't talk to our Councilmembers at the same ""volume"" as other groups.  Ever wonder why we seem to get left out?

That would seriously discourage people from outlying areas to use public transit and here is why.  When you are using Sound Transit (bus or rail) - you do NOT live in Seattle.  The system ""serves"" Seattle only in the sense it primarily shuttles white collar, M-F office workers from places such as Lakewood, Tacoma and Everett.  Therefore, you already have 60+ minutes invested in a commute to Seattle.

Having to take transit TO the park and ride would undoubtedly add up to 30-45 minutes to an already long commute.

"I rode the bus for 6 months before I started driving. Yes, getting a parking spot is very difficult. Also, no buses go to SLU. Often, I'd have to park at the grocery store, take a bus to the park and ride, a bus to seattle, and then walk almost a mile to work. On the way home, buses were overcrowded, full, late, sometimes you'd have to watch more than one go by.

If you could afford it, and it meant getting home earlier before your kids go to bed, wouldn't you drive too? You can make driving cost more, but that isn't going to help the situation. We need more buses, a few different routes, and more parking spots at the park and ride. My employer pays for the bus, yet I pay hundreds in parking and gas to drive...

The annoying thing is the park and ride I'd go to, if you looked at it on google maps, had a huge field next to it. However, that field is now an apartment complex. It seems to me they could have made the parking lots twice as big if they wanted to, but they didn't.

"I don't think that article is really about following Portland, it is more about what the city can do to encourage more home owners to invest in a DADU on their property -- and the article used some of Portland's incentives as examples.

I own a lot in north Seattle that is large enough to build a DADU, and I've considered doing this -- but I'd like to see some of the regulations modified before I invest the $ to build one.

I'm actually okay with the off street parking requirement, but we should alter the height limit so that people can devote the 1st floor of a new structure to parking, and that parking space should not count against the 800 SF living space for the DADU.

The $10K sewer hookup fee is outrageous, and the city should do more to negotiate that with the county. A 700 square foot DADU with a single bathroom does not have the same sewer impact as a new 4,000 SF house with 3.5 bathrooms and 5 bedrooms -- so the sewer hookup fee should reflect that.

Also, some of the setbacks should be modified. It is fine to keep required setback to neighbor's lots, but the setback to a public street or alley could be smaller -- with no impact to the neighborhood and city quality of life. The current setback to the street is 10' -- 5' would make more sense for some situations and works fine in other cities.

Also, the city should hire a specific person at the DPD office who specializes in helping people get their DADU plans permitted at the lowest cost possible. Too often the DPD acts like a bureaucracy designed for the experts (developers) that know how to navigate it -- do more to help the grass roots developers -- home owners.

Found an interesting DPD publication with some suggestions that DPD is considering for changes to the DADU program -- http://www.seattle.gov/dpd/cs/groups/pan/@pan/documents/web_informational/s010013.pdf

Also, The $10K sewer hookup cost seems to be an example of less than clear reporting on the part of the Seattle Times. Looks like this is not an upfront cost paid at development and hookup time, but is paid over 15 years as an additional sewer fee -- which is about $59/mo. Here is a link to the king county site that explains this http://www.kingcounty.gov/services/environment/wastewater/capacity-charge.aspx

I do still think that fee should be modified for a DADU, compared to a new 4,000 SF house with 3.5 bathrooms, but at least it isn't a $10K upfront fee as the Times article implied.",,,,boi88,,,1450639223,t5_2qhad,t3_3xlly6,t3_3xlly6,72,1451758961,0,0,cy5q2ot,Seattle,72,,

I ended up canceling the service within the first month and went with Comcast. My monthly bill is $60 dollars vs the $114 for CL. The service is their internet-only ~120Mbps down. No connectivity issues in the past month.

"&gt; &gt; reduced class size

&gt; Less responsibility

Wrong, it's proven that kids learn better in smaller classes. Teachers teach more effectively when their attention isn't being split 40 different ways, kids' attention is more focused with fewer distractions, personalized attention can be given to kids who need it. This isn't rocket science.

&gt;&gt; more recess

&gt; More free time

Right, but not in the way you meant it. Teachers need breaks and time to prep. Also, I read somewhere that exercise is good for kids. Will wonders never cease?

&gt; &gt; Keep (raising) salaries high

&gt; More money.

Right, because teaching is a way to get rich. Let's see you get by in Seattle on a 36k starting salary, when you've not only got to pay for your own necessities, but for your classroom supplies (which budgets don't cover in any meaningful way), your student loans (because you went to college for at least six years, possibly more, because you wanted to be a teacher and help educate kids), and your additional training (which WA state law mandates you take in your own time and at your own expense), without having to take a second job.

&gt; We need to weed out the bad kids who have no interest in learning and only disrupt classes and get them into manual labor.

One big problem is that, while much of the Downtown portion can be easily lidded, the portion north of the Convention Center, where the west side of the freeway is actually *below* the freeway, cannot be so easily or cheaply lidded.

Even if they only go to Olive, that's only about 1000 feet of I-5 between the current lid and Olive. The proposed cost would be a substantial investment to lid such a small portion of the highway.

Also, what's proposed vastly overestimates what could be built on the lid. Most structures aren't feasible projects to build on top of a concrete lid. Every structure built over a lid was actually based on solid ground, and at best merely draped non-foundational portions of the structure over the lid itself. You can't actually build foundations for towers directly on a concrete lid, because the foundation is not etched into the ground.

If you want to convince people that you're actually good at what you do, you really need to reign in those clowns. I propose -  The Washington State Fair Tolling Act- to help you.

1) make it law that a person must be able to pay their bill online, with a single sign in, regardless of pay by mail, or auto toll, with minimum clicks after sign on. 
     The idea that the two sides don't interact and cant be paid for by simple web interfaces shouts - I'm in it to gouge you at every possible opportunity. 

2) make it law that the private company managing the state tolling system must have their WA customer Service Centers based in WA, and employ Washingtonians. 

3) Make it law that the management of the tolling system cannot charge more than 15% of tolls collected on a monthly basis. And the rest should go to road system improvement &amp; light rail, high speed rail implementation. 

4) that unpaid tolling fees cannot exceed 5%, ever. And there should be an option to pay tolls at the time you buy new plate tabs. 

5) the tolling system cannot interfere with lawful registration of your vehicle until they are 24 months overdue. At which point you could opt to pay the tolls plus 5% and register your vehicle.

The idea that you allow Good-to-go to soil your good name (WA State Dept of Transportation) with things like 1000% fees on missed tolls, astonishes me. Especially when you or ""good-to-go"" cant even pull off credit card billing, and your CSRs are powerless, as well as have Co-opted judges that make summary judgements based on uncertified mail. No one else could get away with what you get away with. 

I'm interested in a rebuttal - either for spite purposes, or even educational purposes- but face it, Good-to-Go is designed to gouge people at every opportunity and preys on the indifferences of the more well off, and the inability of the less well off.

"Uggh,  How can this possibly be a good thing?

I've been covered by group health since about 1970 (low 6 digit consumer number) and have been paying out of pocket for an individual policy for my family with them for the last 8 years.

It has had its ups and downs for sure and hasn't always been a smooth ride.  Overall though I am presently satisfied with them, more or less, but I am extremely skeptical anything positive will come of this for consumers/patients.

I expect it will exacerbate the negative trend I've experienced:

* Payment processing incompetence.  Changing the payment vendor/website around every few years has been a complete cock-up of errors.  Case in point my current premium auto-pay shows two transactions, one failed and one pending, for a week now, and all they tell me is to check again on Monday to see if it has gone through.  By that point it will be past due, but they literally have no idea of what is happening or why my payment is stuck right now.

* Nearly impossible to get any reasonably accurate cost information before a service is rendered.  Then finding that your kid's condition is too obscure to be diagnosed at Group Health and they punt you over to Children's.

* Every year without fail getting a letter saying ""your plan has been discontinued!  but great news, here are the new plans which erode your past coverage while jacking the rates and increasing deductibles.""  I guess that's par for the course in the industry, but it always feels slimy/underhanded in the way the message is delivered.  I would like for once, just once, to have the same plan for more than 12 months.

* Here's your dental plan that you are required to put your kids on.  Oh but ""to serve you better"" we are going to switch to a different plan administrator every few years, each with a different network of dentists, requiring you to either eat huge costs or switch dentists.

* Oh you need durable medical equipment?  Let's refer you over to Apria Healthcare for that, where you will pay 4x the price an item is available for online.  No we won't give you a copy of your prescription so you can buy it online.

"Things like this are very, very popular in other parts of the country -- the NYC metro area has a literal fuck tons of them for the various train lines that stream into the city, and I think so did Boston and London. 

For whatever reason, locals here have opposed building strong network of them, and now there's massive opposition by activists from the belief (likely justified) that it would facilitate and make it easier for people to live further out in far flung places like a Maple Valley.... which then over time leads to more growth in places like that. They could become sprawl incubators. 

It's a tricky problem. The general accepted thing I've heard that is better is to just require ""downtown type"" development and high rise residential for like 1/4 mile in all directions around each train station. That fixes a ton of problems, concentrates growth, etc.

The older population is too apathetic to do anything about it and it is a serious problem for the younger people who have no stimulus (economically or entertaining).

"Wow.  Lots of Bellevue hate here. 

I spent 30 years living in Seattle, last 20 in Bellevue.  In Seattle, grew up in the CD and went to Franklin HS, and then lived in Leschi, U-District, Laurelhurst, Licton Springs, Roosevelt (in a Hugh Sisley house no less) West Seattle and Magnolia.  Seattle has better neighborhoods with lots of different feels.  The diversity is amazing, fun, and interesting.  Cool to explore and you can always find place that will take you as you come.  On the other hand, Seattle feels disfunctional in odd ways -  some basic things just don't seem to happen well.  Traffic has become gridlock, streets are full of potholes, parks can't get mowed, the city counsel operates like an ongoing soap opera, schools vary widely, homelessness is rampant....

Bellevue feels much like the flipside of this.  Basic stuff seems to happen well here but there's a distinct lack of the neighborhood feeling and urban centers you get in Seattle.  Much of this seems tied to the urban planning premise that was so widely accepted when Bellevue was built - bedroom communities and commute to business and industrial centers.  My neighborhood in Bellevue is clean, quiet and mostly crime free.  I have lots of awesome parks and sportfields nearby.  My kids go to newly built schools.  I don't worry too much if I forget to lock my doors...... 

They both have their points...just depends what you're looking for.

FWIW - I live near Lake Sammamish in South Bellevue and never go to downtown Bellevue.   If you go downtown, yes...your only impression well be that it's expensive and plastic.  But remember those people there come from everywhere - Seattle, Bellevue, Issaquah, Redmond, Kirkland...you name it.

Honestly I have no problem with what Amazon has done to SLU. It revitalized a bad neighborhood into a business center and expanded the downtown district plus added thousands of jobs to the city (yes some people are not locals but they are attracting talent to the city) and made Seattle one of the country's fastest growing and progressive cities. Yeah it sucks that there is not a lot of affordable housing downtown but what strong US cities is there affordable housing in the middle of the city? Seattle is still relatively affordable compared to other cities such as SF and NYC plus a lot of the bigger companies are compensating for the higher cost of living prices by increasing pay. I thin the continued expansion of the light rail so it can service more of the city to allow easier access to downtown to allow easy commute into the city to more evenly disburse people and level out rent costs for both in and out of the city.,,,,dawgtilidie,,,1450316417,t5_2qhad,t3_3x40x4,t3_3x40x4,17,1451690036,0,0,cy1qhzv,Seattle,17,,

"Let's define ""homicide"":

&gt;the deliberate and unlawful killing of one person by another; murder.

&gt;&gt;•Homicides from Rifles &amp; Handguns:  **6,543**  
&gt;&gt;•Homicides from “personal weapons” (fists, feet, etc): **728**

"**Of course Uber doesn't want their employees to have any bargaining power. This is the entire basis of their business model: at-will, disposable employees which bear all of the risk and liability of the business.**

Last year, Uber announced it got more money from venture capitalists than any other company, putting its value at around $40 billion - higher than American Airlines.

Yet Uber employs roughly only 1,500 people directly. The rest of its “employees” – the drivers who use their own cars - take on almost all the cost and risk. In fact , Uber demands drivers handle any and all damage claims themselves through their own personal car insurance, even though those insurance companies don’t cover commercial activity. [These](http://robertreich.org/post/109894095095), drivers use their own cars, take out their own insurance, work as many hours as they want or can – and pay Uber a fat percent. 

Worker safety? Social Security? Uber says it’s not the employer so it’s not responsible. Uber drivers aren’t insured to drive others for money. Which means Uber riders won't collect if there's an accident.

Defenders of on-demand work emphasize its flexibility. However, unpredictable work hours increase stress. According to polls, almost a quarter of American workers worry they won’t be earning enough in the future. That’s up from 15 percent a decade ago. Irregular hours can also take a mental toll. Studies show people who do irregular work for a decade suffer an average cognitive decline of 6.5 years relative people with regular hours.

Defenders of ""on-demand work"" point out that as on-demand work continues to grow, on-demand workers are joining together in guild-like groups to buy insurance and other benefits.

But, notably, they aren’t using their bargaining power to get a larger share of the income they pull in, or steadier hours. **That would be a union – something that Uber, Amazon, and other on-demand companies don’t want.**

Disposable labor and poor returns to employees are a great business model for mega-companies in the new economy. It just isn't a great model of stability, work and income for the millions of Americans with little to no other choice.

"I think it's a mixed bag.  I have some friends who bought in Georgetown recently.  Evidently, before Boeing ceded the airfield to the port authority, they offered everyone in the neighborhood a deal whereby they would pay for triple pane windows, but you somehow agreed to not sue Boeing for the noise as a result.  I dunno how they did this...waiver or whatever.  Anyhoo, fast forward to now, my friends live in a house on Ellis Ave. S which they bought from somebody who took the deal.  Yeah, they've got triple pane windows, but they're subject to a deal somebody else got paid off for.  Changing the bad guy from the state to one of our favorite Evil Corporations(tm) makes it easier to see the homeowner's side of the equation a bit more sympathetically, I think.

"1.  Victoria is a city of more than 350,000 people and it is situated on Vancouver Island.

"It's actually pretty simple.  Instead of taxing everything at a certain percentage like sales tax, meaning the total tax revenue depends on the market and can be unpredictable, property taxes take in an exact, specified amount of money each year.

So, the assessor simply divides up that total tax sum and divides it to each property weighted by its value.   That is why your home value increasing does not equate to a property tax increase, as long as all your neighbors houses are increasing in value at the same rate.

It is actually a very smart way to collect taxes.

Its gotten too much press actually. The suggestion of a racist foul play narrative came from a single tweet, and everyone including local blog and the family has run with it.

Aside from pulling a NSA and dragging in a twitter user for questioning, the police have stated multiple times they have no evidence this was anything other than an accident/suicide.

The dragon wants it, and will dance through many city blocks to get it.  Here it is on Fifth Avenue, with its tail still crossing Pine Street.  This is a long way from the International District where the great dragon is released on Chinese New Year to dance amid fireworks and the persistent beat of drums and cymbals through the streets south of Jackson.

In context, Chipotle has already had 2 national outbreaks of e coli.  Now here's an inspector with a decision to make, do I allow Chipotle the benefit of the doubt, or do I do my actual job and enforce the laws the way the laws are written.

Consider as well if he/she does give Chipotle a break, and overlooks the 5 degree temp issue ... Chipotle could very well have another national incident and this inspector would wind up being fired or reprimanded, certainly would look incompetent, for knowing something was wrong but being too lenient.

There's times as an inspector one can be lenient, and there's other times when one absolutely cannot.

"Reposting this form r/dogs to give people another example.

I purchased a dog from Andrew in spring of 2013 1/2 boerboel, 1/4 kangal, 1/4 dogo we named him Bagheera. I told Andrew I would be keeping the dog with me at the gym I was the head coach for and he would be around kids and other dogs regularly, Andrew told me it would be good advertising for him.
When Bagheera was 6 months old a friend of ours liked him enough to buy his half brother from a litter just a couple months younger. That dog was named Hooch he was 1/2 kangal 1/4 boerboel 1/4 dogo. We met another dog from the same breeder named Mouse at the dog park she was 1/2 boerboel, 1/4 kangal 1/4 dane, and we all started meeting up with our dogs. All have since had to be put to sleep. All because of aggression. Mouse passed away to today
At 9 months Bagheera became so aggresive with other male dogs he could not be taken to dog parks or walked off leash, at 105 lbs of very muscular dog my wife could no longer walk him at all. At almost two years old he bit a friend of ours, then snapped at our daughter three weeks later, we consulted 3 behaviorists who all told us based on his history and behavior there was was no safe way to keep him or rehome him we had him put to sleep. Additionally Bagheera had demodex and recurrent Knee sprains.
At the same time Hooch had also become uncontrollable with other male dogs and a couple of weeks before Bagheera bit, Hooch bit his owners roomates 6 year old son, Hoochs owner worked with a behaviorist until even after we put Bagheera down but a few days after Bagheera went down Hooch went after two girls who were personal training clients of his owners for no apparent reason. He was put to sleep. Hooch also had weird coat problems.
Mouse, was actually the earliest to have issues she became extremely aggressive to small dogs at 6 months old, but she never became people aggresive, however she ended up having to be put to sleep today because she almost killed her owners other dog, a dog the owner had adopted from a friend because it was the only dog who Mouse was still comfortable around. Mouse also tore her ACL at 18 months.
I have also been told of at least 3 more dogs from this breeder who were likely put to sleep because of aggression through friends in the breeding and rescue networks.

I am not here to defend my decision it was a mistake I am not interested in debating what types of dogs are appropriate for who just want people to know that allot of these dogs are being sold in the seattle area and they are dangerous.

"If you're curious as to why it's because we're transitioning into a drier, much more stable air mass (notice how the clouds in the photo are stratiform, meaning they form in horizontal 'layers' as opposed to vertical convective motion). The jet stream is bringing NW winds aloft which, in general, tends to create subsidence (sinking air) which improves stability and discourages convective activity. There's still enough moisture in the air to condense in the form of clouds in this photo but that will change in the coming days as the air dries out with clear skies prevailing towards the end of the week. This dry, stable pattern will provide some really nice views of the mountains through the weekend. The reason it looks different than other clear days (like in the summer) is that the stability, density and temperature of the air all affect how light is refracted through it, same reason the moon can look much bigger on some nights than others.",,,,wx_bombadil,,,1451451862,t5_2qhad,t3_3yppcw,t1_cyfiax5,59,1451933807,0,0,cyfu1ly,Seattle,59,,

"&gt;I noticed there are some signs that say you need to tap your orca card before and after you ride. What is the purpose of that? Do you get a smaller fare if your ride is shorter? Is there a certain time frame you have for your second scan before it charges you for another fare?

Yes. You have the duration of a normal transfer to tap out before it defaults to the largest fare (it doesn't charge you another one, it just assumes you traveled the longest distance possible and thus charges you the highest fare). With that said if you're going to the last stop you don't *need* to tap out since it'll be the highest fare anyway. Usually the fare difference isn't that much anyway, maybe 50 cents or so, so forgetting to tap out isn't the end of the world.

&gt;Also, how is the fare enforced? I've seen a few 'Fare Enforcement' officers around but what do they do? Do they just randomly pick people and scan their orca card to see if they paid the fare? It would seem incredibly easy to just ride for free.

Fare is enforced that way, similar to many other ""proof of purchase"" systems in the world. They don't just check random people so much, but they'll get on the train and walk the length of it checking everybody's pass. You can usually get away with a warning if they catch you without a fare the first time, but you'll get fined after that, and eventually banned from the system if you keep it up. It's possible to avoid paying the fare, but you need to pay attention every stop and make sure to jump off if you see the checkers getting on, sometimes they post up at stations too (like the bottom of the elevator at Beacon Hill) to check tickets before you're actually on the train. 

Not worth it to save a few dollars, in my opinion. Plus the fare is the service charge for using the system, your contribution helps Sound Transit to continue operating.",,,,macroclimate,,,1451211800,t5_2qhad,t3_3ydwx6,t3_3ydwx6,31,1451878401,0,0,cycn12a,Seattle,31,,

"You can hide/outrun someone with both. It's highly dependent on the situation you're presented with.

**MORE IMPORTANTLY**, the weapon changes the way the perpetrator commits the act. Someone with a knife isn't going to run up screaming at you with the knife raised like some cheesy 1960's slasher. They're going to keep it in their pocket til they're 3 inches from your back and then stab you as many times as they can before you either die or someone pulls them off. A knife is an extremely personal and compromising weapon for both the victim and criminal.

A person with a gun may also get close, but generally speaking people with guns use guns to get away quickly after they pop off some rounds in the general direction and in a hurried manner. Unless they're highly trained - they're not likely to hit anything they aim for.

This isn't an argument for less gun control - I'm just pointing out it's idiotic to meaningfully contrast the two weapons. They're used VERY differently in different situations and with dissimilar outcomes.

That being said - what the guy said above is correct. You're much more likely to die of an assault with a knife than you are with a gun. You may have a point that running from a knife is easier than dodging a bullet, but you're not likely to encounter the same closing distance with both weapons; so your statement is kind of meaningless here.",,,,WhatsThatNoize,Delridge,,1451336438,t5_2qhad,t3_3yjux0,t1_cye5hsm,10,1451905002,0,0,cye6eyd,Seattle,10,,flair

"I don't think people living in Federal Way would consider themselves as 'living in Seattle' - it's a far out suburb actually closer to Tacoma than Seattle.  

That said, if you're working at Sea Tac you do have the option of living on the light rail line to commute to work.  Most of the rail line runs through what used to be 'the hood' so it's lower rent than average. Another option is living in Burien or along the 509 corridor to the west.  That would give you a fairly easy commute and avoid I-5 altogether.  Federal Way is cheaper than average, but there are a lot of other areas that are just as inexpensive.  There's really no reason to pick Federal Way over any of the other south end towns, there's nothing special about it at all.  In fact it may be one of the more boring spots to live that still has a decent amount of crime.

- The protest was attended by lots of genuine people holding signs that said ""Fags against Nazis"" and ""No Racism, No Fascism"" etc. These people marched and chanted, and they weren't in any one place to cause much of a hold up so the Komo spin ""Block traffic"" is better said as ""made the 4 cars that were actually on the road wait for maybe 5 minutes longer unless they turned around"" 

- Several people, mostly dudes, dressed in all black with handkerchiefs covering the lower part of their faces hung around the outskirts of the main protest body, they didn't chant, they didn't have signs - the bar tender said she thought they were probably the ""anarchist kids who show up at any protest just because it might get exciting""

The details of the incidents published in these articles come from plaintiffs and plaintiff's attorneys.

"As someone that lives in an aPodment, I'll chime in.

I picked it because it had a short lease, 3 months, and moved to month to month after that.  It was fully furnished, including having pots and pans in the kitchen, and provided all utilities.

There aren't many negatives for me.  I'm married (wife is still in Italy) so I don't have people over.  If I were single, I can tell you, young ladies would not be interested in using the bathroom in these, there is zero privacy.

I never hear any of my neighbors.

Now for the negatives.

Their internet is highly filtered/blocked.  Steam doesn't work, Google Drive doesn't work, Skype works sometimes, SSH doesn't work, the list goes on and on.  VPN's using UDP don't work.  When I asked about this, the response was ""we aren't opening ports so you can torrent stuff.""  I never even mentioned torrents.  I tried discussing it with them, but they refused to have an intelligent conversation.  They blamed the issues on my computer.  I found that odd, since if I used  TCP VPN, I have no issues.  My phone, PC and MacBook all have connection issues, but only in the aPodment.

Secondly.  Security is a joke.  I had a high-end mountain bike stolen from the back storage area.  It's covered by a HD video camera and the walkway to get back there has two cameras on it.

It took them about 3 weeks to get me a copy of the video.  The aPodment employee sent me a [cellphone recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-Ol-MpDBnM) of a 15"" LCD displaying all 4 videos on a split screen.  It's worse than a potato phone video.  When I asked for a copy of the HD video from the DVR, the guy basically told me to go pound sand.

"Because the franchise agreement is about cable tv and customer service; **internet service is not part of the agreement** and the city cannot make any demands on internet or Comcast's prices in general as part of the agreement. [Source](http://www.seattle.gov/cable/franchiserenewal.htm). The agreement is about what companies have to do to make use of the public rights of way, like cables on telephone poles. It's not really about competition since any company will need some agreement with the city to use them. And [the City Council eliminated cable franchise districts earlier this year](http://www.geekwire.com/2015/seattle-city-council-approves-legislation-that-eliminates-cable-tv-franchise-districts/) allowing for more incremental competition by not requiring servicing an entire area, which could be prohibitively expensive especially for new companies (although that might also only apply to tv and not internet - I couldn't quite tell - nor could I tell how tied together the two are). In fact, there is explicit provision that the city can provide additional access to other companies.

&gt; 20.6 Other Cable Franchises.

&gt; The City shall not be limited or prevented by any provision in this Franchise from issuing any
&gt; franchise, permit, license, or other agreement of any kind for all of Grantee's Franchise Area or
&gt; any portion thereof, to other Cable Operators

I suspect it would actually be harmful to not renew the franchise agreement since the agreement includes Comcast paying the city, providing service to schools, supporting public, education, and government channels, quality of service and content requirements, and providing low-income discounts on all services (which [Murray wants Comcast to improve](http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/seattle-to-comcast-we-want-a-deal-like-philly-got/)). If it's not renewed, those benefits could go away, and if Comcast cannot use the ROW I expect their service would either disappear entirely or become dramatically more expensive as they find and finance other ways to get their service to customers. Unless they are allowed to continue using what they already have and the requirements only apply to expansion - I couldn't find any documentation on that. [The actual agreement documents](http://seattle.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=2502961&amp;GUID=0CE476B7-B157-4D82-83B2-5C708EBCDA0B&amp;Options=Advanced&amp;Search=) look pretty reasonable to me - or at least I haven't found truly objectionable parts yet.

But on the topic of internet, I'm so upset with the current situation. It's my understanding CL's gigabit is well over $100/mo because of bundling and ~$150/mo standalone. Comcast's 100+ Mbps service is over $100/mo, and they're supposed to start offering 2Gbps for $300/mo. Those prices are absurd even without the possibility of ""data plans"" and before the ~$30 rate hike to preserve current service. And then the City Council [recently voted down a $5million municipal fiber pilot program](https://nextcity.org/daily/entry/no-vote-isnt-stopping-push-for-municipal-broadband-in-seattle). The more reasonable options like CondoInternet are not yet available in enough areas and the city just can't seem to figure how to use its extensive dark fiber.

"Here is the email I sent them....

Dear G2G at WSDOT,
Today I was lucky enough to be contacted by you (email attached below) to inform me of my negative account balance. Confused, I logged onto the GoodToGo website and found that in fact my account had a negative balance. This confused me even more as I have a credit card, in good standing, connected to my GoodToGo account that should add $30 to my account if it drops below $8. It seems your system failed-again- to auto replenish my account. Being a good tax paying citizen I attempted to manually pay but was met with a warning on your site that: due to me having a negative balance I needed to call GoodToGo. 
Let me digress a bit here, and ask a simple question.... What year is this? Are you telling me that you can not build a site that allows me to pay a bill EVEN if I have a negative balance.?.?.? That is some very purposeful code you got there....
Anyways.... I called the number provided and after navigating the phone-tree was finally on hold for a representative. There I sat for 41 minutes, waiting for my representative. 

Let me say that one more time for clarity.... 41 minutes on hold!
There I got to listen to the pre-recorded message about how I could go to GoodToGo's website to pay a toll or update my account. Very ironic that I am unable to do just that....

Once my call was answered the rep quickly explained the situation about a software update that ""broke auto replenish"". (That was some darn good code testing there) After another 4 minutes of me verifying my identity I was able to end the call having payed you $30. 
That was 45 minutes of my life you wasted. I hate having my time wasted because of failures and the incompetence of other people, especially when those people are ""public servants"" who work for my government. This was a grand illustration of such failures. 
The 520 bridge is approximately 1.5 miles (7,578 feet or 1.43 miles) and at highway speed should take 90 seconds to cross. (Highway speed is 60mph if you are confused as to what it SHOULD be). For the privilege of crossing said bridge, GoodToGo charges me $3.90. So I am paying you $3.90 for 90 seconds... or $2.60 a minute. I drive 520 often and have based my bill off those numbers. Dang, some of those 900-number girls are cheaper per minute.

I spent 45 minutes fixing a problem you caused. 45 minutes x $2.60 is $117. So, to compensate me for my lost time I will charge you an equivalent amount. 

There we have it... A number we can put on government stupidity... Or maybe that is too harsh as GoodToGo is a contracted company working on behalf of my government.... Now I am not sure who is the more incompetent party, the contractor or the government that hired them...

Please send a check for the amount of $117 to the address associated with my account number (available below on the email you sent me) or you could also just put it in my GoodToGo account as a credit. Whatever is easiest for you. 

Please let me know what method of payment you will be making, or if you need me to send you an electronic invoice that you can pay online via a Credit Card.  I am willing and able to accommodate you (imagine that!).

I hope you have a great day and a happy holiday season.

Give her a few days to get used to you.  Put food on the floor several feet away from you, and sit still while talking quietly to her.  Don't move while she eats, and don't stare at her.  Move the food a little closer to you each time.  Don't touch her while she eats.

Don't touch her belly, and focus early pets on her face (cheeks and chin) when she starts to warm up to you.

Let her hide.  And let her initiate contact initially.

Thanks for adopting a difficult kitty.  ",,,,youhatemeandihateyou,,,1451179255,t5_2qhad,t3_3yc4td,t3_3yc4td,10,1451872485,0,0,cycai08,Seattle,10,,

"These things - each and every one of them - have a direct bearing on quality of education.

Teacher compensation affects educational quality because a teacher who has to take a second job (an awfully common thing) to be able to afford to live within any reasonable distance of his school is no longer able to devote extra time and energy to students, prepare strong lessons, or effectively process the mountains of homework and grading that define his non-classroom time.

Teacher discipline affects educational quality because these days, for every ""bad"" teacher you hear about, there are ten more who were falsely accused of malfeasance by students and even by parents. Often, this is a response to a bad grade, or to a disciplinary action, or to a perceived bias, or even just disgruntlement about the amount of homework the teacher assigns. It's amazingly common, and without the representation and defense abilities of the union, too many of those teachers would be gaslighted right out of the classroom.

Workload affects educational quality - shouldn't that be obvious? A teacher who has to teach classes all day without breaks or prep periods is an ineffective teacher. Teachers are required to participate in many meetings outside of school hours, some useful, some not. Without the unions, those meetings would multiply drastically. Ask a teacher sometime if her principal has ever tried to unilaterally add responsibilities to her workload in order to curry favor with the school board or the PTA. The unions protect against these things, allowing teachers more time to prepare, grade, and even rest and see their families. The unions ensure that teachers are given in-hours prep time as both a break and as a time to (as the name implies) prepare for upcoming classes.

Political influence - now that's a doozy. Teachers need political influence but entirely too often lack the time and means to go up to Olympia and glad-hand their legislators, or to fight back against the for-profit textbook companies, or to push back against brain-dead educational ""plans"" foisted upon them by government at city, state, and federal levels. A single teacher cannot effectively combat these things. A union can, and does. This massively impacts educational quality by giving the experts - you know, the teachers who have studied for six years or more, taken hours and hours of additional training at their own expense in their personal time (as mandated by WA state law), and have actual classroom experience teaching actual kids - a larger, more effective say, via the union, in how public education will and should be run.

Teachers spend all their time looking out for their students; unions make this possible by doing the work of looking out for the teachers. It's worrisome that you regard this as self-interest.",,,,macclearich,,,1449280504,t5_2qhad,t3_3vfj8g,t1_cxnlff2,12,1451446860,0,0,cxnn5s0,Seattle,12,,

"I think you need to consider more than just finding like minded people when deciding to make such a big move. People here are not as friendly and open as you'll find in the south, and judging by your relationship experience, you probably aren't the most outgoing person in the world, so it may be hard to put yourself out there (this is an assumption and I definitely could be wrong). Your career choice doesn't sound like it will be bringing in the big bucks either, and Seattle is one of the most expensive cities to live in the country, so you'll probably end up living further out of the city core, extending your commute to work/entertainment and making it that much more difficult to socialize (at least if you enjoy doing stuff in the city...which I would assume would be the case from someone looking to move to a big city). On the other hand, Nashville is considerably closer to home, so you probably have family/friends you could fall back to if things don't work out. As you're aware, Seattle is probably as far as you can get in the US, not an easy trip. 


I'm not trying to dissuade you from moving here, I've just seen a lot of people suddenly decide they want to move with not a great deal of thought given to it, and end up completely broke before they know what happened. If you can get a job offer before you move here, that's another story.

"The government doesn't need to do this at all - that's a massively inefficient way to produce housing and requires massive taxation that nobody here will ever agree to anyway. In Asia and Europe, in places with a lot of public housing, you have access problems much like ours - some number of people can live where they want to, and many more are excluded.

I think I'm seeing you approach this with a false dichotomy. The *reason* housing is so expensive is that we limit how much can be built, everywhere. Just a few decades ago, before we started hitting our limits with nearly every new building, housing was quite affordable due to filtering; new housing becomes cheap as newer housing replaces it (just like any durable good - such as cell phones and cars).

There's a good study on this which shows how the market has always solved this need before we started seriously restricting upward growth:

"Except that this isn't capitalism. There aren't competitors in the area competing for profit, and there's no on cashing out from this increase in toll. This is opposite of capitalism. Public work like this is something that's *suppose* to be a socialist work. And I fully support public utilities. The toll prices aren't rising because there are share holders waiting to cash out. It's rising because the road is getting fuller, and the DoT is still trying to keep express line ""express"", aka under 45 min by their standard. So they try and impose stricter incentive to not use the express toll lane. So it's not shitty because people are greedy. It's shitty because the task at hand is complicated and fast growing, and the people who were put in a position of responsibility are under pressure, underfunded, under-accountable and possibly a bit incompetent. Seattle area is growing fast, and it's no surprise (although no excuse) that our infrastructure is lagging.

So all in all, this work is not at all capitalist, and the reason behind the price increase is due to poor public work and not at all profit driven.

"Almost live was the best. It was uniquely Seattle, it was funny, it attracted talent. Skits like this were great, and well done, they put effort into it. 

Someone needs to tell those Cashman goons on 'Up late NW', or '206', or whatever the hell they're calling it this week, that they're not funny, seemingly put little to no effort into the show, and don't deserve the airtime their given. I don't get the creative decision on the part of King 5 to not try and emulate 'Almost Live' again to its full glory, because otherwise, creating an even lower budget show, with less skits, less writers (if they even have any) and less talent just creates an empty husk of a show.

"I've been to the SeaTac airport fire station and got a brief tour through a semi they have there for mass casualties.  My guide said that it was built and stocked with the intention of responding and triaging as many injured as one might possibly get from two 747s colliding.  Standing in the back of the truck, one side was just bins of stores: PPE for responders, splits, bandages, all that stuff.  The forward area and the other side was just hundreds upon hundreds of litter-boards for carrying people away from the disaster.  

My guide also told us about the drill they'd done with it, pretty recently.  They got a couple hundred volunteers to get made up and screaming, and within that group he had placed a few amputees they'd hired, and rigged them with fake limbs so the limb could come right off as the (unknowing) rescuer intervened.  Limb came off, blood started pouring, and they started screaming in agony; he said it was very effective in startling any rescuers who happened to see it.

"The problem is that ""Find my iPhone"" does not constitute probable cause in the eyes of many judges. I believe this fact was discussed in Danny Westneat's column [a while back.](http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/privacy-laws-applied-backward/) 

Police can't enter a home without a warrant and can't arrest someone without probable cause. On top of all that, theft of a phone or iPad is a gross misdemeanor. This is not some easy case where the police could roll up and make an arrest. They'd have to spend hours investigating and writing warrants for a misdemeanor case.
