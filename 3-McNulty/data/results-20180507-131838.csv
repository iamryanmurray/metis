The largest deficit Clinton faced in 2008 was 146 delegates, and that was late in the race when it was largely seen as going to Obama already. Even when you account for the fact that there are approximately 25% more delegates this primary than back then, that'd still only be about a 183 deficit (overly simplified math, but the result wouldn't be too far off). Sanders so far has experienced a 324 delegate deficit at the highest and is *still* 232 down in ""the thick of the race"".

That guard is a minimum wage worker with no skills and sat down to watch a video as ""training"".  
That company's instructions include harassing homeless, and vehicular homeless.
Andrew was sitting for a long time in an older car, and either a business owner or one of their patrols decided he needed to be asked to move on.

"why do people always try to pretend more taxes is better.  Look at the highest taxed states (I came from one) people flee and it NEVER...EVER helps the poor.

what ends up happening is that the middle class gets taxed to high heaven

Also, I'm sick to death of the incorrect usage of the word ""fair"" when it comes to taxes.  Taxing certain people more than others isn't fair.  Just because you make 70-100k a year doesn't mean your swimming in pools of hundred dollar bills and need to give up more just for doing well either.  Its not regressive to tax everyone at the same rate, that is equal, that is fair.  Stop with the bullshit.

I'm all for making sure people earning 1mil or more a year actually pay, which is the problem.  I'm not for adding tax burden on the middle class because that's who is going to end up paying the bulk of any new taxes or ""fair"" taxes that give the poor a free pass by taxing a higher percent for those who have their act together.

I'm guessing these types of initiatives are from people who fled California due to all the problems there and cant connect the dots properly as to why it sucks living there and have decided they need to wreck their transplanted location.

I say, keep Washington unique with tax code.  I'm all for sales taxes (taxes that actually hit wealthy people a bit harder since they tend to spend more on expensive items and luxuries) and leave peoples pay checks alone.

"This is correct. And the nuance you're differentiating is actually covered under an entire branch of philosophy called 'propositional logic'. This particular example is a deductive argument called a 'Categorical Syllogism'. The italics of the two statements can be interpreted and broken down as such to the following two statements:

* Not all Things are Dog poop. ⇒ *Some T are not D.*

* Not all Poop is Dog poop. ⇒ *Some P is not D.*

The two re-written statements are shown above in standard form. From these two statements, from which a third one, the conclusion, is inferred.

* Not all Things are Poop. ⇒ *Some T are not P.*

____________________

The terms used above can be broken down as such:

Word|Term|Type
:--|:--|:--
Things|T|Major Term
Dog Poop|D|Middle Term
Poop|P|Minor Term

To structure it better:

    Some T are not D. (Major Premise)
    Some P is not D. (Minor Premise)
    =============================
    Some T are not P. (Conclusion)

Each categorical syllogism will have 3 terms, a Major Premise, Minor Premise and a Conclusion. The arguments can be further described with the following attributes.

Statement|Designation|Quantity|Quality|Distribution
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--
Some T are not D|O|Particular|negative|predicate only
Some P is not D|O|Particular|negative|predicate only
Some T are not P|O|Particular|negative|predicate only

In the distribution, predicate only means that some of the subject will not be distributed in the class defined by the predicate.

To look at this argument visually, we can build a Venn diagram for each statement, as shown below:

* [Major Premise](http://i.imgur.com/s17Y2Tn.jpg)

* [Minor Premise](http://i.imgur.com/hRVpgJx.jpg)

* [Combined](http://i.imgur.com/w5eM2Pl.jpg)

In the abstract where Some T is not D and Some P is not D, there is no way to assure validity, so in the end this argument is not valid.

""By the eyeball test, the scale of the revenue lost by Kasich's tax cuts will be absolutely massive. Kasich would cut the top tax rate to 28 percent from its current 39.6 percent rate. He would cut the capital gains tax rate from 25 percent to 15 percent, cut the estate tax rate from 40 percent to zero, cut the business tax rate from 35 percent to 25 percent, and allow businesses to immediately write off the full cost of all investments — a tax cut for the rich of a scale never before seen in American history. Kasich would also expand the Earned Income Tax Credit for the working poor, which is nice, though it further raises questions as to where he will find the trillions of dollars in savings to pay for all this. Kasich’s campaign tells me that he believes deep tax cuts will encourage faster growth, undeterred by the clear past failure of his beliefs about tax rates and growth.""

"For almost 50 years now, Seattleites like have [voted down](http://seattlish.com/post/83663717975/on-blast-90-years-of-fucked-up-seattle-public) any efforts to make modern, functional, forwarding thinking programs to create transit and better transit infrastructure. 

* In 1968, voters approved the Kingdome, but rejected transit  

* In [1970](http://www.seattletimes.com/business/economy/the-mass-transit-system-seattle-might-have-had-jon-talton/), voters rejected four transit-related bonds, causing the federal government to reroute transit aid to Atlanta instead of here.  

* In [1972](http://metro.kingcounty.gov/am/history/history-1970.html) voters allow a small transit tax for busses, but reject the tax for electric rail. (Even the meager vote for busses was the first time Seattleites approved new taxes for transit since 1918)  

* In [1995](http://metro.kingcounty.gov/am/history/history-1990.html), voters reject a Regional Transit Authority (later Sound Transit) measure for a gigantic, $6.7 billion transportation system over three counties that would’ve featured commuter rail, light rail, express buses, and expanded HOV lanes 

* In 1999, with Initiative 695, local voters show their love of Tim Eyman and regressivism- scrapping the progressive car excise fee for a super-regressive $30 state car tabs. Since 29% of the vehicle excise tax went to local transit, local communities have been scrambling to keep their buses running ever since. 

* In 2002, voters showed their hatred of forward-thinking transit/infrastructure funding and support an Eyman initiative yet again: voters approved I-776,which restricted local governments from adding their own excise taxes and limited local license tab fees. While the measure was shot down at first for being unconstitutional, it was upheld by the State Supreme Court in October 2003. 776 repealed many taxes that the public had [already voted on](https://researchcouncil.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/initiative776.pdf)  

* In [2005](http://www.seattlepi.com/local/transportation/article/Monorail-will-go-to-voters-for-5th-time-1183631.php), Mayor Nickels gets the ""all-or-nothing"" plan for a West Seattle-Ballard monorail on the ballot. The plan is a watered down, poor version of the original, so it failed. Its rejection gutted Seattle Monorail Partners, which had been working to upgrade our transit system since they were created by a public vote in 1997. Council President Jan Drago (accurately) expressed fear that not building the monorail segment means ""we will pass it to future generations."" **Now look where we are!** 

* In [2011](http://seattlest.com/2011/07/13/last_night_people_are_voting_with_t.php): The Congestion Reduction Fee. When our regressive and outdated sales tax revenue plummets during the recession – the King County Council approves a $20 fee on vehicle tabs to make up the $60 million deficit, collected in 2012  through 2014  

* In [2014](http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/with-transit-money-approved-seattle-pledges-to-spend-new-dollars-well/), Seattleites vote *FOR* maintaining some bus transit, with more regressive taxes - a $60 car-tab fee and a 0.1 percent sales-tax increase - to keep many bus lines from being cut and to expand services on a couple bus lines.

"Oh god, that's a deep rabbit hole. Quick summary: By having it a measure that's voted on it leaves the plan open to political pandering to voters who really tend to know jack shit, not by what would provide the most number of people with the highest quality service for the least amount of money. Case in point, no sane planner would spend bajillions of dollars to build a line up to Everett before building an *extensive* system in Seattle proper. But the way ST is set up we not only have to pander to voters, you have to pander to voters in each subarea. So we'll build lines with really high cost and low ridership just so we can build actually useful lines in other subareas.

The planning of core infrastructure shouldn't be put up to a direct vote. You should vote for a representative who then confers with actual experts, and together they put together the plan and funding. Putting it to a direct vote results in a radial spoke map like what was posted, where they try and extend a line as much as possible into every direction so they can point to a map and tell voters, ""Look, Snohomish/Pierce/whatever County is a getting a line! Vote for it!"" regardless of the relative usefulness of that line.

This is why there's no east-west line for Seattle on the map. This is why Belltown--one of the densest areas in the state--isn't on the map. This is why the CD--another hotspot for potential ridership--isn't on the map. There are already some lines drawn in Seattle to get Seattle votes, so they have to go and draw low-ridership spokes elsewhere to try and get those votes.",,,,shoeson,,,1458073282,t5_2qhad,t3_4ajlyy,t1_d10yijn,29,1460665855,0,0,d111peh,Seattle,29,,

"&gt; ""Democratic Socialism"" and ""capitalism"" aren't mutually exclusive.

I would add that Democratic Socialism is dependent upon Capitalism. As a system, there is incentive to maintain capitalism as a robust and balanced system in which to supply the social nets. It is quite pro-capitalism, just not pro-corporatism or the ever mythical laissez-faire capitalism. 

Many Socialists would argue that ""Democratic Socialism"", the kind that Bernie supports, is truly a capitalist system in itself due to the fact that it does not fit within the definition of socialism (being worker or publicly owned means of production).

&gt;As far as being ""selfish,"" you want a labor pool of qualified and educated workers. You want a middle class that can afford to buy your goods and services. You want to live in a community in which the infrastructure is sound, the bridges are safe, the water unleaded, 

Macro vs Micro Economics. Unfortunately, most micro-econ folk (that dominate Reddit disproportionately) cannot see the bigger picture. A higher minimum wage hurts one business (increases labor costs) but helps most all businesses (increases purchasing power of the consumer). 

Welfare is a heavy tax burden on one business (increased operating cost), but makes living operating cheaper for most all businesses (shifts labor cost as the individual business would have to pay for that were it not available). 

Paying for your workers' education is expensive, but a long term education cycle that is paid for in advance creates a far superior labor pool to increase the value of your business in the long run. 

The basic economic arguments you propose go right over the head of most of the pro-capitalist crowd on Reddit (as that half of the conversation tends to be dominated by a vocal minority relative to the greater pro-capitalist population, Laissez-Faire/Right-Libertarians/AnCaps).",,,,TheLateThagSimmons,Fremont,,1458914616,t5_2qhad,t3_4bv1x6,t1_d1cr80c,12,1460872441,0,0,d1czzgr,Seattle,12,,flair

"From my experience this is how every bike share I've encountered works. Chicago &amp; Madison have the same system. It's a low price for 1/2 an hour and then the tired pricing kicks in. Even if you pay the $80 or whatever annual membership fee you get an unlimited number of 30 minute ride, but you're charged for rides &gt; 30 minute. IMO people have a poor understanding of what a bike share is &amp; it's not their fault. In Seattle at least Pronto has really done a poor job of educating the public, in other cities (see:Chicago) this is not the case. Bike shares aren't for dilly dallying around a city or taking a joy ride along the BGT, but they're for quick transit between two distant(ish) places.  It's like a bike version of Car2Go. If you need to get from pike place market to Safeco field a bike share is a wonderful option. If you want to tour around the city on a bike then you may want to consider renting one from a local bike shop.  It's more of a utilitarian public transit option &amp; less of a ""weeee I'm on a bike this is fun"" option.

"Yes I am in the Seattle area. Things I like about Trump;
Tough on immigration. This does not come from any hatred of any sort of race of people. I used to be more of an open borders person until I had a conversation with an Indian man who is a Microsoft employee. He told me about the process he went through to bring himself and his family into the United States. It took him years of hard work to get granted citizenship. He told me of the price her felt with it. Currently, there are at least 10 million illegal immigrants in our country. They come through various means of overstaying H1b visas, Mexican border, etc. I realize they probably came from bad situations searching a better life. But right from the get go they decided to not follow the laws of our nation. I along with Mr. Trump would fully support letting a majority back if they came back legally. I'll admit that the wall may be a bit overkill but all 4 gop candidates seem to be on board with a wall now.

Second reason
I do realize I am sort of voting against my interests being a union worker not voting democrat. But both Hilary and Bernie would like to expand government at a time while we are in massive and increasing debt. Before we can offer ""free college"", we should first try to chip away at that trillions of dollars. Ideally Rand Paul would have been my choice for this but he is no longer running.

Third reason
He wants to audit the federal reserve. Another thing Rand Paul was on board with (Bernie was one of the only democrats to agree on this, I'll give him credit for that). Last president to want to do that was Kennedy whom I am very fond of though he was before my time.

Fourth reason
He supports medical marijuana. I am for full legalization but his stance is better than the rest of the gop. I understand that Bernie is for full legalization but this issue isn't enough to sway my vote.

Fifth reason
He isn't running on ""religious family values"" like Ted Cruz. Fuck Ted Cruz (we probably agree on that!). I never believe any politician that says that.

Sixth reason
Wants to be friends with Russia. I am generally against war. This is good in my eyes. Making enemies with Russia= bad.

Seventh reason 
Lower corporate tax rate to bring businesses back to the United States. I am always pro jobs. Carrier just announced they will be moving to Mexico. I do Hvac for a living and the company I work for has decided to no longer install Carrier anything. I am always pro jobs.

"What about suburban and exurban residents? 

King Co. has seen a massive displacement of lower income and minority populations to outlying suburbs, typifies what researchers call the [“suburbanization of poverty.”](http://realchangenews.org/2013/05/29/researchers-find-south-king-county-typifies-suburbanization-poverty) Researchers examining the suburbanization of poverty have highlighted South King County as a prime example of this trend, where suburban areas both see a growth in the number of low-income residents, and a [decline](http://www.brookings.edu/research/books/2013/confrontingsuburbanpovertyinamerica) in living wage job opportunities. 

These shifts also contribute to a form of geographic inequality: as lower income minorities are forced further from the city core, commutes to jobs increase in length, and access to convenient public transit [declines](http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/reports/2015/03/24-job-proximity/srvy_jobsproximity.pdf).  As was the case nationally, lower income regions of Seattle’s suburbs were more likely to see a loss of jobs within close proximity between 2009 and 2012.

You could not be more incorrect on your assumptions here.

 I-594 redefines what ""legal transfer of ownership"" is so ambiguously that one man handing his rifle to a friend out in the country while target shooting is now considered a transfer of ownership. A transfer of ownership done with out a background check is a misdemeanor. When the mans friend hands the rifle back to him that is a second transfer of ownership which by law is now a felony. 

Absolutely nothing was changed or amended regarding the language of the law that I just discussed.

This has absolutely nothing to do with "" reasonable gun safety measures"" and has everything to do with making ordinary law abiding citizens Felons. 

Time and time again the anti second amendment crowd does not even understand the laws that they talk about &amp; suggest and what the actual legal effect of them is. ",,,,Whole_cord,Shoreline,,1459207554,t5_2qhad,t3_4cbsrv,t1_d1gsehh,13,1460941252,0,0,d1gzntc,Seattle,13,,flair

"Aaron was always a huge influence for me as a bassist. I, like many people in the late 90s, loved ""Where Have All the Merrymakers Gone"". It wasn't until their follow up album ""The King James Version"" did I really appreciate their songwriting. I started listening to lots of Ben Folds Five around the same time, and both bands really went hand in hand for me. Sean Nelson was always a fantastic lyricist and frontman, but man did I love the bass lines. Bass guitar was used in many cases to carry the melody of the song, whether it was dirtied up with a RAT pedal on Flagpole Sitta or Carlotta Valdez, or clean and groovy on Why I'm Lonely; bass could just as easily drive the melody with guitar acting as more of a rudimentary foundation. Where many bands had a cool guitar lick, Harvey Danger had a sweet bass line - often without anybody noticing the difference. 
In the years following my move to Seattle, working in Capitol Hill, I had the pleasure of serving Aaron coffee and cupcakes on several occasions. Only once or twice did I sneak in a little ""Hey man, I really loved your band,"" and he was always very nice and humble. I could go on and on about all my favorite HD songs and what not, but instead I'll just say that I am seriously bummed that Aaron is no longer with us.

"IF they are squawking at 3:30am, it's probably because the owner has supplemental light in the coop to keep them laying through the darker winter months. You might ask them if they'd be willing to kill the light so the chickens will keep a normal sleeping schedule.

Also, in my limited chicken keeping experience, hens tend to make the most noise when they're laying eggs for the first time after a break from laying. So a 6 mo old chicken may be laying eggs for the first time in it's life. Or if the chicken had taken a break from laying during the darker winter months, they might be starting up again.

"So I see some confusion in this thread about this location, so I'll offer some clarity.

This 7/11 is located on the north side of S 112 ST. This particular section of S 112 ST is the dividing line between the City of Burien and unincorporated King County. If this has occurred at the Chevron gas station across the street it would be in the City of Burien. As it occurred on the north side, it is unincorporated King County.

Then there is the White Center/South Park/Bouelvard Park debate. All three of these are unofficial areas that do not have borders that are recognized by King County. The closest one to this 7/11 would be Boulevard Park, but South Park area is also just a few blocks north. In the end it doesn't really matter, it is all unincorporated King County.

Also, ""Burien PD"" is a contract with the King County Sheriff's Office. They are one in the same.

"Looks like I am a late to the posting party.  Just wanted to share an experience that happened to me.  

We used to rent a small home on a good slope, about 3-4 houses back from Lake Washington, which had a just a couple of small views of the water.  Here's a pic of the view, and you can see some of the taller tress which had middle branches trimmed in the frame.  http://i.imgur.com/hOsoKib.jpg?1  On the bottom right, you can just see the waterfront.

Across the street, ""above"" us as the slope went, the 1950's rambler (the street was originally lined with them) had been town down, and a $5 million, large, gated, modern looking huge house we referred to as ""the fortress"" was recently built.   The owner was said to be a wealthy Taiwanese who bought it for his kids to live in while they went to school.  I say 'said' as although we got to know and talk with almost all our neighbors on the street, we never had any interaction with the people in the fortress beyond seeing expensive cars occasionally come and go, except for one time.

That one time we spoke with them?   ""How much money to cut those trees down?"" the lady asked me as I was out getting my mail.  I tried to explain to her but she didn't even understand that we were just renters, not the owners.  She was totally arrogant about buying the view of the lake.  That was the extent of our conversation the entire time we lived there.

So yeah.  You can guess who I think did it.

"I'm one of the remaining 1900 and am also not planning to renew.  The rental time lengths are far too short and the locations are all near areas already well served by transit.

I signed up as part of a $30/year deal through work and am a very infrequent user - I wonder how many others in the remaining 1900 are in a similar situation, inflating the ridership numbers even further.  I suspect many of the 1000 who already churned off the service fit that description...

If the city really wants to make this thing work, they should immediately double the length of rentals (from 30 minutes to one hour).  The next step is to put future stations in places people actually want to ride bikes to;  most importantly, Fremont, which would create a virtuous triangle between SLU/Fremont/U District that might actually get used.

edit:  my bf works as an insurance underwriter for a local company that insures bars/restaurants across the country. We were talking about something that happened to his work yesterday.

"&gt; She was wrong to start breaking windows, the van owner was wrong for parking there for two months and littering the area with used needles, and the police were wrong for not resolving the situation when it was reported.

This pretty much sums it up, there were certianly no winners in this story. This situation is a good example of why it would be nice if the SPD had the resources, and or motivation, to address property crimes on a more regular basis.

If cops had responded earlier, and made contact with the van dwellers, they might have gotten the idea that the cops were on to them and just maybe, in an effort to continue to get high without police scrutiny, they might have started to dump less trash, and move around more often in order to stay on the DL. 

Similarly, if the lady had gotten a response to her complaints, resulting in the van dudes moving on sooner than two 'effin months, she probably would have been satisfied and refrained from going psycho and attacking the van with a hammer, and avoided a pretty serious beat down.

"Lots of good questions and discussion on there, thanks! To help with a couple things:
We have a grand opening event planned for April 2-3 for the new SR 520 bridge: http://www.520golong.com/ 
You can learn more about the new bridge - which will actually open to traffic sometime in April/May, here: http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/Projects/SR520Bridge/
Here's some info on why we would close the current SR 520 bridge: http://www.wsdot.com/traffic/bridges/sr520/update/whyclose.htm
There will be no more scheduled monthly maintenance openings of the current bridge since the new bridge is opening soon. But if for some reason we have another wind storm that causes us to close the bridge before the new one opens, one message I can't stress enough: Please don't stop on the bridge. I know it can be scary, but the safest thing to do is to keep driving until you reach the other side. We have people who abandon their cars and walk/run across, which is both not safe (those winds/waves are no joke), slows down our ability to open the bridge up/close it to traffic (because we have to get a tow out there to remove the vehicles) and jams up traffic, making it hard for other people to get off the bridge.

"&gt;It honestly sounds like a problem with who you surround yourself with. I voted in the caucus last week and felt inspired by the quality and civility of the debate that occurred within my precinct among complete strangers.

The problem is that most of our exposure to Bernie supporters isn't at caucuses. It's in the media, at bars and restaurants, workplaces, schools.

Most of my personal exposure to actual supporters is through reddit and other social media, where Berners consistently claim that Hillary is losing despite her delegate lead. It's hard to read that repeated and not take away some sense of head-in-sand thinking.

It's also hard to read the vitriol I hear here and on /r/politics from Bernie supporters aimed at anyone who dares to voice support for Hillary, who ""obviously"" is a corporate shill (as is anyone who supports her, by extension).

To be clear: I like Bernie a lot. I love that he is pushing Hillary and the primary in general to the left. I love the spotlight he's brought to talking about what most people think is a broken system. Most of the peers I interact with feel the same way. **But** I also have a lot of respect for Hillary. I cannot bring myself to feel disgust at the prospect of a former Secretary of State becoming President. I've read some of her (very detailed) policy proposals, and they're just really well thought out for the most part. She's deeply ingrained in the system, it's true. But Obama wasn't, and it bit him hard during the second half of his presidency.

"It's kind of ridiculous that people still even use studded winter tires. Tire technology and rubber compounds have improved dramatically in the past couple of decades.

Studless do not suffer in dry/rain conditions to nearly the same extent that studded tires do. They also don't cause the additional road damage that studded tires do, or make a bunch of godawful metal-on-pavement noise.

TireRack, among many others, have done extensive testing on studded vs. studless and the data overwhelmingly shows that studless are the smarter choice in 99.9% of situations. http://blog.tirerack.com/blog/hot-seller/why-go-with-studless-ice-and-snow-tires

* Sounder South Line extension to DuPont via JBLM station at Tillicum  
* Everett Link via Paine Field and industrial area  
* Bus rapid transit on I-405 and SR 522

"What's worse, the people that need public transit the most are being pushed further and further away from their workplace, increasing their commute times and reliance on driving.

Researchers examining the suburbanization of poverty have highlighted [South King County as a prime example of this trend](http://realchangenews.org/2013/05/29/researchers-find-south-king-county-typifies-suburbanization-poverty), where suburban areas see both a growth in the number of low-income residents, and a decline in living wage job opportunities.

These shifts also contribute to a form of [geographic inequality](http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/reports/2015/03/24-job-proximity/srvy_jobsproximity.pdf): as lower income minorities are forced further from the city core, commutes to jobs increase in length, and access to convenient public transit declines.

As was the case nationally, lower income regions of Seattle’s suburbs were more likely to see a loss of jobs within close proximity between 2009 and 2012. [This coincides](http://grist.org/cities/seattle-transportation-woes/) with the unequal distribution of public transit throughout King County: as low-income individuals move further from the city core, they are less likely to have access to transit, or transit-accessible jobs.

"Went to Mars Hill and participated in community groups, and also volunteered time on their production team. I gotta say, I'm mixed in how I feel. While there were things I liked about some of Mark's sermons it seemed like the most joy I got was from the people I met, and connected with. I'm not really that religious, and never donated any money. The thing that bothered me most was the insane production value put into videos and promotions, and also some of the ""acting"" that I saw when attending multiple sermons to jerk the emotions of people into reacting and becoming members. A forced attempted at seeming HIP. There were actually tons of hipsters and cliques there as well, and that's at every church, which Is a thing I dislike. The church business is very driven off of thriving off of people's emotions, or vulnerabilities. It's very psychological. You're very likely to find many people at churches who are going through difficult times in their life and don't know where to turn. When things improve you may never see those people again until hardship arises and they need a community to talk to. I grew up in a fairly Christian family, and I'm not really a believer, but I will say that I appreciate the community at mars hill for taking me in when I went through a rough patch and didn't really have anyone reliable to turn to for friends.

"Good god this would be a relief for so many people.

When I worked at Safeway, this was a huuuuge problem. Schedules were only for a single week and released only the Thursday before, thus you could be scheduled to work Sunday and not know until a few days in advance. They would also take advantage of the short breaks between, and I had several times where a late shift ending at 11:30 or something saw me go home, head to sleep, then wake up for a 7:30 shift or something the next day. Being a teenager without too many responsibilities, it was a pain in terms of making a social life happen, but those practices applied to everyone. Lots of my co-workers, ones who had families and kids, had to go through the constant frustration of the bullshit that a lot of these companies pull on a weekly basis. One of the ones I remember most was that technically they could only schedule you five days in a row during a work week, but that didn't apply if it ran over into the next scheduling week. After I gave my two-weeks notice I was scheduled for seven days in a row, four from Wednesday to Saturday, and three more from the 'new week' Sunday to Tuesday.

"""...it looked like an awesome place to just relax, read a book, concentrate on writing, etc."" 

You would think a place full of books and knowledge would draw those who like - books and knowledge.

But more and more, libraries are places for people to hang out and talk (loudly), surf the web, use it as free babysitting as kids run amok, making copies, and playing card/board games.   They have become community centers, **which is fine - just stop the fiction that libraries are about books, reading and learning**: call it a community center, and move all the books to a central location and let us readers request them via internet, then pick them up.

ETA: Oh, and the DVD section gets bigger and bigger and is more of a draw than books.

There are times I'd love to hang out read some of the visual arts magazines available (very $$$ to subscribe to) but the sheer noise and chaos makes that impossible and irritating.

"It is not a matter of wether they like or dislike Sanders, agree or disagree with him. It is about the DNC establishment deciding that Clinton would be the nominee a long time ago. Superdelegates who ignore the will of the people are frankly anti-democratic and deserve to be replaced if they decide not represent their state properly.

"I'm no Battalion Chief, but I'm in a leadership position at work and here's what I have learned about being a good leader. 

- You ALWAYS stand back and let your team accept the praise for their successes. If you are individually praised for the accomplishments, you should always mention that it was the team that made it possible. If your team is consistently successful, your leadership will be noticed by the people that matter, you don't need a pat on the back from the Governor. 

- Don't complain that life isn't fair, because it's not. If you complain to your boss it better be about something that affects your team members, or the organization as a whole, don't make it about you. 

- FFS don't go public with your grievances unless it's a whistle-blowing situation and you expect a movie to be made about you, and you plan to make your future living off speaking engagements.  

Also, FWIW, I was recently passed over for a promotion, and one of the critiques was that I had too much of an ""edge"" and needed to soften it up. Rather than calling the Seattle Times, I'm taking the criticism to heart, and working on it.

"This is why we need to get rid of unmarked intersections. Yes, you always yield to the right, but you can't trust anyone to do it correctly. There are a ton of these around my apartment. Due to the cars parked right up on the intersection you have to come to a complete stop to check anyways, but it would be nice knowing there is a stop sign for oncoming traffic so you're not at such a risk poking your front end out into the intersection just to see if it's clear. 

It's the same problem with the small traffic circles. Yes they would be more efficient than a four way if you had a clear line of sight but you never do because of how cars park by them.

"&gt; But why would we expect rents and estate values to be at parity with construction costs?

Take a look at the article, or at *[Principles of Economics](http://www.amazon.com/Principles-Economics-7th-Gregory-Mankiw/dp/128516587X)*; in open real estate markets (or commodity markets), prices tend to decline to near the marginal cost of construction. 

That's what happened [in most of the U.S. until the 1970s](http://jakeseliger.com/2015/12/27/why-did-cities-freeze-in-the-1970s/), when parochial land-use controls became common. People today seem to treat rising prices as a law of nature or a positive thing, when in fact relentlessly rising prices is a relatively unusual phenomenon, and even it [is not universal](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2007/11/a-tale-of-two-town-houses/306334/).

I've lived in Seattle my whole life and the longest vacation I've been on was about two weeks which I'd say ranks me as a PNW Hobbit; in the past 3-5 years downtown has gone from bad, to worse to horrible.  There were formerly areas to avoid and now there are areas I wouldn't recommend anyone go.  I have friends and business associates that visit from cities with far higher rates of violent crime who are shocked by the conditions and atmosphere displayed in parts of downtown.  I think what is most shocking is the widespread nature of the homelessness, open drug transactions, and violence wheras other areas of our country have a more centralized spread of such activity in certain neighborhoods while other areas remain free of such.

"Or hikers with bad joints, or just hikers who know that sometimes you need some extra stabilization, such as for uneven or unstable terrain or certain stream crossings. My poles saved my ass -- literally! -- at Mount Si last year when I slipped on the way down the rocks about a mile from the trailhead. Managed to catch myself on my poles, or I'd have fallen straight onto my tailbone, and I'm not sure I'd have made it the rest of the way back to my car. Trekking poles probably saved my life when I was a bit too set on reaching the meadow at Church Mountain last February -- I doubt I'd have been able to make it back down the icy slopes without them (and the side of the 18-inch-wide trail is a steep hillside with a drop of over a hundred feet). And [this is yesterday](http://imgur.com/CfTcAjR), when, despite not having my powder baskets with me, my poles helped me pick my way around the lake.

I hiked over 400 miles last year with over 100,000 feet of elevation gain, including the aforementioned February hike to [over 6,000 feet](https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7626/16957852811_590bd91c59_o.jpg) at Mt.

I had my trekking poles with me every damned step of the way, either extended in my hands, or collapsed tucked into my pack. You never know when they'll come in handy.

The trails are no place to be a judgemental prick about something like hiking poles; save that for the anonymous litterers.

(Oh, and I hope you meant that they don't cede the way coming down -- hikers headed up have the right of way according to standard etiquette.

"Statistically, the great majority of Seattle's homeless population is local, born in Washington State, a majority born in King County.  (Which makes sense, when you consider how hard it is to move across the country when you can't afford bus fare to get across town.)

The ""unsheltered"" homeless population (the ones you see outdoors, not the ones living in shelters or couch surfing in friends' living rooms) has risen sharply in King County over the past couple of years according to the annual January count -- up 19% in 2016, after rising 21% in 2015.  

That's a very recent, very significant increase, and it's driven by locals, not other states exporting their homeless.  

Deinstitutionalization was a significant factor decades ago, but it's now part of the run-rate, not driving the current increases.

Some of the factors driving people to the streets:

- Rapidly rising rents mean many more people are on the edge of homelessness -- less than one paycheck away from being unable to pay rent.  Most of those people aren't homeless and won't become homeless, they're just desperately poor and working their asses off to afford rents.

- When rising rents finally become too much, or a landlord evicts everyone to renovate the building or tear down and rebuild, there are a lot more people who can't scrape together first+last+deposit to get into a new rental at current market rates.  Some can couch surf for a while trying to save up the money, others move into their vehicles, they hope temporarily.

- Lower-income jobs have continued to move away from Seattle.  Seattle is an expensive place to do business if you're in an industry that depends on cheap labor.  If you move your warehouse, call center, or other low-wage business to a less-expensive market, you're less likely to pay to relocate existing employees than a business that has a lot invested in expensive human capital.  You may offer people to keep their jobs if they pay to move themselves, but you're not going to give the same relocation benefits an upper-income employee gets from a company moving *into* Seattle for its business climate.

- Some populations are more prone to homelessness for other reasons -- addicts, disabled, untreated mentally ill, veterans with undiagnosed/untreated PTSD, LGBTQ kids kicked out by their parents, etc.  They face all the same issues with rising rents and restricted housing supply, but with additional obstacles and challenges.",,,,jmputnam,,,1456855271,t5_2qhad,t3_48eeag,t3_48eeag,13,1460364572,0,0,d0jldyf,Seattle,13,,

"Man, this plan really does nothing to help alleviate the congestion/commute on the southeast side of Lake Washington. I405 along the S-Curves through Factoria is absolute hell. There are a lot of us living in Kent, Renton,  and Newcastle commuting as far north as Bothell and back each day that would kill to have a light rail option to get to and from work. All tracks routing through Seattle is idiocy.

/u/sahala is right, there is a huge lack of East-West service in these plans, which has been part of the transit problem with buses and cars for decades. I'm really hoping by ST4 they start putting in E-W feeder spurs off the main trunks, otherwise you aren't going to do as much as you think to alleviate traffic on heavily used highways and surface streets, as the folks that live out in less dense parts of the counties are still stuck in those grinds and contribute to congestion in the core as they travel through it or to it to the rail. Also, no Ballard-UW line and no 520 line into Bellevue?

I continue to remain disappointed with ST and the regional cities.

"This isn't a Seattle thing. Most major cities have these different types of tracks in their systems. It tends to be the most common sense thing to do.

SLUT and the central street car are compatible. Street cars serve different purposes than light rail. They are basically busses on rails. They allow for passage of streetcars on narrower streets and tighter turning radiuses. If you made regional light rail run on those types of tracks, you'd be really limiting the speed and capacity of those trains. 

Monorail is a simply a technology that no longer makes sense because of its unpopularity world wide: no one makes that tech anymore so everything would need to be custom. Plus the little track we have of it would probably require extensive renovations anyways to be part of a robust modern transit system.

Mixing frequent passenger trains in with heavy rail is dangerous and really bad for providing frequent service. The tracks ""we have"" are actually owned by BNSF so their freight tends to take priority. Also, because it takes so long for a freight train to come to a stop, having frequently stopping passenger trains on the same tracks is a recipe for disaster.

"This is a very important update:

&gt;In an e-mailed statement, the SPD says it ""served a warrant at the home while investigating information received from the National Center for Missing and Exploiting Children"" involving the possible distribution of child pornography.

I would very much like to see the legitimacy of said report from the NCMEC, because this would shift who is overstepping authority from SPD to the NCMEC (or whoever gave the NCMEC this information). SPD was just doing its job in this case if all they are told is someone may have something illegal, and upon investigating, that person appears to be hiding his hands behind his back, which to me is worth getting a warrant if the NCMEC is to be trusted.

If, on the other hand, the only thing NCMEC have to go on is:  
""These people are hiding their internet activities. CP distributors often hide their internet activities. Therefor, these people may be distributing CP and should be searched.""  
Then we have a problem.

*/u/Seattle_PD responded below:
&gt;This investigation began when 4Chan made a report to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) and provided the IP address of a user who, on February 5th, had uploaded a video of a woman sexually abusing a toddler. NCMEC referred the information to SPD's Internet Crimes Against Children unit, which began investigating the case.

So it looks like a legit reason for a warrant to me with no one overstepping themselves. Having a TOR exit point in your home does not and should not make you immune to investigation (and it is very foolish to have one in your own home to begin with), since an IP address is often all police have to go on I would consider it foolish NOT to investigate the only location linked to CP.

"It's absolutely hilarious that people try to blame high property crime on the police. Not the general public and elected officials who have voiced time and time again that non-violent crime should be given minimal repercussions. Not the prosecutors who ignore RCW definitions of crime and create their own filing standards, in order to create leverage to force plea bargains and increase prosecution rates. Or the same prosecutors who choose to not file charges against minorities if doing so would make it so that those minorities appear to be over-represented in crime statistics. Or the judges working with those same Prosecutors to blatantly ignore state law regarding minimum prison/jail sentences, and giving criminals who are convicted of felony crime 30 days in jail when state law says the MINIMUM is 1 year.

People continue to commit property crime because they don't care if they get caught. As a WA LEO myself, I have seen individuals be arrested for auto theft/possession of stolen motor vehicle 30+ times in a year, and NEVER see a single day in prison. I know of a woman who has been convicted of Theft-3 over 200 times, and never spent more than a week in jail, and never seen the inside of a prison.

People can continue to blame the police all they want, but even when we catch these people, nothing happens, and they are usually out the next day, doing the same stuff.

But if Bernie weren't Bernie... If he were, say, the Democratic version of a Tea Party candidate, who represented all of the worst uncompromising parts of the Democratic party, then the super delegates would at least be a mild hedge against a total part take over. 

It's similar to the design of congress. What's the opposite of progress? Congress. And that's a good thing. It's designed (in part) to be slow moving to act as a barrier against sweeping political movements like those that brought on Fascism.

1. Going to a caucus is much more of a commitment vs filling out a ballot at home and mailing it in. It requires time and travel, both of which are difficult for some people.

The bit where he says that Washington is 35th in the nation for combined taxes has a rate of $97 per $1000 of income, it also shows the US average at $112 per $1000 of income.

This site from the state of Washington, dated 2013, has the rate at $142.51 per $1000 of income, much, much higher than the $97 claimed in the video and far higher than the US average:

http://www.ofm.wa.gov/trends/revenue/fig502.asp

"For now the big barrier is L. Washington -- hence only one pair of tracks crossing it. However, do not confuse a single crossing with insufficient capacity. There can be a train on I90 bridge every 3 minutes in each direction, and where they go on the Eastside is up for discussion. There is no requirement for the Issaquah line , for example, needs to go to Kirkland. It may head to Redmond or to Seattle. Those are all possibilities. 

Further, we will eventually need more crossings, and ST3 will include study $$ for one of them -- ""north of I90 bridge"" -- strategically named to include both the 520 bridge and its own bridge. Sadly, the new 520 bridge is not actually built for light rail, making its conversion for light rail possible, but expensive. 
And given this cost, the 520 crossing is poorly positioned. So instead ST will also  study a dedicated bridge at the extension of Ballard to UW line which would cross somewhere south of NOAA to roughly the Google campus in Kirkland. 

ST is being quite pragmatic about this -- seeking lines that do the most in terms of the aspects ST cares about: 
1) ridership / being profitable when up and running
2) presenting reasonable construction cost 
and 
3) drumming up support for ST3 and future ballots. 

As the article well illustrates, the current Kirkland fiasco shows how much an ignorant city government and a vocal small group of citizens can undermine the will of the community at large. Kirkland citizens that ST has talked to largely want rail, but city want busses, and small group of citizens (Who bought houses by the ROW dedicated to future transit) want no transit in that ROW next to which they bought houses.

* ""We write to disclose tree pruning and cutting work carried out by a third party contractor on behalf of my client and others. The unfortunate decision was carried out in a manner that does not reflect my clients respect for the City or the Parks Department and while he alone was not the only participant, he feels it is appropriate to self-report this matter and work to mitigate any negative consequences.""

Translation: It wasn't only us who did it, so that makes us less guilty, right? I mean, we didn't do it *ourselves*, we just hired others to do it,  so that makes us less guilty, right? And sure, we came up with the idea, paid for the work, and benefited from the entire operation which we carried out, but really, our actions have nothing to do with how green and respectful we truly are. We acted like assholes, but we aren't, we're great, because of this letter.

* ""We believe this work took place on the City-owned parcels near our client's property, who resides on the 3200 block of 35th Avenue SW in West Seattle; Based on a review of online GIS site, we believe the work has affected vegetation and trees on King County Assessor's Tax Parcel Nos. 132403-9099 and 132403-9086, which we understand are owned by the City and managed by Seattle Parks and Recreation.""

Translation: We *believe* the work was done on the days we hired guys who may have affected some trees with their chainsaws, looks like the main effect is it killed them all. And we *believe* the job was finished on the same date which we wrote on the check we paid the lumberjacks with, and we *believe* the address of the clear cutting is right behind our house, yeah, I'm looking out my back window right now and it appears most of the damage was done right between where I'm standing and the skyline view of Seattle. What we do *understand* is that it turns out this is totally not our property, woops, yeah it looks like it was your property all along, which is why we're writing you this letter here.

* ""I am reaching out to you, Mr. Aguirre, because our client wishes to work with Parks to rectify any damage that may have been done to City property in the course of this work.""

Translation: We would be happy to give you guys a little money to make this thing go away, but would really rather not do any jail time or get something on our permanent record or anything like that.

* ""While we do not believe it is possible to replace the trees as they were, my client does wish to assure you that all effort will be made to restore the quality of this site.""

Sadly, you cannot simply glue the fallen trees back to their stumps, I mean, we really hope you can't do that. YOU CAN'T GLUE THE TREES BACK TO THEIR STUMPS, RIGHT?! Anyways, assuming you can't do that, we want to undo everything we just did because we have totally changed our minds, now that our view is amazing we are much happier and agreeable people. How bout some shrubs, everyone loves shrubs!

* ""Because the site is a natural area along a steep slope, we recognize that replanting may be necessary in the near term, as well as longer-term actions ensure establishment of new trees and monitor the condition of the site."" 

Because we are obviously experts on erosion control given the fact that we just cut down 150 mature trees on a steep slope, we are going to go ahead and give you advice on what you should do about this problem we just created for you guys. You guys are really going to want to monitor the condition of the site, hope that helps, just a little knowledge for you guys, don't worry about it, no big deal really, just helping out and admitting guilt and setting things right mm hmm.

* ""Considering this, as well as the Green Seattle Partnership guidelines and expectations for the site, we have already engaged an experienced urban forester to recommend and assist with the implementation of a restoration plan for the site. 

Yo, you know what? We got this, I mean it's good you guys are in the loop with this letter and all, but honestly, don't even worry about it. We got our forester, already hired him, same guy who cut down all the trees so he knows the land and all that. We'll take care of it from here guys, over and out. Monitor the site though there are going to be landslides for sure.

* We will share our forester's restoration plan under separate cover, which will (upon City approval) include a timeline for restoration work, as well as provisions for removal of invasive plants, erosion control measures, the planting of appropriate native species and the development of a plant establishment program to assure survival of the plants on the site. 

Yo we're gonna get rid of those invasive, got the whole plan ready to go did we say ready it's already going, pieces are in motion, this is going to be the best acre ever, as good as before, better than, we got a program in motion, you will be thanking us. We'll take it from here, no need to even reply, we asked the community they say it's cool, ok peace out. Monitor the site though.

"You're misunderstanding how property taxes work in Washington. I'll [repost myself from a few weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/48eb6c/property_taxes_is_there_no_limit/d0jxpca):

All else being equal it doesn't matter how much a property increases in absolute terms. What matters is how much it increases relative to the the rest of the property in the municipality.

In Washington a budget is set by the municipality. The municipality then distributes the burden of that budget across its district based upon the assessed value of the property as a proportion of the total assessed value of all properties in the district.

For example, in Year 1 assume that Machinapolis sets their annual budget at $10,000. The entire city only has two properties, both of which are assessed at being worth $100,000, for a total value of all properties in the city being $200,000. As each house is worth 50% of all property in the city, each owner pays $5,000 in property taxes (50% of the city's set budget).

In Year 2 Machinapolis again sets their operating budget at $10,000. Machinapolis is a wonderful city to raise a family, and as such in Year 2 the two properties in the city increased in value to $150,000 each, for a total value of all properties in the city being $300,000. When it comes time to pay property taxes, each owner again pays based on their ownership of the city's total assessed value. As they both each still own 50% of the total assessed value of all properties, they again each pay 50% of the budget--$5,000. This is despite the increased value of their property because the proportion is the same.

In Year 3 Machinapolis maintains the same $10,000 budget. Property values continue to increase because it's such a wonderful city, so both properties again increased in value. However Property Owner A remodeled their house and added an extension with a new bedroom. Thanks to the newly-remodeled house, Property Owner A's house appreciated faster than the market as a whole. His house jumped up from $150,000 to $250,000. Property Owner B's house appreciated at the normal market rate to $200,000 because the market is still hot, but he didn't remodel like A did.

Now the total value of all property in Machinapolis is $450,000. Owner A owns 56% of all assessed value of property in the city while Owner B owns 44% of all assessed value. As such, Owner A will be responsible for 56% of the previously-set budget, or $5,600. Owner B will be responsible for 44% of the budget, or $4,400.

**Even though both properties INCREASED in value in Year 3, Owner B's property tax bill DECREASED because their property increased slower in relation to the total property values in the city.**

This is the basic model of how property tax works across the state. **The total inflation of property values in irrelevant**. The only aspect that matters is the **proportional** increase in property values.",,,,shoeson,,,1458151222,t5_2qhad,t3_4anzpb,t1_d127231,12,1460686144,0,0,d1286gs,Seattle,12,,

"For people moving here from less transit-friendly places it really is a lifestyle change to use transit.  Many of the complaints I hear about the transit system from new users boil down to the same problem- they're trying to use a bus/train/cycling/walking the same way they used a car with no change to their lifestyle.


No, it's not convenient to make a single bi-weekly trip to Costco for all your groceries via bus.  Yeah, it's a pain to ride a bike with all your kid's hockey gear.  Yes, it does suck to wait in the rain half an hour for the next bus because you just missed the previous one.


That doesn't mean that transit sucks, though.  It means that it sucks to expect transit to work exactly like driving a single occupant vehicle.  Maybe you make more small trips to the store more frequently (mmm freshly baked bread) or have groceries delivered.  Maybe you get a locker to keep your hockey gear where you practice.  Maybe you duck into a coffee shop to wait for the bus if it's raining, or take a slightly longer route on a bus that's coming sooner.

"Bernie is going to have to work with the same Congress that Obama had, and I'm not sure how he'll do getting his agenda through if he doesn't adapt similar to how Obama had to.

I mean, he has been a pretty successful President in my opinion. The economy has improved significantly under his administration and has actually recovered better than just about any other country from the recession, he's managed to appoint two SC justices (which ultimately led to the nationwide legalization of gay marriage), managed to do what was considered almost impossible and get a healthcare reform through (which is obviously not perfect, but had many important improvements and can be built upon in the future), Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform, the Iran nuclear deal, opened the Cuban embassy, managed to lead climate change talks leading to the Paris Climate Accords, managed to give the order to take out Bin Laden, and has been a pretty steady hand when it comes to navigating the various conflicts that have been popping up around the world without getti.

"I have some problems with this whole situation. Is the guy sleazy, fuck yea. Did he do anything illegal, i don't think so. He is being charged with attempted rape. I think of when people are charged with attempted murder. That charge happens because the person tries to murder someone and fails. But the person had every intention to murder. In this case, the guy thought about raping her, and even took some steps to make it possible, but then he decided not to. He did not fail to do it. There was not some situation that prevented him from doing it. He just did not do it. Is it illegal to not rape someone?

My other issue is with the concept of drunk rape. When a parson drives drunk, the person is responsible for his/her actions. If someone has sex while drunk is he/she not responsible for agreeing to it? If not, then why is that different?
I do see a different case if the person is passed out while drunk. In that case the person could not possibly get in a car and drive, just as the person could not possible agree to sex. In that case, yes it would be rape. No question. However, the article did not say that she was passed out drunk.

"When you cut funding to shelters (which they have, I do believe a few years back), close shelters, soup kitchens, and vital resources where the homeless can seek shelter and regroup they are left with little they can do for themselves. When a shelter closes the people who normally go to it at night are left to wander, some camp out under a stoop, some move on, after time the ones left see pitching a tent with other homeless people their only options for safety and a bit of community. If they don't have trash cans near it gets dumped, they don't have toilets near they go outside, it's a never ending cycle. If the city would only offer more shelter in way of proper shelters with a staff who can determine mental illness (and get those people help), addiction (and get those people help of they're willing), job training, mailboxes for those who are trying to get a job and off the streets, family shelters to allow a family to stay together at night, etc I could see the homeless population drop and productive people walking out of those places. I'm not sure how much something like that would cost, but I'm sure the million from the Pronto project would have helped keep a shelter going for a while. Maybe I dream big about helping them, but if it was any of us out there we would want help getting the hell off the streets as fast we we could.",,,,Argyleskin,Queen Anne,,1458062294,t5_2qhad,t3_4aj6ci,t3_4aj6ci,12,1460661893,0,0,d10tg3k,Seattle,12,,flair
The last four stations that flipped in January were all owned by the same company (IHeartMedia). The ratings on their key stations were slipping and they needed to re-tool in hopes to better target their younger audience.

"I'm going to be honest and say that this is why I moved to Seattle and I think it's been a huge benefit to the city.

I'm probably in either the lower end of the 1% or higher end of 2% of average income, but I chose to move here in large part for the very low tax burden on high earners compared to where I lived before (NYC, which has both city and state income tax).

While I'm here, I also employ a dog walker (part-time), cleaning lady (part-time), nanny for the kids (full time), and pay them all above average wages plus bonuses. My family also spends about $10k per month on lifestyle expenses like groceries, restaurants (we are good tippers), hobbies, and other activities, and pay 9.5% sales tax on this (which I happily deduct from income for federal tax). We've bought all of our cars from Seattle area dealers and used local labor for home renovations.

There are thousands of people like me and more coming in all the time. Yes, we have driven up the home prices in desirable areas, but if I were a Seattle or WA policymaker I would be very reluctant to take away the tax advantage of living in WA state. I could live anywhere in my line of work and if I had to pay 10% of my income to the state, Austin, TX would suddenly look very attractive.",,,,jimdog,,,1458883974,t5_2qhad,t3_4bsiak,t1_d1c5nrr,13,1460868240,0,0,d1crd76,Seattle,13,,

As far as the utility being incompetent, the issues in this area go beyond those down south.  Up here, they can't just go tearing out trees which may threaten infrastructure.  Down in hurricane territory, that isn't the case.  They can tear out the things that are a problem.  They also have more underground utilities than we do up here simply because of the increased risk.

As far as a monopoly, there are certain things that don't really do well with competition.  Electricity provisioning is one of those things.

"How are any of those statements racist? The first one sounds like a joke considering his daughter, son in law, grandchildren, and daughter in law are all Jewish. Let's not forget when Donald opened his club in Palm Beach called Mar-a-Lago in the 90s, he insisted on accepting Jews and blacks even though other clubs in Palm Beach to this day discriminate against blacks and Jews.

"I see you read that article too.

While Hitler comparisons are old-hat at this point, there are parallels between Weimar Germany and the current US. Not enough to be foreboding, but enough to be instructive. 

A lot of conservative Germans who were fond of the Reich and Wilhelmine/Bismarckian Germany ascribed to the ""stabbed in the back"" theory of Germany's WWI loss. This was a sort of amorphous conspiracy theory, but generally it held that elites, especially the Jews, had sabotaged Germany during the war (and  after). This bears a resemblance to the rhetoric bouncing around conservative circles in recent years - Obama is a secret muslim interloper who's going to deliver the US to its enemies, ""SJWs"" are a powerful corrupting force in Unis and making the new generation soft, immigrants and especially muslims are taking the country from its rightful white christian inhabitants. It goes on, but you get the gist. The growing militia movement (you know, the one that includes the bird sanctuary invaders) also mirrors some of the Weimar Republic's political militia movement.

None of this is particularly unique, it's all happened before Germany after WWI and after without anyone like Hitler or Mussolini coming to power. But, of all the recent US politicians and political climate that have be subjected to the ""literally Hitler"" treatment, I think there's more application towards the current state of the rightwing fringe and Mr. Trump.

"It's worth pointing out that Pronto isn't exactly carbon-free:  they expend quite a bit of fuel rebalancing bikes from station to station.  

That metric is one of the questions City Council wanted an answer to, but as of February 23, SDOT didn't have the data available yet.  So it's unclear if Pronto is actually reducing carbon emissions in Seattle due to low ridership.

In Minneapolis, though, rebalancing vehicles used about 26 tons of CO2 per year, to avoid private car trips totaling around 30-45 tons of CO2.  A nice reduction and improvement to traffic flow, but not as dramatic as you might expect.  The bikes certainly aren't ""zero emission"" by any stretch like a privately owned bicycle would be.

Interestingly, in places where there's better transit infrastructure, bike share actually makes things worse:  in London, the rebalancing van trips are far more costly in carbon than the alternatives:  private cars are uncommon and people would tend to ride the Underground instead, which is very efficient per passenger mile.

"**TL;DR:** ST3 is happening because transit activists wanted high capacity, grade-separated transit in Seattle from Lake City to Ballard via Northgate, Ballard to UW, Ballard to Downtown, White Center to Alaska Junction, Alaska Junction to Downtown, along the Aurora Ave Corridor, and along the Duwamish valley corridor. Now that it's actually happening, the suburbs are getting nearly everything and only 2 of the 7 lines from the original vision are included. 4.5 years of the ""Seattle Process"" is frustrating.

I find this whole process quite ironic. 4.5 years ago, local activist Ben Schiendelman started Seattle Subway with [this blog post](http://seattletransitblog.com/2011/11/23/lets-build-a-seattle-subway/). His goal was to force Sound Transit to think beyond ST2 and come up with an expansion plan to take to the voters. He accomplished this goal once Sound Transit committed to working on ST3 in 2013, at which point he left the organization. Since then, other transit activists have taken over Seattle Subway and altered Ben's original vision, to [this](http://seattletransitblog.com/2014/07/24/summary-post/) and then [this](http://www.seattlesubway.org/region.pdf). Whether you agree with Ben's original vision or Seattle Subway's latest version, there are some common elements: the Lake City to Ballard via Northgate line, the Ballard to UW line, the Ballard to Downtown line, the White Center to Alaska Junction line, the Alaska Junction to Downtown line, and the express line to Sea-Tac via the Duwamish valley. These are the core corridors that are needed for a complete system. All but two of those lines are missing from this $50 billion draft package. 

I'm willing to accept that 3 of the 7 lines from Ben's original vision didn't make the cut as candidate projects (Aurora, Lake City to Ballard via Northgate, and Duwamish express), but the 4 that did make the cut need to be included. They're the main reason this package was built in the first place. 

It's so like Seattle to go from building a complete rapid transit system for the densest parts of our region to building park and rides, bus rapid transit, and light rail lines for suburbs that don't really need it in order to try and please everyone. We need to remember the whole reason this effort came to be: Seattle's densest neighborhoods need grade-separated transit. For a $50 billion, 25-year project, we should be able to get at least that.",,,,SeattleDave0,Madison Valley,,1459364542,t5_2qhad,t3_4cl53t,t3_4cl53t,49,1460983209,0,0,d1jfdy1,Seattle,49,,flair

"I'll throw in my anecdotal two cents. I used to work with the area homeless population everyday in the transit system and got to know quite a few. Most of the chronically homeless population were not from the Seattle area, or even Washington. It was clear they moved up to Seattle because the services, both public and private, were better. In Seattle it was clear that they felt the police and transit security were more hands off than most places and that the panhandling was better. Seattle has become a destination point for the chronically homeless. There's quite a significant body of evidence that this is happening in places like [San Francisco](http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/SAN-FRANCISCO-City-attracts-homeless-for-more-2606318.php) for the same reasons.

"**TLDR - Today I learned more about voting in Washington State**

I clicked on the www.wsrp.org link to see who the Republican Party in Washington has nominated.  It looks like there was no Caucus on Feb 20th.  The Republican Party in Washington State uses the results of the May 24th Presidential Primary to award delegates.  They have moved beyond the backwards Caucus, where only 7% of people vote and instead use the Primary where 42% of people vote.

For the past 20 years the Presidential Primary was moved from May to Feb/March, to make it earlier and more relevant.  But this year the Democrats blocked the measure that would have moved it to March 8th.

**Republican explanation of the Presidential Primary being moved**
&gt;The polls close in a couple of hours here in Washington, and at 8:15 pm tonight the first results of the Washington State Presidential Primary will be reported…

&gt;OOPS!  Actually, thanks to the State Democrats, our GOP Presidential Primary is NOT today!  But it should have been!

&gt;While state law sets the primary in May, the law also allows us to move the primary and we’ve moved it to February or March every year since 1996.

&gt;Last year, Secretary of State Kim Wyman pushed legislation that would have moved the primary up to March 8th – that’s today!  But in Olympia, the House Democrats blocked that effort.

&gt;Then, Secretary Wyman convened a meeting of a special committee, composed of Democrats and Republicans, to move the primary to March 8th.  Once again, the Democrats were obstructionists, as every Democrat on the committee voted against an earlier primary.

&gt;Why are the Democrats such bullies?  Because the Presidential Primary gives every voter a voice.  Democrats will only use results from their caucus – a tiny percentage of the statewide vote.  (Don’t you think the Democrats should change their name?)

&gt;Don’t worry, Republicans will have the last word!  Thanks to this year’s exciting GOP presidential race, the Democrats’ hope for a meaningless May Primary couldn’t be further from reality.   

&gt;Four candidates, and a highly competitive race, mean our state will be at the center of the action in May.  We expect national media attention and campaigning by presidential candidates as our May 24th Primary approaches.  Go GOP! 

**Former Secretary of State Sam Reed on our state’s presidential nomination process, published as an op ed in The Olympian**

&gt;PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION NEEDS INCLUSIVE PROCESS
&gt;* Washington Republicans held precinct caucuses Saturday to start the process
&gt;* But the GOP is using a statewide primary vote May 24 to award delegates to candidates
&gt;* By contrast, Democrats are awarding delegates only through caucuses March 26

&gt;by Sam Reed – February 21, 2016

&gt;“Throughout 240 years of our nation’s history, nothing politically is more important to Americans than who is elected president.

&gt;“With the Republican Party political caucuses Saturday, the Democrats’ caucuses coming up on March 26 and the Washington presidential primary coming up May 24, I want to talk with you about how we nominate candidates for president.

&gt;“While our state is nationally recognized for being on the cutting edge of reforming the election system to have more inclusive, informed and accessible voting, this is an appalling exception.

&gt;“The United States has a decentralized system of elections. Each state decides how it is going to carry out the presidential nominating process. Over the past half century, most states have reformed their process to move away from the archaic political party caucus system to letting the people have a direct, secret vote in presidential primaries.

&gt;“Washington did this in 1989. A popular initiative to the Legislature, with unprecedented grassroots support, was adopted overwhelmingly by the Legislature.

&gt;“There were compelling reasons behind this reform.

&gt;“Political parties’ caucuses are 19th century creatures from the smoke-filled-room era of party bosses. They are premised on the idea that party insiders gather in precinct caucuses, then county and state conventions to elect delegates. It is very easy for party leaders or presidential campaigns to manipulate the caucuses and conventions.

&gt;“These are exclusive processes. In terms of the caucus system in presidential years, by far the most money, time, talent and candidate availability goes into the Iowa caucuses. Yet, this year the voter turnout was a paltry 15.7 percent. A couple weeks later, the New Hampshire presidential primary was held and 62.2 percent of their voters participated. That is an extraordinary difference.

&gt;“In Washington, our party caucuses average 7 percent turnout, while our presidential primary averages 42 percent turnout.

&gt;“You’re probably wondering why caucus turnout is so low. First, you have to show up at one time on one day to participate. That automatically eliminates sizable portions of our population who are working, out of town, serving in the military, working or traveling overseas and ill, or taking care of sick children.

&gt;“Second, there are people who feel uncomfortable arguing or even politely discussing their presidential preferences with people in their neighborhoods. This is particularly true for people with English as a second language and people with disabilities. Most people simply feel that it’s none of their neighbors’ business whom they support.

&gt;“On the other hand, presidential primaries are conducted like any other election – other than having to pick a Democratic or Republican ballot. The ballots are mailed out 20 days before the election. Voters can mail them or use drop boxes at any time. They vote a secret ballot in private. They can take their time and study the candidates.

&gt;“And now the bad news.

&gt;“As your longtime Thurston County auditor and secretary of state for 12 years, I was deeply disappointed — perhaps even shocked — how the political parties decided to ignore the will of the people and their elected representatives.

&gt;“With the Republicans, it was usually partial ignoring. They decided to honor the presidential primary by determining 50 percent of the delegates most presidential years. This year, state GOP chair Susan Hutchison deserves considerable credit and commendation for leading her party to accept the presidential primary results for determining 100 percent of their delegates to the national convention.

&gt;“The Democrats, on the other hand, have never honored the vote of the people. As far as I know, there is no other state in the nation where a political party chooses to ignore the people’s vote and uses the more exclusive caucus/convention system to determine whom their delegates support at the national convention. In my opinion, that’s an atrocity. If you are a Democrat, you need to speak up.

&gt;“To compound the problem, this year the Democrats, for the first time, also decided to make Washingtonians’ votes less meaningful by not moving the presidential primary up on the election calendar.

&gt;“For 240 years, we have been the world’s great success story for representative democracy. Let’s move forward in this state and allow that democracy to work in an unfettered fashion for the presidential nominating process.”

"I was looking for a home. I had the option of buying a cookie cutter house in some cookie cutter neighborhood like Sammamish, or a condo (with looming special assessments), or an actual house remodeled from an older home that was within my budget, but just a little further out so I have to adjust my hours on the commute. I went with the final option. I also went through several offers before I found a house, and it's not going to get any better for buyers out here. 

Buyers have few options with a reasonable budget simply because they keep building these overpriced cookie cutter houses that look exactly the same as every other house, and all of them start at the 500s. I'm looking at you Toll Brothers. And there aren't enough houses being built or remodeled which are within the budgets of most people. So those who are poor either get priced out of their homes, or into cheap condos. And good luck finding a cheap condo and getting an offer accepted because most of the time it's bought out by the rich to rent to the middle class.

I'm lucky I have a house now, but I know a lot of people who are looking and are out of luck with almost every offer they make. And, I don't see anything in the foreseeable future to alleviate the housing problem here because nobody is really bothering to make a massive amount of affordable housing in reasonable areas.",,,,mesoscalevortex,,,1459229257,t5_2qhad,t3_4cdn0g,t3_4cdn0g,17,1460947539,0,0,d1hcuo1,Seattle,17,,

"Its not really a slimjim or hotwire that makes first/second gen legacies and first gen impreza's easy to steal, its whats called 'jiggler keys'. If you've ever seen a police video of how a slimjim works, its a fairly delicate procedure, and you have to walk around with the slimjim itself which can be long and obvious looking. Hotwiring involves ripping the lower and/or upper steering wheel shroud off to access the ignition wiring. On these model subaru's that plastic is very thick and even with the steering wheel completely off, its difficult. Easier on older model american cars but 90's era american and foreign cars took some precautions in this regard to prevent it.

The jiggler key, as the cops call it, involves just a random car key of varying length which the thieves then shave down to make it fit in other makes and models of cars, specifically older 80's and 90's cars. The ignition and drivers side lock tumblers of these cars are usually somewhat worn down with use over the years and can be made to 'click' into the lock cylinder. Thats what this guy looks like he's doing, because all it involves is walking up to the car, and inserting a seemingly normal looking key and just playing with it for a min, just like how a normal person would unlock the car. 

The only way to mitigate this would be to get one of those steering wheel lock bar thingys, [like this one](http://www.amazon.com/Club-1000-Original-Steering-Wheel/dp/B0000CBILL). Alternatively you could wire up some hidden fuel delivery cut off switch underneath the front drivers seat that you have to switch on before starting the car. You could have that wired to your fuel pump.

You have this thing called an adrenal gland that releases stuff called adrenaline. This adrenaline heightens all of your senses and improves your situational analysis. The man with the gun likely had adrenaline going through his body and he made the decision to fight instead of flee. He very likely saved an innocent persons life, possibly more than one person.

"We are only getting one chance to build light rail between now and 2041, so lets get the entire thing right.

ST4 won't be able to ask for authorization most likely until around 2036 and would likely have first projects opening in 2046.  That is a very long time, that package will need to solve mid-century transit problems, not patch missed links from 2016.

This package has 25 years tied to it.  We should only be approving something that long if it will build out the entire system as we think is necessary today.  ST3 doesn't meet that goal.

It is lacking a Ballard-UW line.  It has no line across 520, or down 405.  We need one of them or light rail is useless to Everett folks working on the Eastside, since they have to go downtown and then out I-90 to use light rail.  The Ballard line should probably be connecting to the main line up towards Lynnwood, so there is a parallel route along 99 by the time 2041 comes along.

So I'm voting No, so we get a chance to try and vote to do it right in 2018 or 2020.  If ST3 was going to build all this in 15 years, it might be something, 25 is too long for an incomplete system.",,,,TheElSean,,,1459288300,t5_2qhad,t3_4ch5ui,t1_d1i7rj7,20,1460963128,0,0,d1i9jks,Seattle,20,,

"There appears to be a lot of confusion as to how the system actually works. Allow me to clarify. I am a firearms dealer.

A denial does not usually mean that a criminal is trying to buy a gun. In my practice (mostly before our Aurora location opened, as you will see below, mistaken identity cases are essentially no longer being processed by NICS), 2/3 or all denials were the case of mistaken identity. When NICS does the background check, they have your biometrics as reported by the Form 4473 data, name, birthday, etc. If you have a sufficiently common name, a sufficiently common appearance, and were born in a big city, the probability of matching a criminal appears to be rather high. Then you get DENIED.

What follows is a lengthy process of duking it out with FBI where you submit your fingerprints, they get matched against these of the criminals, and then you get your gun - and sometimes a special number (UPIN) which prevents these things in the future.

Unfortunately, the current backlog at FBI means that they are processing appeals from June 2015, and UPIN requests from January 2015 (https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/nics/appeals/nics-appeals-process/appeals-home). This means that - especially for private sellers - appealing the DENIAL is no longer practical. No one will keep a firearm for a buyer for a year while that person is going through the process.

By the way, denials are very, very rare. In one year of operation in Seattle (we have since moved to Lynnwood because of the gun tax) we have processes roughly 3500 guns. We had 9 denials. This is just from the data at my fingertips.

Majority of them, as I said before, are probably the cases of mistaken identity. The ones that aren't are typically for the offenses that a person have either forgotten, or did not know that they would disqualify them from ever owning a gun. Specifically, the law says that the offence has to be a felony which carries a maximum term of over one year. You don't have to actually serve any time to fall under this definition - it's all about maximum possible term, not what you get. Other cases involved an anger management class in the past etc. The dealer doesn't really know - NICS doesn't tell us, so this is all from what the customers say (as in - explaining the denial to the customer, we would mention this as a possibility, and they would go ""Oh yeah... I did have an anger management class..."").

This is the reason no one wants to investigate, let alone prosecute these cases - the probability that it was actually a criminal trying to deliberately buy a gun by lying on the form is essentially zero. Criminals do know that they will be denied, so they don't go to the store. There is so much firearms already on the black market, they will serve the need of the criminal community for hundreds of years to come.",,,,preciseshooter,,,1459219987,t5_2qhad,t3_4cbsrv,t3_4cbsrv,47,1460945235,0,0,d1h7yra,Seattle,47,,

"I was friends with a guy in high school that used to get picked on a little bit, but not a lot. More than anything he just couldn't take a joke and people knew that so they enjoyed making him angry. 

He started taking sterioids at some point and worked out til he'd doubled his weight. Now when someone poked fun at him he'd threaten to kick their ass. If he airballed a shot during a pickup game He'd quickly glare at everyone present as if daring them to laugh. Usually somebody would because people still didn't take him seriously. That's where he'd remind them he can kick their ass. And that's where people would laugh harder

A few years later he gets really into guns. He's posting pictures of guns that he wants to buy or videos of people firing guns. He'd post links to articles about someone being jumped but defending themself with a gun. He was basically saying ""You guys better respect me because I'm into guns now. Who's to say I don't own one?""

I stayed friendly with the guy for old times' sake. He was one of those friends I'd only hear from when shit wasn't going well for him. We'd go out and get a consolation beer. It was mostly a pity thing. Our 'friendship' balanced on a thread

One day he invites me over to his house. We've never hung out at his house before and we've never hung out without a preface of there being something that he's upset about. I go over unsure of what I'm walking into. Not 5 minutes after showing up he points at something on the wall and tells me to look at it. I look.. I see nothing... I turn back to ask what he's talking about and he has a pistol pointed at me. He pulls the trigger and it clicks because it was empty.

I had jumped about 6 feet and fallen back over an ottoman. He laughed his head off. I stood up, debated beating the utter shit out of him for like three seconds, then just said ""you're a fucking idiot"", left, and never talked to him again.

"&gt; How would an inspector find things like the leaks in the plumbing when they are behind the walls and could not even be visible at that time?

They wouldn't, and even if they did unless a home is brand new from a builder, there is not an implied warranty, or level of work standard. Its perfectly within code and legal for a homeowner to do their own substandard ""repairs.""

If you were seeking a legal remedy, you would have to prove that the homeowner knowingly did work that would cause issues, which is nearly impossible.

&gt; I thought having multiple contractors who have come in and taken photos and can verify that work performed prior to us moving in was not done to standard could be evidence for actionable loss? 

Nope, because that's their opinion, plus unless you have receipts and can drag in all the contractors involved, past and your new ones, how are you going to prove who, again, knowingly did substandard work?

&gt; Have never had to deal with a lawsuit either way (giving or receiving) so I would not know if that is even presentable, admissible, anything. 

Its not, like I said, there is no implied warranty on a house, unless its offered, either from a new builder, or a third party that sells you one. An option it looks like you chose not to explore.

&gt; From what I remember when I purchased the house they were required to note anything that was repaired, changed, adjusted, etc. (e.g. when I sold my house in California before moving up here I had to document changes to plumbing, flooring, etc I had made).

* Until you get into the mountains, you don't get nearly the same level of mosquitos and flies that also contribute to miserable times outdoors in the Midwest and South.
* Loooooooong days compared to most of the rest of the West that also doesn't suffer from humidity and bug problems. On July 4th this year, the sun will rise at 5:18am and won't set until 9:09pm.
* People's behavior in the PNW experiences bigger swings compared to other regions I've spent a lot of time in. In the winter, everyone is heads-down, ""fuck you"", loathe to make friends.

"This article is garbage. 

&gt;As of January, a one-bedroom apartment in the city averaged $1,660 per month

First of all, why are we comparing **average** rents with someone on the **minimum** wage? Second, it's perfectly reasonable to expect someone living on minimum wage to live with some roommates. I did this for 3 years when I was starting my full-time working adult life and loved the instant social life that came along with it (I actually met my wife this way). Craigslist currently shows [over 200 listings](http://seattle.craigslist.org/search/see/roo?max_price=850) of rooms for rent in Seattle city limits for under $850 per month, which would be affordable for someone working full-time at $15/hr. But fine, let's say that this hypothetical person living on minimum wage absolutely must live alone in Seattle City Limits in an average quality, 1 bedroom apartment at the average going rate. They could move to [North Seattle](http://kuow.org/post/rent-too-high-compare-seattle-s-neighborhoods#north), where average rent was $1,020 per month as of the end of 2014, or [Beacon Hill](http://kuow.org/post/rent-too-high-compare-seattle-s-neighborhoods#beacon) for $1,055 per month, or [Rainier Valley](http://kuow.org/post/rent-too-high-compare-seattle-s-neighborhoods#rainier) for $1,042 per month. 

&gt;Moving on.
&gt;
&gt;Other costs of living in Seattle are high, too. Using Numbeo's cost of living estimator, we come up with a cost of $965 per month for a single person, before rent.

Hmm... let's actually go to Numeo and see how they come up with that number. What happens if I change the settings. Instead of ""choosing inexpensive restaurants"" 50% of the time, let's change that to 100%. ""Drinking Coffee outside of your home""? Let's change that from ""moderate"" to ""no"". ""Going out"" can be changed from once a week to twice per month. Let's also change ""sport memberships"" from yes to no and ""Buying Clothing and Shoes"" from moderate to low. Low and behold, that $965 per month figure turns into $760 per month. 

$850 per month rent for your room + $760 per month = $1,610 per month. $1,610 per month x 12 months = $19,320 per year. 

&gt;Assuming our minimum-wage-earning Seattleite is a law-abiding taxpayer, they'll lose about 13 percent of their income to taxes, leaving just $27,174 in their pockets.

Wow, look at that! Someone working full-time making $15 per hour would have a take home pay of $27,174 per year. After making a few lifestyle adjustments it costs $19,320 per year to live in the city, leaving $7,854 per year to pay down debt and/or save up for an emergency fund, down payment for a house, college tuition, etc. Apparently it is affordable to live in Seattle on $15 per hour! Even if this hypothetical minimum-wage earner decided to live alone in an average quality, 1 bedroom apartment in North Seattle, that's still only $21,360 per year ($1,020 + $760 = $1,780 per month, $1,780 x 12 = $21,360 per year), leaving $5,814 per year for savings and/or paying debt.

EDIT: By the way, $19,320 per year / 52 weeks / 40 hours per week = $9.29 per hour, which is 2% **less than** the **state minimum wage**. ",,,,SeattleDave0,Madison Valley,,1458592172,t5_2qhad,t3_4bc1dj,t3_4bc1dj,11,1460791014,0,0,d18a8lj,Seattle,11,,flair

"Note: this is not a pro-Hillary comment, this is a comment to clear the air about these talks from someone who works in corporate events.

So, regarding these kinds of speeches: I work in live corporate events. I've been doing in for 13 years. I travel all over the country doing it, do it at very high level, and have seen many very well known celebrities and politicians (as well as lesser known celebrities and politicians) speak. I've seen Hillary speak before. 

When it's a mid level celebrity, they're typically soliciting the conference to talk, charging in the $10-50k range, and tailor their talks to the company they're presenting to so that it provides some value. 

When you have a very high level presenter, like a former president or a major CEO, they're actively courted by the company holding the conference, they charge insane amounts of money (or do it for free for an organization they believe in or for publicity.) But what's more, they talk about whatever the hell they feel like. For example, Neil DeGrass Tyson has spoken at the Tableau conference two years in a row, and he just talks about cool science shit for a while. I saw George W Bush speak at a meeting for a prominent financial company once, and the only thing he said about money was ""I don't think you want my financial advice.""

When I saw Hillary speak, she just talked about her time in the Senate, various issues in the world, and what she thought was happening in the U.S. She did not say anything tailored to the company that paid her to be there.

She was not yet running for president officially (pre-Obama), and he was not on teleprompter. To get the transcripts from those events, people from her campaign would have to contact the company, have them pull up the archival footage (if they kept it, a lot of times they'll only store it for a year or two,) and then get it transcribed. That can take a long time, or the company might not be willing to release the transcripts themselves because they don't want to be associated with the political fallout.

I can guarantee that she has said something in years of giving talks that would be able to be used against her, because if anyone gives enough talks over a number of years you can misrepresent them--that's what happens to every political candidate ever. So if it's even possible to get the transcripts, I can understand why she wouldn't want to release them.

Anyway, bottom line is this: Goldman Sachs only pays Hillary $250,000 per speech because she wouldn't be willing to take the gig otherwise (and it's pocket change to them,) and they just want a big name speaker for their event. They'll pay $250,000 to anyone who makes their boring financial conference interesting, and I hope companies keep doing it because otherwise my job is going to suck.

The reason that Bernie Sanders hasn't done these kind of paid speaking gigs is because until he ran for president, he wasn't a big enough name to draw that kind of money. If he doesn't win the election, you better believe he'll be getting phone calls to do talks for big money. Maybe he'll take it, maybe he won't. But he'll be invited.

"For those quoting the 25,000 number as the number of caucus goers statewide, let's do an ELI5 of the Washington State Democratic Party caucus system.

Everyone is in a specific legislative district, which are used to vote for our state legislators. I'm in the 46th, for example. We are further divided in to precincts. If you live in King County, you can find your precinct online [here](http://www.kingcounty.gov/depts/elections/elections/maps.aspx). Each precinct can elect a certain number of delegates, depending on the ~~population of that precinct~~ number of votes for Obama in the 2012 election; one delegate for every 75 votes. The registered voters who show up (or submit a proper absentee ballot) vote, a number of delegates for each candidate are assigned based on the proportion each candidate receives of the total precinct vote, and those delegates are selected from each candidates supporters by those supporters. 

Again, as an example, my precinct had about fifty people show up, and 3 delegates to assign. There were ten other precincts meeting at the same time, and we were one of the small ones.  

That is what happened yesterday, and that 25,000 number is, to be clear, the number of precinct delegates pledged to Sanders and Clinton respectively. Many more people showed up for each precinct meeting, to elect those 25,000 precinct delegates. They will go on to legislative district and county caucuses, though some parts of the state don't hold legislative district caucuses. Regardless, the 25,000 number will come down as specific delegates from each district and/or county are elected to go on to the Congressional district caucus. Those delegates will again run to be a state level delegate, and so from these 25,000 delegates, 67 will eventually become some of the 101 pledged state delegates that go to the National Convention at ~~Charlotte~~ Philadelphia. Twelve others are selected at the state level convention from party leaders, and the remaining 22 are ""at-large"" candidates, selected from among those party members who submit their candidacy to the state party by June 10.

It's a big, stupid, complicated system, but, yeah, that's how the sausage gets made.

EDIT: My mistake. The 2012 Democratic National Convention was held in Charlotte. The 2016 convention will be held in Philly.

EDIT 2: As pointed out elsewhere, the number of delegates for a given precinct isn't based on precinct population so much as voter participation from party members in that precinct.",,,,HorseLawyer,Haller Lake,,1459092326,t5_2qhad,t3_4c40ve,t3_4c40ve,29,1460911819,0,0,d1fa9qr,Seattle,29,,flair

"Hang out at coffee shops. Try to stay there as long as you can, even if every fiber of your body tells you to go home and get on the internet. Leave your phone at home a few times. Don't wear headphones in public. Bring a book so you don't feel weird just being there.

The key is to talk to as many random stranger as you come across. Keep it simple. Say obvious things about them or the situation, so it doesn't seem personal.

From the coffee shops, you can move onto the mall, parks, bookstores, etc.

Vary the locations that you hit up as much as possible. Don't go to the same place more than once or twice a week.

Talk to the baristas and servers. Ask them what's good. Get to know them by name.

When you talk to people, most will show LOW interest. DO NOT BLAME YOURSELF OR THEM FOR IT. It's not due to any social skill. Don't blame it on the Seattle freeze or whatever. Why is obvious but I'll explain anyway. If you blame yourself or others, you stop trying. You've effectively surrendered your initiative and responsibilities. Don't fall into this trap.

The people that show high interest in talking to you, don't rush to exchange contact info right away. This might turn it into an obligation. Mentally note when/where you met them and you'll probably see them again at the same time next week.

Get involved in physical activities, it's much easier to meet new people when you're doing things with them. Some have mentioned that meetup website. That's probably a good start but you probably want to move away from it once you get going. Don't become dependent on it.

Organize events once you've met a few people with similar interest. It's much easier to tell people to go do something with you than just go hang out or get dinner. Let your minions introduce people to you. People always want to meet the organizer for some reason.

You must be able to blurt! Say the stupidest thing that comes across your head. Don't hold back anything. You can always apologize or mitigate it if you've offended someone. The greater the risk, the greater the reward.

"&gt;buyers have few options within a reasonable budget because they keep building these overpriced cookie cutter houses 

I agree these houses suck, but you are misunderstanding supply and demand. They aren't ""building houses that start in the 500s,"" they are building houses that sell at *market rate.* The developer doesn't decide the house's value, the market does that. Market rate is set by supply and demand. 

The fact that they are building large numbers of houses is actually helping keep prices down, as hard as that is to believe. The problem though, is that the demand is huge, massive, crazy, insatiable. People want to live here, and they will pay whatever it takes to outbid the next guy so long as they can afford it. If you want to be mad at anyone, be mad at the tech industry for being so successful and bringing in all these people that need a place to live. 

As terrible as it seems, there is a good argument to be made saying that the solution to our housing problems is more, denser development. If we could just make more units closer together, we'd finally be able to satisfy the demand and prices would level off. 

Some people believe we should eliminate all requirements for parking spots to be built in apartment buildings, for example. Use all the space to cram more units in. Developers win (they get rent out more units), and renters win (better supply in market = lower rent).

Seattle is one of the richest cities in the country, in one of the richest areas. Just look at the dramatic increase in building construction and property prices across the region.

"I've been working on subarus for about 10 years, and unfortunately they're stupidly easy to steal If you know what you're doing. 

For example, a large majority of Subaru keys will work with other Subarus because there are only a certain amount of master variants. The key for my 92 legacy works to start my dad's 05 forester, and I have a key to one of my older cars that will unlock (but not start) my brothers 02 legacy. 

Also, for all early subarus (90-05ish legacy, 93-07 Impreza/wrx, 98-05ish forester, even the damn SVX), the window is what seals to the rubber at the top of the door. It's not like other cars where there is an actual door frame goes all the way around the window. This makes it incredibly easy to stick something between the frame and the window to wedge it open and then stick something in to press the door unlock switch.

"I'm from California and moved to Chicago in my mid-twenties back in 2006. I lived in Wicker Park and Logan Square for about 3 years, met my wife and talked her into moving back to the west coast. We ended up in Seattle proper and we love it. 

I'll always have a fondness in my heart for Chicago, especially as someone who came from California where we only have two seasons and really eclectic cultures (helps to be on the coast). But as a cyclist who rides year round and loves mountains, I got real sick of black snow, flat urban sprawl and the really fucked up racial tension in Chicago. Plus I really don't like all the yellow brick. I've come to learn that Chicago is a better place to visit as a former resident than it is to live there unless you're a millionaire. I love my Chicago friends like family, I've yet to find friends in Seattle that I feel as comfortable around, and friends I've made here who are from the mid-west are of like mind.

Because of traffic and the unique geographical qualities of the area, 30 minutes north of **downtown** Seattle is only 5 miles, however. 30 minutes north of the city limits is super quiet and can be a little rednecky and methy, but its still lightyears better than 30 minutes south of Chicago, hell its better than 30 minutes north of Chicago too with all the pricks in Evanston for example (sweeping generalization).

Although, I really miss beautiful spring and fall weather in Chicago and being able to wear shorts and a t-shirt 24 hours a day with random rain showers. You have to bundle up a little when you live near the coast, it gets chilly at night. But you'll just laugh when you experience ""chilly"" here in Seattle. It's nothing. Theres no humidity in the summer, although its humid in the winter which makes the air feel extra cold, but again you'll just laugh when you see people wearing puffy jackets in 60f weather.

Same with the traffic. You can tell who hasn't ever lived away from Seattle by how much they complain about it. So much better than Chicago.

Its fucking beautiful here. Theres a little bit of crime, mostly car theft and home burglary it seems, the occasional hate crime downtown on Friday nights when the rednecks get their redbull and vodka. There is some gang activity in the south. Out in the sticks you'll see raised trucks flying confederate flags. It's amusing. They wouldn't last a day on the south side.

No state income tax. No city tax for owning a car. The local government actually gives a shit. People who live here actually give a shit about their property and their neighbors. You'll get the occasional gutter punk downtown who will give you shit for holding a Nordstrom bag, but they scare easily.

"Actually, Expedia is in serious trouble.  The airlines are spending a lot of effort to get the OTAs out of the mix and encourage direct bookings - they want the ability to sell ancillary services like priority boarding, wi-fi, and better seats on their own sites.  

Booking through Expedia really doesn't offer many benefits - their customer service is usually worse than the airlines (as if such a thing were even possible) and prices are almost never better.  The only reason to use them is to book a multi-airline itinerary or to take advantage of a consolidator fare packaged with a hotel or rental car.

The hotel business is healthier, since it's more distributed, but even that is moving more toward direct bookings.  In five years, if Expedia doesn't figure out a new way to motivate people to use them, they'll be largely replaced by meta-search engines like Google Flights and Kayak.

Edit to add source (Expedia's 10K filing from February):

&gt; Travel suppliers: Some of our competitors, including travel suppliers such as airlines and hotels, may offer products and services on more favorable terms to consumers who transact directly with them, including lower prices, no fees or unique access to proprietary loyalty programs, such as points and miles. Many of these competitors, such as airlines, hotel and rental car companies, have been steadily focusing on increasing online demand on their own websites and mobile applications in lieu of third-party distributors such as the various Expedia sites. For instance, some low cost airlines, which are having increasing success in the marketplace, distribute their online supply exclusively through their own websites and several large hotel chains have combined to establish a single online hotels search platform with links directly to their own websites and mobile applications. Suppliers who sell on their own websites, in some instances, offer advantages such as favorable rates, increased or exclusive product availability, complimentary Wi-Fi, and their own bonus miles or loyalty points, or in the case of airlines promote hotel supply at their websites, which could make their offerings more attractive to consumers than ours.",,,,mofang,,,1458665876,t5_2qhad,t3_4bet2h,t1_d192zsn,11,1460809084,0,0,d19bqdy,Seattle,11,,

"Been a long time lurker on reddit, but this question from u/ifilmthat (am I doing it right?) was enough to cause me to jump into the fray.

I know this probably isn't super helpful, but the first thing to remember is that people become/remain homeless for many different reasons.  Some are fleeing violence, abuse, or trauma.  Some fell into poverty; others have always been in poverty.  Some have long struggled with alcohol and drugs; others didn't find alcohol or drugs until they were already on the streets.  Some (the younger ones) were kicked out or rejected for some reason (religion, sexual orientation, gender identity are the three I hear most commonly).  Others fled because the monsters on the streets are far less scary than the monsters at home.  Some have never known anything we would call a safe or stable home.  All that to say, there is no one reason.

But, as others have said below (above?), there are some common trends we see among homeless folks.  The ones I see most often:

1)  The 2008 recession made a lot of people homeless, including whole families.  And we know from the data that the poorest in our society have not seen their incomes rise since 2008.  They are still struggling to survive.  Complicating this is that there are often a limited number of family/couple shelter beds, so families may have to split up between different shelters, or if they choose, stay outside in order to stay together.  Similarly, many shelters have restrictions related to age, gender, and pets, so families can get separated in all sorts of ways.  This makes it harder to get help and harder to get back together.

2)  The job market hasn't really recovered for the poorest of the poor.  Sure Starbucks might be hiring, but if you are homeless with no work history and just GED, and you're interviewing against a bunch of middle class suburban kids with bachelors degrees, your chances are slim, even at Starbucks.  Plus, how are you supposed to show up at work each day without a bed to sleep in, a place to wash your clothes, or a shower.

3) Things that regularly coincide with homelessness--such as addiction, mental health issues, abuse/assault/rape, petty crime charges (it's a illegal to lay down on the sidewalk in Seattle!), sexual exploitation, lack of education, debt/no credit, etc, etc.--make it extremely difficult to get out of the hole you're in.  Many services for homeless folks--including many shelters, ""affordable"" housing, healthcare, education programs, etc--have numerous barriers that make them inaccessible to homeless folks.

4)  Most homeless adults started out as homeless youth.  And we know that most homeless youth are either kicked out, fleeing abuse, or were in the foster care system and never adopted.  The system is really fucked up, and while there are some good people out there giving valiant efforts to make changes, there are still a lot of gaps and missing resources.  We, as a society, really are failing these people.

All the above factors can be seen in some form or another across the whole of the US.  Add to then some location-specific factors, such as Seattle's mild climate, current housing crisis, grunge legacy (if you have to look grungy all the time due to your circumstance, why not go to a place where looking grungy is cool!), and status as the biggest city in a six state region (WA, AK, ID, MT, OR, WY) and you have the perfect confluence of factors for terribly high rates of homelessness.

"Literally completely false:

2012	- 34% effective tax rate, $2,007,000,000 paid in income tax

2013 - 23.7% effective tax rate, $1,646,000,000 paid in income tax

2014	- 26.4% effective tax rate, $1,691,000,000 paid in income tax

The 2013 and 2014 effective rates decreased thanks to adjusted audit settlements with the IRS in which previous years saw the corporation overburdened by regulation rates. Boeing also took advantage of several large research tax credits for technologies and scientific advancement deemed vital by the US Government. In addition, they claimed $212 million of previously unrecognized tax benefits. Their non-GAAP operating margin in 2014 was just 8.2%.

Just saying. I'm sure he's referring to the tax ""loophole"" that Boeing uses where once it begins building a new aircraft it can basically defer taxes until it is finished, in this way there are occasions it looks like they pay no income tax when in actuality most of the money they are paying in comes from deferred taxes from years ago.

Essentially, Boeing is paying for taxes it actually acquired years ago, and will pay the taxes on their new aircraft a few years from now, this can be misconstrued into saying they don't pay income tax when in actuality the majority of the money every year is going to what are essentially ""back taxes"".

"Most people how've had the pleasure of taking the 44 during the UW peak hours would agree that a UW-Ballard line is essential. The 44 becomes especially uninhabitable during the warmer days when it's packed and the bus driver runs the heater for some reason. 

As a side note, I like how the article simultaneously talks about getting rid of the e-line while mentioning that a subway would compliment the e-line as another modality. While I recognize the risk that large transit vehicles pose to traffic on Aurora I hope we base restructuring efforts on studies and not popular lore.  Reducing e-line service on Aurora may look good on paper and sound good in speech, but it could end up having negative or dentrimental side effects on that corridor. 

One point of contention that I'm surprised to not see in the article is a potential increase of sidewalk traffic with pedestrians. The 45th street channel isn't the most friendly, efficient or timely area for pedestrians to cross streets or walk through some neighborhoods. Additional funds may be needed to increase the safety of the area , enforce speed limits or bolster existing infrastructure.

Edited to add:

There's nothing about your post, OP, that makes anything about your move to Seattle make any sense. That's what's really so frustrating about it.

Your comment about Portland being a downgrade from Vegas -- VEGAS!!! -- makes me wonder if you have done any kind of homework on this move at all. NEWS FLASH: you will have less space, you will pay more for it, and the moss will have eaten the wood halfway through the rental property structure but 10 other Amazonians with six-figure salaries will fight you tooth and nail to beat you to the punch. And that's just the rental market ...

There is absolutely nothing about your post that appears to make the move to Seattle worth it for you, so I'm left wondering why you would even consider it at all if your version of simpatico is VEGAS. Seattle is a bit more urban than Portland, but not anything like Vegas and you are moving in the wrong direction for all of that, frankly.

You should consider Phoenix, instead. It's probably going to be more your speed and way more in your budget.",,,,dump_cake,,,1457165714,t5_2qhad,t3_491mex,t3_491mex,17,1460446616,0,0,d0octqc,Seattle,17,,

"Follow the logic here:  To get this guy the help he needs, he must be arrested for his crimes and put in the system.  He should not be allowed to squat in a designated ""safe zone"" and do a bunch of drugs which make his condition worse.  Therefore, to get the mentally ill who  have been drawn to Seattle by Mayor Murray's Siren Song of ""Cops won't mess with you there"" the help that they need, we must clear out every single squatter camp (Tent, RV, or otherwise) in the city.  Clearing out the camp exposes the crimes the squatters commit, which puts them in the system, which gets them the mental evaluation they need.

If this guy has Bipolar/Schizophrenia, there are drugs that manage those conditions.  Surprise surprise however, the side effects make them no fun to take, especially when you are addicted to Heroin, Meth, and booze.  You can't get a  guy mental health assistance if you allow him and his buddies to hangout on the corner panhandling for drug money, and shooting up in an RV or tent without fear of getting hassled.

People who bemoan the state of mental health assistance in the country, what would you have the government do?  Forcibly institutionalize people?  The State won't allow it.  They are tired of getting involved in scandal after scandal of warehoused mentally ill people winding up getting mistreated by their over burdened care givers.  Like housing projects which expose the state to any blame for housing conditions, so too is the State getting out of the business of mental institutions as fast as they can.  They don't want the risk of scandal.  Replacing a housing project with Section 8 housing vouchers are pretty straight forward, but what do you do with evicted mental health patients in hospitals?  Are there a bunch of private mental health institutes that are willing to take on the problems that our street people bring with them?  Hell no. No way.

Therefore in summary, the best way to help the mentally ill, is to enforce the city laws which discourage squatting and panhandling.  What Seattle does is enable the mentally ill to go buck wild on their drug and alcohol problems, with predictable results.  Then, sure enough when an enabled squatter commits a crime, whether it be defecating from the top of a tall tree, or caving the head in of some woman underneath the Magnolia bridge with a 2X4 we hear: ""oh that poor man, he is mentally ill.""

Can we force people to get treatment for their mental illness?  Can we force them to take their prescription medication that treats their mental illness? No and no.  For this reason their crimes are their responsibility, and their responsibility alone.  The BEST a society can do is strictly enforce the laws that discourage squatter camp sites.  To do otherwise is to actively encourage mentally ill people to magnify their problems via drug use.  Society should not be doing this.",,,,DorsalMorsel,,,1459377698,t5_2qhad,t3_4cm4v8,t3_4cm4v8,23,1460987945,0,0,d1jpaef,Seattle,23,,

"The public outcry and attention is warranted but the calls for walls, fences, container ships, homeless camps, etc. is counterproductive because these measures simply will not happen. Many are outside the scope of capabilities of a city government and all would wind up on the wrong side of a challenge in court. These ideas continue to create noise when the real focus is in the last paragraph of this article. The only way these homeowners, their lawyers, and future perpetrators will take notice is through the suggested “shock-and-awe-inspiring fine”. Seek the absolute maximum amount permitted under any and every applicable law and do not waiver in settlement. That should be the public message for anyone that wants to see justice.

If this event evokes any of your emotions, no matter what side of the issue you may be on, the best means for preventing this from happening again is to encourage more public attention. Let current perpetrators and anyone else considering similar acts see the attention such acts will garner. If you want more pressure on our local politicians to send a message, there is no better tool than the media. Put down the pitchfork and make this a national story by sending emails, tweets, or calls to the AP, CNN, BBC, MSNBC, NPR, etc and encouraging them to pick up the story. All these national outlets have ways to suggest stories, just pick a few and forward the story. A national following would not only help educate locals and communicate the importance of full justice to our local leaders but would help other communities avoid the same tragedy.

&gt; *This 2160 sf single-family home was completed in 2009.*

&gt; *The project is sited on a difficult, highly-regulated site with a steep slope to the west and a large railroad easement and setback to the east. In response to these challenges, the concrete foundation and cellar are set the required distance back from the slope, and the framed portion of the house is extended over the steep slope buffer to access the water view. This method of extending volumes and elements over others is carried throughout the project, ultimately establishing a simple parti of two stacked rectangular volumes that elevate over the site. The second floor volume is rotated from the axis of the linear first floor volume, creating a covered entry, a stair enclosure, access to a roof garden, and focusing the bedroom, bath and office to views of the Sound and the Olympic Mountains.*

&gt; *Massing and fenestration are informed by the heavy volume of train activity to the east. The linear scheme allows for the east wall to act as a barrier to insulate both the interior of the house and the west yard from the railroad noise. While the west elevation is largely glazed to allow access to the water view and the view of the mountains, the east wall has few openings to maintain the solidity necessary for sound protection.*

&gt; *Access to the house is along a board walk that is elevated over a sunken garden. This garden space and the accessible green roof were important to the clients desiring a transition to terra firma after residing on a boat for 14 years.*

&gt; *A minimal palette of inexpensive finish materials was used to achieve an economy of scale and reduce transition details. For example; an inexpensive concrete fiber board was used for most exterior surfaces, accented by smaller area of cedar siding. Tight-knot rough cedar is selected rather than expensive clear cedar. This roughness is balanced with the smooth concrete fiber board to achieve both harmony and economy. Extensive glazing was desired on the west elevation. Rather than install an expensive curtain-wall system, less expensive aluminum nail-fin windows were ganged together and trimmed with aluminum break shapes to achieve a similar effect for a reduced cost.*",,,,slyweazal,,,1457065897,t5_2qhad,t3_48vu1o,t3_48vu1o,10,1460423118,0,0,d0mzhgp,Seattle,10,,

"I was recently reading about the multifamily market in Houston.  A TON of new ""luxury"" supply has come online over the last two years, at the same time oil went into free fall.  The first year, landlords were trying to collude to prop up rents.  None of the big developers wanted to be the first one to cut rents.  Then, some of them finally broke the implicit agreement and started offering concessions.  Finally, some of the developers decided the apartments had sat empty long enough and started slashing rents like crazy to try to get their units filled up before the other landlords started competing to fill them.  Some of the new complexes have cut rents by 20%, while the landlords who aren't willing to compete to fill their units don't have any tenants.  So yes, landlords are slow to drop rents, but once the switch flips from a landlord's market to a tenant's market, things can change extremely fast.  Seattle's vacancy still seems very low though, so I wouldn't expect too much.

We need to find out how much of this timeline is in the control of Sound Transit. There may be some major holdups that they must legally abide by unless there is significant political will. Ultimately, if they are unable to significantly revise the timeline before the vote, I will likely still vote for the measure, because I think it will help the region and can perhaps be implemented quicker with enough local support.

"This is a dangerous myth that gets repeated often; Seattle doesn't ""cater"" to folks living in extreme poverty any more than anywhere else. Most of our shelters don't allow pets or service animals, and opposite-gender parents are often separated. There's really nothing about our services that are more appealing than anywhere else, other than that we're a large city which means more services, generally. Per AllHome King County, 87% of people living outside in King county report that their last known address was in the county, and 97 percent are from somewhere in Washington State (these numbers vary depending on who you ask, but the general consensus is that the vast majority of folks living outside are actually from here).

"Muslims are not a race. They are followers of Islam, a religion; not racist. But that isn't really what upsets you. It more the actual banning of Muslims from entering the country. If you read his statement on his website, it calls for a temporary ban until the situation with the hatred/ISIS is dealt with. Recent estimates put the Muslim population at 1.6 billion people. Even if just 5% were radicalized, which by the way is lower than current estimates, that would mean that there are 80 million people that want the destruction of America. How can you possibly monitor or combat such a massive quantity of people without total lockdown? 

This is legal through our United States Constitution.

**(f)Suspension of entry or imposition of restrictions by President**

Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.

**You have to look at why someone would say something so polarizing and not instantly condemn them because you do not agree.**

"&gt; Why would you think any condo downtown would be under $500K?

Because, as Edward Glaeser points out in ""[How Skyscrapers Can Save the City](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2011/03/how-skyscrapers-can-save-the-city/308387/),"" that's close to the cost of construction for high-rises: 

&gt;Prices do rise substantially in ultra-tall buildings—say, over 50 stories—but for ordinary skyscrapers, it doesn’t cost more than $500,000 to put up a nice 1,200-square-foot apartment. The land costs something, but in a 40-story building with one 1,200-square-foot unit per floor, each unit is using only 30 square feet of Manhattan—less than a thousandth of an acre. At those heights, the land costs become pretty small. If there were no restrictions on new construction, then prices would eventually come down to somewhere near construction costs, about $500,000 for a new apartment. That’s a lot more than the $210,000 that it costs to put up a 2,500-square-foot house in Houston—but a lot less than the $1 million or more that such an apartment often costs in Manhattan. 

In the absence of parochial land-use controls, older high-rise condos would likely fall below $500,000. That none are that inexpensive points to pent-up demand among both consumers and builders. ",,,,jseliger,,,1457112777,t5_2qhad,t3_48y194,t1_d0nhoxs,11,1460432680,0,0,d0njq3x,Seattle,11,,

* The number of kids in K-12 increased by 12,135 between 2008 and 2010, but the number of teachers in classrooms shrunk by nearly 3,000.

* Over 20,000 eligible students were unable to receive financial aid in 2010 due to insufficient state resources.

* Over 20,000 adults and children have lost assistance needed for families to get and keep a job.

* Approximately 7,000 low-income working parents have lost crucial child care support, which helps them remain in the workforce.

* Roughly 20,000 individuals who cannot work due to a disability have seen their income support vanish.

"I suppose people without souls have to live *somewhere*, but it's a sad testament to the sorry state of our mental health system that there are so many of them and that their numbers are growing so quickly. Why are we just forcing them away to these desolate camps, abandoning them to solve their problems on their own? Can't we help them? Our economy is booming - surely we can afford to get these unfortunates the help they need instead of just leaving them to struggle and suffer through their meaningless lives devoid of art, culture, nightlife, or society. How hard they struggle, though! Look with compassionate eyes, and underneath that thick layer of suffocating plastic, you can see that they're really trying to meet the same needs we are - they are human, too, if you can let yourself see it.

Out of sight, out of mind, though - I guess too many Seattleites would rather just make the problem go away by sending these impoverished wretches off to the other side of the lake than actually bother to lend a hand to a fellow citizen in need.

"&gt; Countries with stricter gun laws like Australia and the UK have fewer gun deaths.

Those two countries are also vastly different socioeconomically compared to the US.  How many gang members are in London?  

&gt;In February 2007, criminologist Dr John Pitts, from the University of Bedfordshire, said: ""There are probably **no more than 1,500 to 2,000** young people in gangs in all of London,[54] but their impact is enormous"".

**Chicago has 150,000 gang members** with 80% of the murders being committed by gang members.

Gangs accounted for 65% of firearms related homicides in England/Wales.

Lets compare countries that are much more similar and see what firearm bans have done:

&gt;The current paper examines the incidence of mass shootings in Australia and New Zealand (a country that is socioeconomically similar to Australia, but with a different approach to firearms regulation) over a 30 year period. [**It does not find support for the hypothesis that Australia’s prohibition of certain types of firearms has prevented mass shootings,**](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2122854) with **New Zealand not experiencing a mass shooting since 1997 despite the availability in that country of firearms banned in Australia.** These findings are discussed in the context of social and economic trends.

**Edit: PLEASE, I am putting emphasis on being civil and respectful when contacting your reps. Be a good rep yourself. :)**




Call your representatives and ask that they switch their pledged superdelegate votes from Hillary Clinton to Bernie Sanders.
They do not represent us if they ignore the will of the people who elected them.


Governor Jay Inslee (declared for Clinton) 360-902-4111

Senator Patty Murray (declared for Clinton) (206) 553-5545

Senator Maria Cantwell (declared for Clinton) (206) 220-6400

Representative Suzan DelBene (declared for Clinton) (360) 416-7879

Representative Denny Heck (declared for Clinton) (253) 722-5860

Representative Derek Kilmer (declared for Clinton) (360) 373-9725

Representative Rick Larsen (declared for Clinton) 425-252-3188

Representative Jim McDermott (declared for Clinton) (206)-553-7170

Representative Adam Smith (declared for Clinton) (425) 793-5180


If you live in the districts of any of these representatives, make sure to let them know that it is YOUR vote that will determine their reelection chances, and so they had better represent your interests as they were elected to do. Keep in mind that these fundamentally undemocratic super delegates declared for Clinton BEFORE we even had our state caucus! Keep your messages civil but clear.

"Kirkland, Kenmore, and Bothell aren't going to pay a dime for Seattle's light rail anyway, because that is the whole point of subarea equity. Whatever money gets raised out there will go to projects in East King subarea.

The problem is not that Seattle wants the region to pay for its subway; the problem is that ST has to propose a single plan, with a single funding mechanism, for its entire taxing region. Everyone in the region has to sign off on that single funding plan. ST must then spend the money raised in each subarea on projects benefiting that subarea.

Seattle needs, wants, and is willing to pay for lots more transit than any other subarea, but ST cannot tax Seattle more to pay for it, because ST has to fund Seattle projects through the same region-wide tax it is allowed to collect everywhere else. 

That means that ST's ability to move Seattle transit forward is forever limited by the tax rate they can convince the rest of the region to accept. Raising more money in Seattle means raising more money in other subareas, whether they need it or not, while convincing the other subareas to vote for the plan by making it cost less means raising less money and accomplishing less in Seattle.

This is why the ST3 plan includes a **billion dollars' worth** of park'n'rides, and a light rail line to Issaquah which is projected to serve all of 11,000 riders: not because those projects are the best way to spend that money, but because raising enough money to do anything useful in Seattle will generate such a surplus in the rest of ST's tax area that they can afford to splurge - in fact they are *obligated* to splurge, in order to maintain ""equity"".",,,,marssaxman,The CD,,1459453434,t5_2qhad,t3_4cqils,t1_d1ksg75,13,1461007718,0,0,d1kuh8p,Seattle,13,,flair

"Not all states put fiscal policy up to vote. Every state that does this sees major budget shortfalls. The initiative system is a failure when it comes to managing fiscal policy, due to voter myopia, among other reasons.

[Analyses](http://www.peninsuladailynews.com/article/20151108/NEWS/311089991) by State Supreme Court Justices to academic economists have pointed to the use of voter initiatives as one contributor to both blocking reform of regressive tax policies and fixing budget gaps. 

State Supreme Court Justice Charles Wiggins acknowledged that while the use of initiatives is a “great process,” the Legislature “has to match income with outflow, and there is no such requirement in an initiative.”  

Likewise, an [academic analysis](http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/102220371/voter-initiatives-their-impact-states-budget-balance) of 24 states’ voter initiatives found that the reliance on direct voter approval for specific tax and budget measures tends to increase expenditures, limit taxes, and create major budget shortfalls.

"Unfortunately, Sound Transit is required to operate in reality and not in the fantasy land that many in this subreddit seem to think exists.

__Too Little__  
This package represents at least $15 billion in investment. This has to be collected via taxes which means this has to go on a ballot. Just last year, a bill for King County Metro asking for merely $40 million was rejected largely due to campaigning by those who don't use mass transit and don't think they should fund it. Now they are looking to pass a bill nearly 400× more expensive in largely the same electorate. It is already questionable if they can get this passed and raising the cost would only make it more unlikely.

__Too Late__  
Despite what you might desire, Sound Transit doesn't have the capacity for time travel. Yes, the best time to have started this phase would have been 20-30 years ago, but voters repeatedly rejected funding for new mass transit systems. Perhaps you mean that the project should be built more quickly, but that would dramatically increase the costs. This gets back to the previous point that increasing the costs most likely would mean a failed initiative.


In summary. You may consider yourself an ardent transit advocate, but you aren't one with any kind of grasp on reality. If you support transit, then you should support this bill and lobby for further expanding funding in the future to accelerate it further.",,,,Fritzed,Kirkland,,1459362070,t5_2qhad,t3_4cl53t,t1_d1japte,13,1460982298,0,0,d1jdgfg,Seattle,13,,flair

"The jungle is not a homeless camp.  The truly homeless people camp in safer places.  For example, near 4th and Washington, near 9th and Stewart, in the U. District, in Ballard.

The jungle is more like an occupation of the mid-level heroin and meth dealers (and cooks) in an area where they know the police won't go.

I've been in one tent in the jungle.  In it were 4 Vietnamese dudes in their 50s, all healthy, selling drugs to people.  They had a propane tank that was much larger than a grill tank in there.  It had the attachment that can be used to cook meth, or crack, and they sold meth, crack, heroin, etc.  They had improvised death traps that they probably derived from Vietnam War techniques and I'm not going to explain.  But once I saw a propane tank and a lethal booby trap all in one 6'x6' space with the drug dealers, it was time to leave the tent, at least.

Returning to the ""outdoor"" environment of the jungle, I was waiting around when a fight broke out.  An uncoordinated guy was swinging a wheeled hand-truck at a pretty good boxer, who was dodging the hand truck.  It looked pretty much like the boxer guy was about to cream the dude swinging a hand-truck at him.  (One of those 4' tall wheeled things for moving heavy stuff.)  So, I took off.

I had gone down there to check it out with someone who was already on a mission to go there.  It was the first time I had been in or near the jungle at night, and the first time I went in very far at all.  That was about 10 days prior to the recent shooting.

A few thoughts:

1) If even one propane tank blows up down there, people on I-5 could die.  I've seen the way a grill-sized propane tank burns, and for how long.  If the oversized tank I saw in the jungle, sitting next to exposed high-current 24VDC wiring, were to blow up somehow...  It would be so bad, words fail me.

2) When people who live in a rough area of a city name it ""The Jungle,"" they are referring to the Guns-n-Roses song, and they aren't kidding.  The Jungle is way worse than the Blade (Westlake-Belltown), ""The Blade"" is kind of a creepy name.  But the people who speak Thieves' Cant dialect reserve ""The Jungle"" for the place where you really might get dragged into the bushes and eaten, or worse.

3) Putting plumbing into the Jungle is so fantastically stupid a suggestion that I hope it wasn't really made by a Council member.  Holy shit.

4) The only viable solution to The Jungle is to clear it out.  This is orthogonal to the question of homelessness.  If we want to facilitate street living, there are lots of ways we could do so.  For example, we could erect a huge tent next to the Union Gospel mission.  We could clear out the construction fences in that area and sleep another 1-200 homeless, easy.  We could open up some shelters in SoDo, etc.

5) The homeless people that everybody wants to help don't need the Jungle.  The only people who need the Jungle are people who are trying to avoid police, by operating in a zone that is outside the local police jurisdiction.

6) It is a huge problem that the SPD don't have jurisdiction over the ground-level area under I-5.  The State Legislature must change this.  That strip of land in Seattle is part of Seattle, and it does not make sense to carve out hiding places and ambush locations within the SPD jurisdiction.  Every on-ramp and overpass creates an area in which SPD's agency is reduced by law.  That's why we have the Jungle.  The problem is one the legislature can easily solve.

7) Truth sets us free, and light shows us the truth.  Installing way less than $1 million in bullet-resistant bright lighting under the I-5 would do almost everything needed to clear up the problem.  

8) Throw in video cameras watching the area, and suddenly it's less of a worry.  Clear it out one time, then watch the video to see if people are bringing in oversized propane tanks on hand-trucks.  Computers can watch the video, or centrally located staff can randomly sample the feeds.  It doesn't have to be expensive to patrol an area with cameras.  In fact, even if nobody watches the cameras, their apparent presence is helpful.  On the other hand, cameras without responses did no good for Freeway Park, and the police had to clean it up recently.

This would at least clean up the parts of the Jungle in the North, the area that touches Dearborn.  That is a go-to place for certain hard drugs, especially heroin.  Sometimes people come out the door of Harborview, walk down the hill through Yesler Terrace, and then into the Jungle for some heroin, or some crack, or some meth.  Othertimes people take the E line from Shoreline and get off near 4th and Washington, near the Union Gospel Mission.  Then it's just like 3-5 blocks to the Jungle.  Other people come from the southern approach and enter the Jungle on North Beacon Hill, west of 12th Ave in the woodsy part of the jungle.

Putting lights under the freeway would leave the woodsy part near 12th Ave on North Beacon Hill unsolved.  This is an issue for a few reasons, but I don't think the camping situation would move into the woodsy part.  The ground is too steep and uneven for the same behavior to take place.  

Similarly, putting a fence around the highly-inclined woodsy part won't help much.  It's only possible to patrol around the outside of such a fence.  So, if someone gets in, what would you do about it?  Fix the fence with them inside? This area has been used in the past to dump bodies and other such nice features.  I wonder if one day we will have to remediate the geological stability of that hillside in a manner which involves cutting all those trees down.

"Use a U-lock. Cables and all but the thickest, hardest chains are beyond useless as a primary lock. If possible, keep your bike in a private lockup near your office (?). Don't leave your bike in places without foot traffic or anywhere overnight if you don't want it to get stolen or stripped for parts. This is all assuming, of course, that you have a reasonably nice bike; if it's a beater with a good lock thieves might be less interested.

Probably ride down Pike or Pine or Olive, but watch for cars and especially pedestrians stepping out. Boren and Denny are scary and probably best avoided. Don't forget that there is an overpass over I-5 down by Lakeview that comes out near REI, might be useful depending on what part of the hill you live on.

Always wear a helmet. Try to anticipate what the cars and pedestrians around you are going to do, and if in doubt, slow down. Watch the *fuck* out on Dexter south of Mercer or you *will* die. Don't be an asshole; I couldn't care less if you blow lights and stop signs when nobody's around but if you make someone who has the right of way slow down then that's a dick move and you're making us look bad.

Absolute best case scenario as I see it: the program brings in more than it costs, and you still have a bunch of homeless people.  Liklihood of homeless people paying fines for illegal dumping, by the way, gotta be pretty close to zero.

The thing is, the crimes that some of the homeless are committing are petty.  Ramping up enforcement against petty crime doesn't actually produce the effect I'm guessing you want: for the homeless to stop being homeless...or at least to stop being a nuisance.

This is a (predatory, among other things) guy driving up in a car and a drunk girl getting in it.  It has nothing to do with uber, save for the fact that uber conditions drunk people to get into cars.

I've heard so many stories about people being scared of uber drivers raping them, and this headline definitely plays into that fear, but it seems like that's just fear mongering from cabbies.

Uber, if you're actually using it and not hopping in random cars, at least provides a record that you hailed driver X, you get a picture to verify it's driver X, and there's a GPS record of where you went and when (or a record that they turned their app off).  All those records are on a remote server.  Compare that to a cab, where even if you called them beforehand there's no central authority as to which cabbie picked you up, you have no way of knowing if the guy that picks you up is a valid driver or someone in a yellow car, and if they drive straight to mexico there's no record anywhere that you ever interacted with cabbie Y at all.

"First off, I never worked at Boeing, but have lived here 25 years, and what follows is my own .02 on what happened.  If anyone that worked there wants to correct any of this that's wrong, by all means please do.

Part of why they moved the HQ was logistics, they got tired of flying cross country from Washington DC to Seattle on lobbying trips.

And part of it was, the minute the executives quit Seattle, they no longer had to hear about the negative results of their decisions from their neighbors.  It was hard on them to screw over the unions here and outsource jobs away when it impacted people they also went to church with, or would see out around Everett and Mukilteo and Edmonds.


There's a profound accountability when decisions you make affect your neighbor's kids.  They got rid of that by getting out of Puget Sound and moving to Chicago.  Now, if they outsource, it's just another region in the Boeing corporate empire being fucked over, not ""home.""

Also, the last and most powerful of the McDonnell executives that would up being an important political cabal inside Boeing was heavily behind the decision - Stonecipher and the other ones.  He was a prime mover of this stuff - Phil Condit was just the yes man doing what Stonecipher wanted him to do.

It was often remarked in years after the McDonnell buyout that McDonnell's policies and politics actually wound up running Boeing, that ""McDonnell bought Boeing, not the other way around.""  Boeing had been an engineering-first company, after McDonnell executives got inside the company, they started successfully changing culture from quality of product to bottom-line-only, and from engineering-focused family to an executive-and-worker style hierarchy.  Boeing stopped being a company where decisions were made based on the best engineering opinion available, and started resembling more like an MBA-management style of company, or a Jack Welch style of management company.

Alan Mullaly was the last big engineering-first CEO Boeing had - and he quit the company to go work for Ford.  He saw his path in Boeing was going to be marginalized by the management style change under Condit, but really influenced heavily by Stonecipher and his former McDonnell allies.  

All of these things play a role in why they moved to Chicago.",,,,my_lucid_nightmare,Capitol Hill,,1458266191,t5_2qhad,t3_4aw2xu,t3_4aw2xu,86,1460717910,0,0,d141rmd,Seattle,86,,flair

"You have to remember that someone who buys a $1M house in cash is not spending half their net worth on these transactions. They likely have at least $10M, if not much more, and more importantly have the business connections to keep it coming in. 

After that it's simply another business bet. $1M in the bank does not make much profit on interest (relatively) so you have to do something with it. Real estate is fairly safe- a sweet house on good property in Vancouver won't go to zero quickly like a stock or bad business could. For foreigners, it's a hedge on the value of their money- and they see BC real estate as more stable than other investments in China. And (like everywhere really) a lot of them made their money through corrupt insider deals and crime- but their ill gotten gains can't be clawed back on foreign real estate transactions as easily as their local accounts. 

The reason they don't just park it in a CA or US mutual fund is because they already have money there and want to diversify into real estate, and sometimes out of vanity- all my friends bought mansions in BC and apartments in NYC. 

It's a hassle to rent- you have to pay someone to handle the transactions and maintain it, things can go wrong, etc. It takes time and energy to do this, it takes nothing to forget about the place. They just assume that the market will rise and they will flip it for more someday. Having a stable place to park money is the value, they are not going to care about the $20k annual profit they could theoretically make when they spend that in a day shopping.

"We are required to obey airspace requirements for the area.  Above Tiger Mountain, our ceiling is 5000' and 6000' just a bit east of launch.  There have been a few times where I've had to force myself to descend out of a strong thermal to avoid breaking airspace. (Both at the 5k and 6k level)  I've been a bit higher above Snoqualmie Pass before, and I think my highest was just under 12k out in Mexico.  There are competitions out in the rockies where pilots usually bring supplemental oxygen for when they get REALLY high.  It gets really cold up there, so if you see some guy dressed like an Eskimo out in a field during the heat of summer, they're likely a pilot who recently landed. 

Yeah, the area can get pretty congested near Tiger in the summer as the weather gets better.  On a really good day, there's someone who usually makes one of those calls into the flight service for us if we foresee a lot of pilots going cross country, or going really high.  Personally, I've only had one little Cessna spot me a little later than I had hoped, and made a rather sudden aggressive bank to avoid a potential mid-air.

"The city had three options really:

1. Wait for an earthquake. It is widely believed that any significant earthquake would cause the viaduct to collapse at this point. Once this happened, the city could take reactive measures to fix it, possibly taking years and reducing the entire city to one main north-south highway in the meantime.

2. Replace the viaduct. The retrofitting needed to make the current viaduct earthquake safe was estimated around the same cost as a complete replacement.

3. Use Bertha to tunnel, demolish the viaduct and use the new space to create a more attractive waterfront.

While the performance of Bertha has been a laughingstock, the idea itself was far and away the best of the three. Seattle will be hit by an earthquake eventually, we can't just sit there and let it destroy one of our two main highways in the process.

"Hey dude, let's think of a *totally hypothetical* situation here. A thought experiment.  **What if**, in some completely imagined scenario, there existed a city where there was a large homeless population.  At the same time, there is a large problem with bike theft in this place.  It's so bad, every single person with a bicycle knows they must not only lock it, but keep it hidden away or it will be brazenly stolen. 

No assumptions or implication have been made. This is a progressive place with thoughtful residents. Again, hypothetical.

But now, the mayor's office decides to send a huge police surveillance task force to figure out who are these bike thief perpetrators! They install a GPS tracker on every bicycle in the city. Once their data is collected, they release the results. 

As it turns out, of the 800 bicycles stolen during their month of surveillance, that 675 bicycles (84%) were stolen and taken to known encampments of the city's homeless population and chopped for parts.  The police also know the city contains about 1,500 homeless in a city of 500,000.  So from this data, we know even if every bicycle were stolen by a different person, more than half the homeless population can not be said to have committed these crimes.  But the data forces the Mayor to take some position on the correlation of bike theft with the relatively small homeless community on a per capita basis.

Their analysis concludes:

* A majority of bicycle thefts can be traced to homeless encampments, therefore most bikes could be said to be stolen by the homeless.

* The majority of homeless people in the city did not steal bikes, even if 675 homeless people stole 675 bikes, that is only 45% of the population.

The task force releases their data and findings to their constituents.  

Without imposing self-censorship, how does the community then talk about these results, or more in general, the issue at hand?  In your mind is this even possible?  Or is preserving the image of the homeless and preventing stereotypes from forming more important?  

The way I see it, you are insisting people are making implications when they are not. But regardless of what is happening here, in your opinion, how could these hypothetical constituents talk about the homeless bike theft problem in a way that doesn't degrade all of the homeless? Thanks.",,,,ReducingRadius,Crown Hill,,1457726700,t5_2qhad,t3_4a01gm,t1_d0wasyz,31,1460584768,0,1,d0wctcg,Seattle,31,,flair crown-hill

"they key is to be consistently overtaking the cars to the right of you, as soon as you are no longer actively passing you need to merge to the right. 

And yes there is a reason to get ""pissy"" about being stuck behind someone that could be doing the exact same speed in the immediate lane to the right. You should be merging back and forth from the travel lane (right lanes) into the passing lane (left lane), not swerving. By taking this stand of ""i dont want to be bothered to have to change lanes"" you are then causing traffic flow to not function and may cause another driver to do some dumbass unsafe maneuver to try and get a round you. Studies show and WSP agrees that it is more dangerous to the motoring public to have the hall monitor in the left lane holding up someone, than it is to have a speeding car. Some people may be wanting to go ten over, but others may want to go 15, 20, 30 miles an hour over the speed limit.

Merging lanes is part of driving, it shouldn't be a chore, actually adjust your mirrors and its pretty damn easy. By breaking one law because you don't want others to break another law, you are just adding more lawlessness to this land. Two negatives don't make a positive. If you leave they left lane open then those who want to go fast will be there and be easier pickings for WSP.

"Despite the snarky tone, I'm upvoting this because I think, beneath the snark, there's a genuine question that deserves an answer. Heads up, it's gonna be a couple of paragraphs, but if you've got the patience, hear me out.

Seattle's built on two peninsulas (and a bunch of hills), and that means we've got relatively little surface area to work with, compared with other cities our size. This space is shared between businesses, housing and infrastructure. Over the past twenty or so years, Seattle has grown immensely, but the methods of getting into, out of and through Seattle have not.

We still have essentially the same road system we did in the 1970s, and the city is choking because of it. Overcrowded roads turn into parking lots twice a day for *hours* on end. The need for better transit is pressing, but the catch is that there's just no more room to put bigger and wider roads in our limited available space (not to mention that adding more roads just incentivizes people to drive more, which then fills up the roads again, et cetera).

Compare this to places like Issaquah, where the traffic congestion is not nearly as bad, where development is spread out (which makes it hard to get to a train/bus station in the first place), and where, for the moment, cars can efficiently serve as the main means of getting places. Issaquah is going to get light rail *years* before some of the most congested places in Seattle do.

It's not that transit to the suburbs is bad, it's that transit to the suburbs is being prioritized over a deeply pressing need for urban infrastructure.",,,,ctishman,,,1458941414,t5_2qhad,t3_4bxemb,t1_d1dgdrl,12,1460881056,0,0,d1dhysa,Seattle,12,,

No it does not - as evidenced by the most regressive tax structure in the nation.

This statement is invalid and your assumption is ignorant. The wealthy are citizens of a polity, and therefore must pay into public goods and services. Paying for a market-based, non-public service doesn't excuse them from their duty to pay taxes. 

Assuming that the ""less successful"" use public goods and services is prejudiced and patently ignorant. 

The wealthy enjoy the fruits of many public goods and services.

"The article does not even mention my favorite aspects of these homes.

They have actual hardwood floors made out of solid wood. The majority of new construction has hardwood laminate. The difference is solid hardwood floors last an extremely long time and deep scratches only make them look better. The laminate looks really terrible once something gouges through the thin upper layer and exposes the fiberboard underneath. 

Also plaster and lath walls of these old houses are much denser than drywall. These dense walls are incredibly adept at blocking sound between rooms (and neighbors in apartment buildings). Of course drywall is way easier to drill / nail things into and repair.

These old houses have the super duty picture rails. It is so easy to hang objects that are 50+ pounds on them provided you use the right hooks. Its so easy to rearrange your walls when everything is just hooked on. I wish this would make a comeback in modern construction.

The things I don't really like are the original non-insulated windows (many of these homes have been converted to insulated these days) and the tiny bathrooms. Why do all these homes have a toilet facing a bathtub separated by a tiny space?

"Dedicated right of way is the big one. Since the light rail runs in a tunnel, it's impossible for surface traffic conditions (traffic lights, cars, congestion, etc) to interfere. Now, of course it would be possible to run a bus instead of a train in the tunnel, but digging the tunnel is the big expense here, so doing so wouldn't save all that much money. It's also possible to run a fancy train on the street in the same traffic, and we've seen from the First Hill Streetcar that that fancy train performs no better than anything else stuck in traffic.

The only inherent benefit of rail over bus is capacity. A single train car carries a lot more people than your average bus, and you can keep adding train cars for very little extra cost. Most of the cost of operation comes from paying the driver, so if you can multiply the capacity of the line without hiring and paying more drivers, that's considered a good thing.

In Seattle, specifically, both of those benefits are being seen with the new line. Previously, buses were stuck in traffic and it could take up to 30 minutes to get from downtown to the U District, and that's not even considering a stop on Capitol Hill, now you can get between all three destinations in less than 10 minutes, and due to the capacity of the trains, hopefully no more leaving passengers at the curb like the 71/72/73. And now because of the first benefit, we have a pretty easily-predictable travel time too. Before, depending on traffic, it could anywhere between 10 and 30 minutes on an average day, now you're looking at basically the same figure regardless of day or time.",,,,macroclimate,,,1458809174,t5_2qhad,t3_4bqstr,t3_4bqstr,25,1460847591,0,0,d1bk1g5,Seattle,25,,
"To answer your question, in my limited experience on the subject, it really depends on the neighborhood you are moving to. I know you said downtown but that can be very broad in this city.  Living in Queen Anne is vastly different than Pioneer Square...

For example I live in Capitol Hill... 30m walk to heart of downtown... and while Im sure there is some 'bro culture' as you put it here from time to time its not like something you see out of the movies... 

Its also not really a residential thing and more a bar, night life thing.  But that applies to any sub culture. If you live near bars, tourist traps, etc. you'll get noises at 2am and what not.

That said there are plenty of places available near the above mentioned bars and tourist traps, but far enough away to avoid most noise. 

I'd recommend just getting out here if all possible and drive around before buying. Especially if you don't want to drive to work and use rail/bus instead.

ALSO in my experience loud homeless people in this city are far more obnoxious than anyone that could possibly be defined as 'bros' ;)

"Says the guy in the suburbs. To live in a city means to be around others. Seattle is built in a way that forces people to see each other, interact with one another. The city, to some people, is their living room. The people who come and go in a city are the culture. The eastside has room for sprawl so most interactions happen in shopping malls, in a city they happen while walking down the street. Currently Seattle is having a switch of people and new locals are being created. Those who live in the city now are learning the ways of the town or changing it. For better or worse. That's what a city is and that's why I still love Seattle. I also think it's important to see all walks of life. It's important to see the downtrodden, the homeless. To interact with them on a daily basis humanizes them and makes you act. Maybe you just buy them coffee, maybe you donate to a local shelter or volunteer once in a while.

"Just three? I worked my ass off after graduating into the recession, saved up 100k to buy my first place. Completely priced out. I've bid 75k over on shitty mid 2000's townhouses (everyone knows what i m talking about) and still lost. Market is fucked and I quit and I'm a lot happier now, developed some really violent and angry thoughts for a while, didn't realize I could succumb to so much emotion for something like home buying. At this rate I'm waiting for the market to crash/LAX up/supply increase, its not worth being in such massive debt for what's available. The markets and world economic conditions are also kind of dicey. If I'm priced out forever so be it, by that point Seattle won't be a place anyone wants to be - like vancouver.

*Edit* - more thoughts: post 2008 crash new construction pretty much just stopped, and there's years of supply that won't catch up anytime soon. In addition, policies in place sort of encourage only luxury housing to be produced as its the best profit margin for developers. The lack of supply artificially inflates the prices, exacerbated by people moving here, and the unique geography which makes building suck (and lack of infrastructure). Add the capital flight from places like china (real estate to hide their money), etc etc. It's not a good time to be a buyer.

Maybe it was just a meteorite that broke up right above the gas main explosion. I see a lot of that, meteorite's breaking up. Or maybe a meteorite hit a gas main. Who knows. 

What I saw was an explosion and downward falling debris that was right over Greenwood right and then an explosion in Greenwood.

"If I read right that your primary goal is to break into IT, and that you're leaving MO because you can't find work there, I'll suggest you look at other cities closer to home like OKC, Lincoln, Omaha, Pittsburgh, Minneapolis, Madison, Dallas. They all have healthy economies, and their companies all need the kind of IT work you're after, whether their business is tech or not. Some cities are even becoming tech hubs in their own right (Lincoln, Pittsburgh, maybe others.)

Where in MO? I've heard good things about tech in KC lately too, but you might know better than I do.

I say this because there is an extreme housing shortage in Seattle at the low and mid end. Not only does that mean housing is stupid expensive right now (risky for someone with everything on the line), it's also increasingly hard to find. That translates to a *lot* of lost time and energy, along with stress, that you don't need while trying to break into a new field.

Probably what others said about high competition for jobs applies too. I'd agree with the comments about getting certifications. You don't need to get a job to get those, just pay up take the courses.

If your primary goal is to get into Seattle, I guess that's a different conversation.

"The [SPD online reporting FAQ](http://www.seattle.gov/police/report/corpfaq.htm) says the following:
&gt; Can I use CORP to report a traffic collision? Answer
No. Washington State Law requires any law enforcement officer of the state, county, city, town, or other political subdivision to report each vehicle collision resulting in injury or death of any person, or damage to the property of any one person to an apparent extent of $700 or more. Unattended Hit and Run collisions are not eligible for online reporting, even if the damage value is under $700. 
For collisions with damage under the reporting threshold of $700, and not involving a Hit and Run, drivers may file a Citizen's Report with the Washington State Patrol.

"To be fair, I live in Magnolia.  I in no way shape or form agree with this guys actions to target someone who wasn't breaking the law and to use excessive force.  That being said, there has been an increase in crime recently in the area, probably BECAUSE it is removed from the city and because people feel safer and leave their guard down.  My license plates were stolen while my car was parked on a busy well lit road about 4 months ago in Magnolia.  It took a cop over 4 hours to come take my report.  I constantly find needles outside my apartment, in parks, etc. There was a huge rash of car break ins just about a year ago.  Is it violent crime?  No, but hey, no one wants to deal with any of that shit. 
Yes, there has been an increase of homeless people who have moved in to the area, and perhaps there is fair amount of pearl clutching associated with that.  Im sure there are a lot of ignorant people here that classify all homeless people as vagrants and criminals, but really, thats not exclusive to Magnolia.  Honestly Im really tired of hearing the stereotypes about Magnolia that is is all rich and white and crime free. There are a lot of really nice houses here, but there are also a lot of normal sized ones, apartments, older people on fixed incomes, college kids, etc.  
If people in Magnolia or Ballard want to hire a private security guard because it makes them feel safer, or prevents even a small amount of crime from happening, so be it.

"So, because there seems to be some misunderstanding about how this process works, here's a brief-ish explainer:

When someone gets arrested and appears to be in crisis, there are a several things that can happen. In some cases, a person can be transported to Harborview and evaluated, and may end up stay there on a 72 hour hold. In other cases, if there's reason to believe the person needs to be held at a more secure facility (based on the circumstances of an incident, past history or other factors) they can be booked into jail, where they can ALSO receive an evaluation by a King County mental health professional.

Depending on the results of that eval, judges, defense attorneys, prosecutors and jail staff can refer an individual's case to mental health court. More on that [here](http://www.kingcounty.gov/courts/district-court/regional-mental-health-court.aspx) and [here](http://www.seattle.gov/courts/comjust/mh.htm). 

This is all to say that being booked for a crime and receiving assistance for mental health issues are not mutually exclusive things.

"Wife and I close this weekend after three months of house hunting. We got outbid on three separate occasions before landing this one. Here's my $0.02:

(1) Get lucky: For some bizarre reason, we found sellers that took rolling offers. This allowed us to sneak in and lock-down the house before any weekend open-house frenzy. Our agent said that this was the first time he's seen this in 2-3 years and couldn't believe it. In summary, we submitted an offer within 36 hours of listing, and only had to compete with one other potential buyer. 

(2) Be nice and personable: I am super tall, and finding a house with high ceilings was really tough. My wife really appreciates history and craftsmanship, which is expensive. We wrote a letter talking about all these things, and how the home fit our dreams and needs. Writing a letter isn't about showing the sellers how cool/interesting you are. It's about praising the sellers for their style, and paying homage to the life they have built there. Finding anything that you have in common with the sellers is also clutch. For us, music was a big one (you'd be surprised how much info one can find with a quick Google search). Supposedly, our letter won us the house over another potential buyer who had counter offered 20K more. 

(3) Respect the market: Just accept the fact that things are crazy right now. There will almost always be someone willing to pay more than you. You can make things work in your favor though. A competitive offer is one without contingencies that includes a ""good faith"" deposit of about 25K. Get your mortgage and financial stuff worked out beforehand. Also, have an inspector that you know and trust on your speed dial, because when you find a house that you love, things will have to move crazy fast. 

(4) Get a good agent, but trust your own instincts and research. Set up a Redfin account and get automated updates/alerts on new listings. About 50% of the time, we knew about a listing before our agent. A good agent is one who knows the market and who is willing to see a house at the drop of a hat. 

(5) Understand that there are ""diamonds in the rough."" Just because a good looking, well-built house doesn't have a stainless steel stove top or a vintage farmhouse sink, doesn't mean it's not worth considering. The cost of remodeling/decorating is null compared to the sums of money people are offering above asking price for a completely remodeled house in Ravenna. 

(6) Understand that if you're looking in a hip/popular area, you will have to pay up to 100K above asking price. It sounds criminal, but it is the way it is. 

(7) Drainage, drainage, drainage. Amiright?!

The property owner.  Just because a building is vacant doesn't mean it isn't owned.

&gt;The owner couldn’t be reached for comment Wednesday. But Eric Guisasola of CG Construction, whom the owner hired to secure the building, said he and co-workers have been trying to secure it unsuccessfully for about a month.

Officials say there simply isn’t enough time in off-hours to handle all the repairs required.** The only option, they say, is for crews to do this work during the day. Trains will have to continue single-tracking through work zones. And this won’t be a short-term slowdown. The disruptions are likely to increase in the future, as the region grows and the infrastructure gets even older.

"Kind of figured those membership numbers were inflated and there'd be a large portion of people who wouldn't renew.  Especially when the ""data challenge"" didn't give granularity down to which users are actively using the system.

&gt;It also now appears (the council was bailing out Pronto) based on ridership (membership?) numbers that were overstated.

&gt;Seattle City Councilman Mike O'Brien repeated that Monday, March 14: ""We have over 3,000 members to the system today."" It was a statistic cited by his colleague Debora Juarez in an email a day later, when she told supporters, ""Three thousand yearly members of our bike share system would be left without service had the council voted against Pronto, and the city would have been obligated to repay $1 million in federal grant monies"".  Juarez and O'Brien both argued, successfully, membership was part of the overall equation in the bailout.
 
&gt;However, on Tuesday, the general manager of Motivate, which is running Pronto, admitted membership is much, much lower.  Demi Allen, in an email to KING 5, acknowledged **current membership is closer to 1,900,** writing, ""We'll be working hard to win back members who have chosen not to renew over the past few months during this period of uncertainty.""

Also, you could have gifted the bikes to another city and not had to repay the grant.

I guess someone could call this legislation back with a [referendum to the voters](http://www.seattle.gov/Documents/Departments/Clerk/2015%20Referenda%20Guide_final.pdf), although it would take 16,000 signatures in 29 days so that's more than a passive effort.
