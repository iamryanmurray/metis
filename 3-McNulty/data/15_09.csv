"Indeed, and there's no shittier way to get money.  So many things wrong with these tolls:

* They are horribly inefficient in terms of how much the actual collecting of the tolls cost, which means we're paying more to generate less funding.  

* Those who pay more have better access to government services, while everyone who is poor is actually made to experience worse services than before.

* The WSDOT generates more money the worse the general highway lanes perform.

* Two person carpools, who are still cutting cars on the road by half, are punished here for no good reason other than to generate more funds.

* Apparently there are a ton of cars that have metalized windshields for whom the passes (which can also identify you as a carpool) simply don't work.

Of course he doesn't find evidence of ""race"" being involved in the shooting - it's Olympia. The local newspaper, The Olympian, has attempted to reduce criticisms of the police and support for Andre Thompson and Bryce Chaplin by printing the minor arrest records of the two brothers in its May 23, 2015 edition. This is totally irrelevant.

The local media immediately put out smear campaigns of the boys to devalue their personal worth and further justify the cop's shooting of them.

You are largely right, Atlanta has historically been a god awful place for pedistrians and bikers. There is a lot to take away from the failings of MARTA. In no particular order these are the things that I have found important:

* The hub (5 points) became trashy and avoided by most people.
* Expansion into the suburbs was shut down because the suburbs were afraid there was going to be commuter crime.
  * This was largely possible because of how many different voting counties Georgia has, most suburbs have their own county and strong authority to reject MARTA expansion
* Leadership of MARTA had to constantly try and run in the black. This is a falacy because their competitor, the roads, constantly run in the red.

More like ""Neo-Mafia"" exaggerated machismo, a code by which you cannot show even the slightest sign of weakness.  Further, I've talked to many from Thailand, Laos, Vietnam - ""gangster"" culture is idealized in dime store novels and movies.  Lost count of the guys from SE Asia I've talked to who grew up dreaming of a violent type of ""Robin Hood"" lifestyle.

Its not a race thing, its a gender thing: environments where men have little to aim for, so they end up in the extreme macho crime culture, where they learn that verbal slights justify violent response.

"They did a terrible job with this article but the point still stands. 

These things are notorious for breaking down. One lost steering and was hit by a barge killing 2 in Philadelphia. 

One caught on fire in London.

Two sank in Liverpool. 

A bearing collapsed on one injuring passengers in 2010. 

They are also 80% blind spot with distracted drivers. They have been in three accidents in Seattle alone where the driver has stated they did not see the vehicle they hit. One case being a motorcyclist that was dragged by the duck boat. 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_tour

Anyone who lives or works along their route has likely seen them breakdown on more than one occasion. They clearly aren't maintained to be safe, they are maintained just enough to run everyday, all day during the summer.

As it is continuing to let them operate in this manner is just another accident waiting to happen. They need to A) have a separate tour guide and driver and B) some kind of over sight or regulation about the maintenance and use of the vehicles

San Francisco passed a law requiring them to have a separate tour guide. They shut down instead, something tells me San Francisco tourism has survived. 

They need to be checked by outside mechanics who can deem them unsafe to operate. Something tells me if their in-house guy says 'I'd like to take a closer look at this one during the day tomorrow' he doesn't get a super supportive response from management who hears 'We may lose three full tours worth of revenue because I want to 'look' at something'

I'm going to be very interested in the investigation as to how, as eye witnesses have described, the front wheel came off.

"In my own opinion, some of this on One Reel. They couldn't keep the fireworks show going without demanding a half million from the public. Eventually gave it up and sent it onto Seafair who has put on a better show. I believe it was even less than what One Reel required. I can't find the exact article that stated how much Seafair needed. But I know it wasn't a half million.

Now One Reel was almost bankrupting Bumbershoot. Unable to pay previous debts and racking up more. One thing they did to keep crowd control costs down, was to keep the ticket price high.  Fewer people, but paid more. Same income, but less expense on crowd control.   I'm not sure how well the new alliance with AEG will turn out. BUT they have paid off all the debts that One Reel owed.  Now AEG can use their music connections to bring in big name ""anchor"" bands and  *IN THEORY* bring in more efficient manner of running the festival. 

Will AEG make it more expensive? I dunno.  But I have always suspected that One Reel was not running things properly. Of course these are my own suspicions and have no facts to back it up.

"Am cop, will provide a little insight.

While I'm not involved with this case, from the article it is obvious that the ""seller"" could not be charged with theft because they cannot prove that he is the one who stole the tires. Trafficking stolen property required the burden of proof that the seller knew the property was stolen, which again is very difficult to prove. That leaves possession of stolen property (this case sounds like it would be second degree, a class C felony). Slightly lower burden of proof required, but still a charge that has to be filed by a detective. When police suspect someone of a felony but cannot prove it on the spot it is often forwarded to a detective who will then file the charges. Depending on the situation, suspect is either summoned for trial or gets a warrant issued. If they skip trial, warrant is issued either way.",,,,Krankjanker,,,1441724450,t5_2qhad,t3_3k23kk,t1_cuu8j74,22,1444236976,0,0,cuugjvh,Seattle,22,,

"As others have mentioned, this is available for *all* state employees.

I wish more people would openly discuss their pay at work. Having it kept as some dirty little secret only helps the employer and a very select few who are good at negotiating and switch jobs often. You can *not* be fired for doing this.

Having worked in a job with open salary information, it can certainly be a source of frustration/jealousy from workers knowing that others with similar jobs have significantly higher pay despite identical experience and qualifications. From what I recall, this was *usually* due to oddities in how employees were classified (two different job titles doing nearly identical work) rather than straight up performance vs. pay. But without this knowledge, the under-paid employee would never have a clue in the first place.

Knowing what your coworkers make is a tremendous *asset* to the worker:

- It will quickly close any gender gap in pay
- Forces employers to pay *all* of their employees fairly
- It gives those who are not as good at negotiating their pay a more level playing field

"If I could send messages back in time I'd tell myself not to waste the $1000+ on shipping a car to Seattle that I ended up driving three times in a year before I sold it.


Sell the car, save the cash, and use it to help pay for the move.  Almost any furniture store will offer delivery, and Zipcar rents cargo vans large enough to carry a couch or mattress.

When people talk about needing a car in Seattle it's usually because they like to go out into the mountains and hike/camp/etc. every other weekend.  If that sounds like you, consider keeping the car.  Otherwise it will cost far more to keep than other options.  Do the math before you sell, but be honest with yourself about what you need.  Costs will include car payments (unless you paid cash), insurance, maintenance, gas (unless it's electric), registration and fees, parking, and tolls for bridges.


A First Hill to Downtown commute will probably be most pleasant on foot if you're able.  If you're working a daytime schedule you'll be walking past cars stuck in traffic and won't have to pay for parking (which runs $200-300/mo downtown).  This area is also well-served by transit, so you'll see buses every 5-10 minutes during peak hours.

As far as other options, you'll have:

- Public transit (buses, light rail, and streetcar) for trips in the city and to nearby towns.  People here gripe about transit, but one of the few things we all seem to agree upon is that it's easy to get from downtown to other places.  The transit system is basically a spoke-and-hub system with downtown in the center.  Oh, and I should mention that while not everyone on public transit is a millionaire, the crowd is generally middle-class commuters, especially during the day.  It's generally a safe, quiet ride in the mornings and early evenings.

- Bikeshares that allow you to rent a bike by the half-hour if you don't have a bike and want to check out some trails.  Remember to wear your helmet- it's the law here.  It's also legal to ride on the sidewalks (yield to pedestrians, though!)

- Car2Go smartcars that charge by the minute for quick trips.  A bonus is that you get to park for free in any legal parking spot without paying and just leave the car there, making this a good option for one-way trips.

- Zipcar rentals that function more like a normal rental car with several types of vehicles available at spots around your neighborhood.  You do have to return the car to its original spot, but don't have to pay for gas (a gas card is included in the rental), which makes it nice for longer trips outside the city.

- Taxis, and their more technologically advanced cousins Uber/Lyft/Sidecar, which are like taxis you call and pay for via a smartphone app.  Based on my experience you should be able to get one of these to pick you up within about 5 minutes in First Hill or downtown unless it's the 4th of July or the Superbowl or something, in which case traffic will be so awful that you're better off walking.

- And, as /u/somenewuser points out, you can get virtually anything delivered in the city via AmazonFresh, Safeway Delivery, Postmates, BiteSquad, 2goservices, trycaviar, munchery, etc.


And while there may not be grocery stores very close to home, you'll be able to get to/from places like Pike Place Market and Uwajimaya with a bag of groceries pretty quickly via bus, so any specialty items or last-minute things you need to pick up for dinner won't be out of reach.


One final note, of you decide to give up the car, check out the /r/lowcar sub.  They tend to be anti-car, but once you see things like a guy moving a piano by cargo bike in Indiana, you'll see that it's not so hard to not own a car.  Plus they're a great resource and very supportive if you have questions about how to do things without a car.

Three months later I get a letter from a tow company. They had towed it and impounded it. *Then sold it*. They had NOT notified the cops or sent me a letter notifying me it was towed. Just the letter saying they had sold it.

I hired a lawyer and went to court. Turns out if the tow company fails to notify the cops or the owner (me) there is almost NO LEGAL RECOURSE. By law, you have 10 calendar days to get before a judge and contest the whole thing. For 10 days neither I nor the cops knew where the car was! 

The judge even stated during the trial the tow company had basically committed a crime, and I should be entitled to the full cost of the car, but under WA law tow companies are immune to most lawsuits and legal action.

I encourage parents, stakeholders, and interested members of the Seattle community, to please contact the school district about your desire for a strong and fair contract for teachers and all employees at Seattle Public Schools.

Here are the major issues as outlined by the staff at Lawton Elementary and published by our amazing Lawton Elementary School PTA (with some of my edits.)

In July, the state legislature released $40 million to the Seattle School District. The SEA members believe this money should be used to:

1. Establish caseload caps for providers of special services (such as school psychologists, speech-language pathologists, physical therapists, etc.) Without these caps students cannot receive all of the instructional support they need to be successful in school. The SEA wants to have caps on the numbers of students these specialists are required to work with. SPS rejected this proposal.

2. Guarantee ample and equitable recess time for all students across the district. Research shows unstructured physical activity positively impacts student learning. Recess time varies for K-5 kids across the district from 15 minutes to 45 minutes. The SEA wants at least 30 minutes for every K-5 student. SPS rejected this proposal.

3. Establish Race and Equity teams district-wide to address disproportionate discipline actions. These teams would focus on developing strategies across the district and within each school to reduce the disproportionate discipline of students of color with other students. SEA wants 30 schools to have teams this year. SPS wants 6 schools to have these teams.

4. SEA proposed to eliminate the student growth rating as part of teacher evaluations. This measure has never been shown to produce better results, plus it is an unfair evaluation measure that only uses test results for teachers of tested subjects. (For example, upper elementary teachers are evaluated using this measure but not our lower elementary, PE, or music teachers.) SPS rejected this proposal.

5. SPS has asked to lengthen the school day with no clear plan of how this would be done. SEA is happy to have this conversation and is willing to work more time (kids need it), but only if it is compensated and clear what the goal of the extra time is. Unfortunately, this proposal was brought to the table with very little detail and without a commensurate pay raise. SPS is asking teachers to work longer hours for free and they had no plan for what that meant for all the other people in the building (secretaries, Instructional Aids, Therapists, Nurses, etc.) SEA would entertain negotiating those details for the next contract.

6. SEA proposed to lessen the workload that schools' office staff is asked to do beyond their contractual time either through overtime compensation or increased hiring. SPS rejected this proposal.

7. SEA proposes a 6% increase in pay across the board for all employees for each of the next 3 years. This increase in compensation reflects the dramatic rise in the cost of living in Seattle, our ability to attract and retain high-quality educators and also takes into consideration that educators have not had a raise in 6 years. SPS proposed %2.0, %3.0, %3.5 increases in the the next three years.

None of us wants to strike, however we feel passionate that these proposals will positively impact student learning across the district.",,,,FleeFlee,,,1441377062,t5_2qhad,t3_3jkks5,t3_3jkks5,71,1444167662,0,0,cuqfzkg,Seattle,71,,

"That implication is wrong. It's been ingrained into us by a decade of crappy sensationalist news that feeds the fear train.

Edit: And your analogies are atrocious. Firefighters and medical practitioners are people whose *jobs* it is to fight fires or treat wounds.

Per hour it might sound decent, but as a living wage in Seattle it isn't great. Also a salary of 54k for someone with a master's degree and 5 years of experience doesn't appear to be a great return on investment. 

Perhaps the question shouldn't be, ""Do teachers get paid enough per hour?"" but rather, ""Is it worthwhile to be a teacher in Seattle?""  

I'm all for just paying them more for the time they already put in because I really respect the importance of teachers in society. However, perhaps we could extend school day length, or number of days, or find some other method by which we can justify paying teachers a salary that lets them live just above comfort level in Seattle.

If our bar is one time the cops got it right, as if that justifies the times they get it fatally wrong, you've got the wrong definition of toxic. 

At some point, using token individual voices of people from marginalized and oppressed groups to invalidate the overwhelming aggregate experience of those groups has to be seen for the bullshit it is. 

Bigots and apologists love to trot out their Ben Carsons and Allen Wests as if that is a magic shield against the aggregate reality and visible, statistical disparities in the experiences of marginalized and oppressed populations, specifically people of color. As if one person parroting their bullshit nullifies centuries of data. ""WE FOUND A BLACK GUY THAT HATES BLM. POST THAT SHIT EVERYWHERE.""

Phoenix is entitled to his opinion, certainly, but as an individual. Holding him up as an example of how ""even Black people hate BLM lol"" is deflection, and relies on the racist trope that all Black people are a monolithic bloc that can then be dismantled by individual voices of dissent. 

We have had a plague of homophobic and transphobic attacks on the Hill in the last few years, this Summer especially, and the reforms mandated by the DOJ have yet to be implemented, and we still have the MOST regressive tax structure (which affects LEO funding and reliance on surplus military tactics and hardware) in the Nation. One dude with a narcissistic hero complex doesn't change any of that. 

BLM is working to improve safety and demand accountability for everybody - police violence affects Whites too. Demanding that they do so in a way comfortable to the status quo is bullshit, and tokenizing individuals to erase the aggregate is bullshit, and demanding that everyone involved be a perfect avatar of their movement is bullshit. 

If we want change for the better in this city, we're going to have to suck it up and support those who are changing it. Yes, there are many fine officers in the SPD - a majority, I'd wager - and it's great that this went down without tragedy. As many do on the daily that go unreported and unnoticed.

But until we can expect this every time, and until we can expect that any time it goes sideways there is oversight and real justice, the residents of this town have every right to expect that racial profiling, racial harrasment, excessive use of force, and bad shootings swept under the rug are still the status quo.

The worst BLM can be is mildly annoying. Police violence is deadly. Not sure why there's a question of where our priorities should be. ",,,,teebalicious,,,1443115135,t5_2qhad,t3_3m6cjf,t3_3m6cjf,11,1444557646,1,0,cvcrdqd,Seattle,11,,

"I'd be cautious about reading the TRS-1 benefits. [That applies to very few teachers currently working](http://www.drs.wa.gov/member/systems/trs/definition.htm), as I think most teachers in the system started a *bit* after October, 1977.

But yes, those teachers in TRS-1 that made $86,000 per year for two consecutive years would retire at an annual benefit of $34,400 per year.

Under TRS-2 (the system most teachers are in), that teacher would have to earn $86,000 per year for 5 consecutive years. 

Of course, to earn $86,000 in the system you have a Ph.D and have worked there for 15 years. Probably not too many of them.

Now, the idea that this is somehow a massive payment really just shows how far our ideas of retirement earnings have fallen. Let's imagine a teacher ready to retire at age 65, next month, with that Ph.D, and 20 years of service: earning $34,400 from pension and $22,452 from Social Security = $56,852 per year.

"quoting my response to PhuckSJWs here.
I'm not sure what you think a better way to resolve the issue would be, when the district refuses to come to the table or negotiate a long overdue contract renewal.

&gt; here's why they couldn't: the district says that they have been negotiating since may, however the district was literally a no-show at many negotiating meetings. the union made multiple proposals on a lot of different issues which were sitting in the districts hands for months and were all summarily rejected just a couple of weeks ago. there is no way for teachers to strike in the summer because the work they're doing doesn't involve teaching (it's planning and training) and also, the union and the district were supposed to be negotiating a new contract. the old contract expired this week or last week, so there was hope that the union and the district would come together on a contract.
&gt; 
&gt; If you want to blame somebody, try the district who has refused to move on anything for the past few months while denying teachers cost of living increases for the past 6 years. And now they're offering an 8% pay increase over three years while asking teachers to start working 7% more (an extra 30 min/day) starting next year. Would YOU work longer hours in the hopes that in three years you'd be back to the same wages you started with?
&gt; 
&gt; Or, if you don't want to blame the district, blame the union who were such horrible negotiators (or corrupt/stupid) that they forced teachers into the exact contract that the district offered two years ago.
&gt; 
&gt; But I can't see any reasonable way that you could blame the teachers for this.

"OK, let's slow down and think about this from a statistical point of view.  Given how many people live here, and the rate at which the population grows, why would Seattle drivers be any better or worse than others?  
  
It's not an intrinsic quality of drivers here, as population flow and size rule that out.  So that leaves two options:  culture, and roads.  
  
The driving culture here is infamously polite and non-aggressive. Certainly not impossible for that to cause problems, but it doesn't seem like the glaringly obvious answer.  
  
The roads here were largely built for a city that has roughly a quarter of our current population.  Traffic is snarled every day, regardless of weather.  The roads don't have the capacity for the number of people living here, which seems like a much more obvious cause of accidents.  
  
Can we please stop bitching about how Seattle drivers are terrible (while, of course, patting ourselves on the back for being better than the rest of them) and instead talk about what we actually can do to improve the situation?",,,,SnortingCoffee,,,1441123480,t5_2qhad,t3_3j8542,t3_3j8542,15,1444110113,0,0,cun3yh9,Seattle,15,,

"&gt;A woman whom the world forgot

What does it mean to not be 'forgotten?' I am not homeless, but no one outside of my friends, family, and coworkers know me either. The world does not know me either. Was I supposed to know her? I think her death was tragic, but I dont see how I hold responsibility for her life either, or that I am in some way at fault for her being homeless.

&gt;Whose life never mattered until it made the news

How do we define when your life ""matters?"" What does that even mean? Millions of people around the world die every day and don't make the news, and nearly none of us knew them. 7 Billion people on the planet. Who is assuming that her life didn't matter any more or any less than the rest of us on this planet?


This is a horrible tragedy that this poor woman did not deserve. I understand that her friends are hurting quite badly over this. But I dont understand what they really mean or what they're really asking for by saying that she did not matter to non-homeless people, or that we should have not ""forgotten"" her. Perhaps they just mean more free housing, and more free mental health care? I dont know. I get the feeling that the sign conveys, but I dont understand the practical meaning.

"Shout out: to seattle schools special services personnel.  Part of this negotiation that regularly gets ignored it case limits for special services school psychologists, occupational therapists and speech and language pathologist who very often get overloaded.  Because there are no case limits many children are extremely under served when it comes to services that affect their education.  

The way things are now the district will just arbitrarily add children to peoples work loads.  They are not interested in whether or not they are helping the kids just that the paperwork is done so that they can say the kids have been assigned.  Many very hard working people that want to help kids are simply having to do the ""least"" amount they can in order to handle the overload of work they are given.  

That means that kids don't get helped and the district doesn't care because they are just filling out paper work.  Then when they get sued over neglecting special education it's all about pointing fingers.

"Uh, that 'minimum-speed-limit' thing gets repeated all the time, but it's a bogus claim.  

Fact is, the transportation network serves all legal users.  And that includes bicyclists.  Douchebags on bikes are getting equal treatment: The ability to use the transportation network, same as all the other users.  

Cops have far, far better things to do than ticket slow drivers anyway.  Stand next to a busy four-leg intersection with multiple lanes in each direction; watch it for several cycles.  Observe how many vehicle drivers break the laws -- by making right-turns-on-red without stopping, by running the red light, just plain speeding, tailgating, and other violations.  

My point is that it's a moot point that cyclists may break some laws, because far, far more car drivers break far, far more laws all the damn time.

"short version: This agent is an asshole, who can get fucked.

long version:

Fences often have shared responsibility when they ride the property line ( which is legal guide line you can pay to have defined with markers, but not a physical buried object), but in lieu of you knowing it without a survey, it's a little vague.

The note from the real estate agent is really what clears you here. They are acknowledging that the fence was yours, and they threw it away, so their listed property looked better. Which some people would consider theft of your property.

I would let them know they will be receiving no payment from you, and if they fail to drop the matter. You might considering wanting the fence back, or consider reporting it stolen, and or taking them or the owner ( oh man a judgement lien would really screw up a sale) to small claims for the replacement.

1) When Xi lands in Seattle, the welcoming committee will be led by former Washington state governor Gary Locke, who also served as U.S. ambassador to China. Locke will be joined by Microsoft (MSFT, Tech30) CEO Satya Nadella and Starbucks (SBUX) CEO Howard Schultz.


2) Later, Xi will attend a banquet hosted by local politicians and business leaders. The Chinese president will deliver a speech on Sino-U.S. relations at the event, which, according to the Seattle Times, will be held at the Westin Hotel with former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in attendance.


Wednesday, Sept. 23


1) Xi is scheduled to attend a business roundtable co-hosted by the Paulson Institute. The group's founder, former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, built and maintained close ties with Beijing during his career at Goldman Sachs.
The Paulson Institute says it has invited 15 Chinese CEOs to participate, along with 15 U.S. CEOs.
According to official Chinese state media, invited U.S. companies include Hyatt (H), Pepsi (PEP), General Motors (GM), Honeywell (HON), DuPont (DD), Microsoft (MSFT, Tech30), Boeing (BA), Amazon (AMZN, Tech30), IBM (IBM, Tech30), Starbucks (SBUX), Apple (AAPL, Tech30), Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA), Disney (DIS), Cisco (CSCO, Tech30) and Dow Chemical (DOW).
China will be represented by tech giants Baidu (BIDU, Tech30), Tencent (TCEHY), Lenovo (LNVGF) and Alibaba (BABA, Tech30), as well as ICBC, Bank of China and Haier, among others.


2) According to the office of Washington Governor Jay Inslee, Xi will travel to Lincoln High School in Tacoma, reprising a trip the Chinese president made in 1993, when he was Communist Party chief of the port city of Fuzhou.


3) The New York Times reports that Xi will attend the U.S.-China Internet Industry Forum, an annual event that is being held this year to coincide with Xi's visit. China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not yet confirmed that Xi will take part in the summit.


4) Xi will visit Boeing's factory in Everett, Wash. on Wednesday. Boeing chairman Jim McNerney will be on hand to welcome Xi, along with CEO Dennis Muilenburg and Boeing Commercial Airplanes CEO Ray Conner.
Boeing, which has played a major role in developing China's aviation industry and infrastructure, produces the 747-8, 767, 777 and 787 Dreamliner at the Everett factory. According to Boeing, China will need an estimated 6,330 new airplanes over the next 20 years, a haul worth $950 billion.

"As someone who holds a Texas teaching certificate (wait, do I? Silly thing might have expired last month) but lives in Seattle and doesn't teach any longer, I think your finances are going to hurt.  The districts that pay well--though most of them here do pay better in comparison to the shitty starting salaries back in D/FW--are going to be in or near to the city.  That means that housing is going to be your biggest expense (food will be your next-largest cost).  Almost every teacher I know up here either has a spouse who works at a job that pays 1.5x of a teacher's salary or the teacher is on his or her 25th year of teaching and owns a house on the lake that they bought in 1979 when everyone was bailing out of Puget Sound as fast as the moving trucks could carry them.  I hope your spouse makes decent money if you want to have a good commute between where you live and where you teach. *Edited to add:* Looking at your post history, you assuredly will not pay $130k-150k for a house here.  Just about triple that if you want to be less than an hour from most of the good districts, though it is possible to find 1 and 2 bedroom apartments for about $1,500 per month in and around the city and then take transit to work.

&gt; -Do your certifications expire or are they lifetime?

The Resident certificate is three years with a couple of two year renewals before the teacher will likely have moved to the Professional cert which is, I think, valid for five years (renewable with CLEs).  The certs are a bit confusing to me.

&gt; -Do you have unions? If so, has there been a big history of strikes/unrest between labor and admin? 

Yes.  Seattle Public Schools is on strike right now.  Teachers in Bellevue were on Strike a few years ago.

&gt; -What's the state testing situation like? Are there assessments every grade level or are there only certain grades tested? 

Yes, but there has been a lot of pushback here over them, especially at the high school level.  Teachers at Garfield High School--in Seattle--walked out recently rather than give the battery of tests.",,,,somenewuser,Central Area,,1442167872,t5_2qhad,t3_3kt2t8,t3_3kt2t8,12,1444338344,0,0,cv08ak5,Seattle,12,,flair

"Look north my friend.  While the Seattle area struggles with a transit system,  we do have a commuter train (The Sounder) that stops in three different towns: Edmonds,  Mukilteo,  and Everett. All of these are on the Puget Sound. 

Edmonds is the nearest,  it's beautiful community with a true downtown.  It's  typically an older community, being that home values are strong.  Low crime and good schools.  I grew up there. 

Mukilteo is suburb that is just West of the Boeing Everett plant. Great schools,  lots of neighborhoods,  but it lacks a central hub.  They have a water front,  but honestly I think it's a little chaotic as it's split in the middle by ferry traffic.  

Everett is that old car in your neighbor's driveway that has potential to be fixed up,  but he's just not quite had the money to do so.  That said, he just got a better job.  With the higher prices in Seattle,  more people are looking to Everett.  It has a blue collar history and has its share of crazy people.  It's a big town,  so you can find neighborhoods as well as downtown living.  I'd suggest you look in the Rucker Hill area or Northwest Everett.  These have really cool older homes and for a fraction of Seattle.

edited to add: That ""solid white line"" is actually the section of ground away road where they *removed* the old lane marking. It's not a lane marking. I know it looks like one because it is lighter color than the road around it, but it is not a lane marking. The right lane on 6th is supposed to pull in to the left lane on Aurora, and the 2nd lane from the right on 6th is a straight-only lane.

"Alaska, because they are better at handling customer issues that can happen with flying.  I fly between 40,000 and 80,000 mi a year.  Alaska is regularly the less shit-show compared to some others.  If I am flying Economy Domestic they are my first choice.  


If I were a wealthy person flying for fun it would probably be Virgin or Emirates, they just treat you to luxury more often.  You do pay for it though.  And neither airline does that well in service to Seattle.

Delta overseas first class looks nice.  Overseas Delta has treated me well in Economy+ .  I can't speak to their 29"" seat regular economy seats, won't use them, can't.  To that point, www.seatguru.com is a great resource to see whether your flight is going to give you a full 31"" or above leg room.  I discovered recently that many Asian airlines do not, particularly on Asia-Asia short-haul's.   

Delta domestic economy is garbage, in an MD-Deathbomb, 35 year old piece of shit plane they should have junked 20 years ago, puddle jumping you in 30 and 45 minute layovers that miss their connections half the time.  Can't say that enough.  Delta regularly puts people through cross-country link-ups that require 30 - 45 minute layovers to connect, these require you haul unholy ass through a big airport like MSP or DTT hoping the connection will wait so you're last on board and no space now for your carry-on.  And don't even mention trying to connect through ATL.  Delta *owns* ATL and yet they have flights scattered throughout the terminal with so little time to connect it's ridiculous, you're elbowing past all these hur dur tourists standing out in the hallway trying to buy a Big Mac, all the while needing 30 minutes to make the connection, and Delta's provided you with 15.

American I've had decent luck with, as an Alaska codeshare.  I try to avoid their US Air branded flights though.  US Air for years earned its reputation as the shittiest, most bellicose service going.  I doubt they fired all those people when American took over.

In general I try to fit my flight to the ""home team"" at that particular airport.  So in Seattle that means Alaska first choice, more flights, better service, better resources if something goes wrong.  Delta owns Atlanta, no getting around it, if you're going to Atlanta you're on Delta.  Same with Dallas and American, you get a whole terminal to yourself on American, where if you fly Alaska/Delta to DFW you're going to be landing in E31, sharing the space, having more risk of delays.

Southwest has its fans.  I do not like unreserved seating, but for those that are fine with it, Southwest treats its customers quite well for Domestic Economy.  As long as you fit in one seat.


tl, dr; Alaska out of SeaTac whenever possible, Delta or American otherwise, United has fewer flights than they used to, and if you don't mind non-reserved seats Southwest does treat its customers pretty well for Economy class.

when that wears thin, walk a couple blocks to bush garden for a good karaoke plus stabbing. 

there aren't many places left in seattle to get stabbed, or to perform a good stabbing. but those two places are definitely the right area. they both serve cheap whiskey and you'll meet some fantastic unique people who may or may not try and stab you.

"well for starters:  I've been hit by a car twice living here, while crossing during a ""walk"" sign.  both times they looked at me like ""what.""  In fact KILLING a pedestrian rarely has any consequence in NY or NJ.  

Everybody jaywalks constantly - not a little bit, but constantly.

Fireworks in NJ are a FELONY.  Thousand dollar fine.  My neighborhood of Jersey City was as bright as daylight on the 4th of July.  These people smuggled them in from Pennsylvania and then invited the neighborhood over to watch them commit a felony.  No consequence.  

Half the businesses in my neighborhood have no paperwork.  They don't exist.  Not in the phonebook, on google maps, no licenses posted or on record, nothing.  They just rent a commercial space and start selling tomatoes.  There's no enforcement, so they do it.

My GARBAGE MAN just got busted, finally, for refusing to take out trash for bars unless they gave him free booze.

"Actually, in the case of Teachers and Police, unions are almost specifically made to keep them in a healthy place. 

Both of these groups of people are faced with a sort of [monopsony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopsony).

 The unions (or guilds in the case of the police) are a way to organize the various skilled individuals that are competing to provide their services for the publics benefit. But since there is only one buyer, in this case the public school system, it's not a conventional market. That is to say that the principles of your typical open market where demand is nearly unlimited does not apply anymore.

Ultimately when there is only one buyer and many service providers there is too much power being focused in that one buyers hands. This buyer can pit the individuals with the desired skill sets against each other and achieve an unfair exchange value.

"&gt; Nothing, not mushrooms, not ferns, not moss, not melancholy, nothing grew more vigorously, more intractably in the Puget Sound rains than blackberries. Farmers had to bulldoze them out of their fields. Homeowners dug and chopped, and still they came back. Park attendants with flame throwers held them off at the gates. Even downtown, a lot left untended for a season would be overgrown. In the wet months, blackberries spread so wildly, so rapidly that dogs and small children were sometimes engulfed and never heard from again. In the peak of the season, even adults dared not go berry picking without a military escort. Blackberry vines pushed up through solid concrete, forced their way into polite society, entwined the legs of virgins, and tried to loop themselves over passing clouds. The aggression, speed, roughness, and nervy upward mobility of blackberries symbolized for Max and Tilli everything they disliked about America, especially its frontier.

&gt; Bernard Mickey Wrangle took a yum approach.

&gt; To the King, during tea, Bernard had advocated the planting of blackberries on every building top in Seattle. They would require no care, aside from encouraging them, arborlike, to crisscross the street, roof to roof; to arch, forming canopies, natural arcades, as it were. In no time at all, people could walk through the city in the downpouringest of winter and feel not a splat. Every shopper, every theater-goer, every cop on the beat, every snoozing bum would be snug and dry. The pale green illumination that filtered through the dome of vines could inspire a whole new school of painting: centuries from now, art critics might speak, as of chiaroscuro, of ""blackberry light."" The vine would attract birds. Woodpeckers might not bother, but many birds would. The birds would sing. A bird full of berry pulp is like an Italian full of pathos. Small animals might move into the arches. ""Look, Billy, up there, over the Dental Building. A badger!"" And the fruit, mustn't forget the fruit. It would nourish the hungry, stabilize the poor. The more enterprising winos could distill their own spirits. Seattle could become the Blackberry Brandy Capital of the World. Tourists would spend millions annually on Seattle blackberry pies, the discerning toast of the nation would demand to be spread with Seattle blackberry jam. The chefs at the French restaurants would dish up duck in purplish sauces, fill once rained-on noses with the baking aromas of *gâteau mûre de ronce*. The whores might become known, affectionately, as blackberry tarts. The teamsters could try to organize the berry pickers. And in late summer, when the brambles were proliferating madly, growing faster than the human eye can see, the energy of their furious growth could be hooked up to generators that, spinning with blackberry power, could supply electrical current for the entire metropolis. A vegetative utopia, that's what it would be. Seattle, Berry Town, encapsulated, self-sufficient, thriving under a living ceiling, blossoms in its hair, juice on its chin, more blackberries—and more!— in its future. Consider the protection offered. What enemy paratroopers could get through the briars?

&gt; The King's heart had rattled like spook chains in a horror show. Trembling, he had changed the subject to basketball.

"Public transportation means that it is for use by the public, not necessarily that it is publicly owned. 

**edit**

Holy cow, did I really just get to -8 in an hour for correcting an incorrect correction of a definition?

&gt;[public transport](http://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/public-transport)

&gt;noun [U] UK    US    UK (US public transportation)

&gt;1 a ​system of ​vehicles such as ​buses and ​trains that ​operate at ​regular ​times on ​fixed ​routes and are used by the ​public:

The *public* in *public transportation* refers to who uses it, not who owns it. There's nothing ""technically private transportation"" about Greyhound. It's for use by the general public; ergo, it's public transportation.

**edit 2**

Now that I'm sitting here editing my buried comment, I'll point out that the apparent popular confusion over what constitutes what public transportation actually *is* is a much stronger indicator of the poor state of public transit in the US than what /u/Koolaidstory said.

We use public funds to subsidize car ownership so much that for-profit privately-owned-and-operated public transit is mostly non-existent in the US, with the vast majority of public transit in the US being highly subsidized public entities. And in the vast majority of the US this is seen more as social welfare than as a legitimate option for the middle class (except for airplanes).

Thanks to this mindset, apparently it's difficult for people in this thread to even conceive of the possibility of for-profit privately-owned public transit--so much so that the very definition of the phrase ""public transit"" is apparently unknown.",,,,shoeson,,,1441853510,t5_2qhad,t3_3kbmoj,t1_cuwct8j,15,1444271647,0,0,cuwd9lp,Seattle,15,,

One of the findings that blew my mind when I first read it is that people who use substances as a way of dealing with everyday stress appear *more* likely to develop PTSD in response to a major trauma, perhaps because they are less adept at handling day-to-day life than those who are sober in response to it.

"They have to be at least 55 or served 30 years based on:

        Are at least age 55 and have at least 25 service credit years, or

"It's not really that crazy. It makes a *really* delicious and juicy turkey. After all, by frying it you cook the outside quickly and it traps all the moisture inside the bird. 

The general perception around deep frying also seems to be that it's a lot more unhealthy than it actually is. A lot of fried foods are grossly unhealthy (and delicious) because of what they are, not necessarily the way they're cooked. Deep frying *does* add more fats and calories, this is absolutely true, and also in part from breading/battering. But the idea that fat is bad for you is absurd. Fried meat isn't saturated in oil, the outside cooks immediately and seals off the inside. 

Of course, using a good oil to cook with makes a difference too. Olive oil, peanut oil, coconut oil, palm oil, lard, and tallow are all great choices. None of them start smoking at 350F (177C), which is your typical frying temp. They're all high in saturated or monosaturated fats, which basically keep them from breaking down at the high temperatures and keeps them stable longer. Generally speaking, they're pretty flavor neutral too. Coconut oil, lard, and tallow might add some extra flavor. Coconut oil is damn good for you, and animal fat crisps things really well and tastes good too.

Then there are a bunch of oils that are full of polysaturated fats and small amounts of transfats. Many people will use them to cook with because they can be cheaper. They're unstable and break down faster, so you end up with oxidized fatty compounds in your oil and food (probably some other nasty stuff too) that you would avoid by picking a proper oil. The ones to avoid are soybean, corn, canola, cottonseed, safflower, grapeseed, sunflow, sesame, and the most common, any and all cheap ""vegatable oil/""",,,,Apollinaire131,,,1441937722,t5_2qhad,t3_3kf1hj,t1_cuxedly,12,1444290860,0,0,cuxhcgw,Seattle,12,,

* [Median](http://slog.thestranger.com/slog/archives/2010/06/07/seattles-teachers-not-as-church-mousey-as-you-think) income for Seattle teachers is around $62,000. ""The average is skewed upwards to $70,850 because such a large percentage of teachers (I don’t have the exact proportion) are older teachers earning well over $80,000, up to the maximum of $88,463."" 

* [Base](http://www.kirotv.com/news/news/seattle-teacher-salaries-compared-other-districts/nZhrN/) pay for Seattle teachers is an average of $49,956 (no median values found for base pay).

* Using the base and total averages, Seattle falls in fourth place, in a group of 14 districts in the Puget Sound area.  Statewide, Seattle Public Schools falls in eighth place.

* First year teachers in Seattle make an average of $44k, and [mid-career](http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/education/wildly-varying-teacher-salaries-part-of-state-budget-debate/) teachers make average $59k.

Based on what comparative judgment? This is simply your opinion - with very little information or research backing it.

Many say they are scrambling to afford housing in a city where living expenses are rapidly increasing as tech giants like Amazon, Google and Facebook increase hiring in the area.

One of the sad side effects of tech-gentrification is that the support network that makes a community functional (such as education) is not likely to acquire similarly competitive wages.
 

Education is an intangible good and thusly hard to justify the wages similar to a field who has a tangible output.

Teaching could be as praised as technology work and paid well, if the society demanded it. The reality is many are apathetic to improving the lives of others when their own aren't immediately impacted.

"Lol, truthfully... I run red lights all the time. After leaving overseas for a period of time, I realized how stupid and inefficent stop lights are compared to round-a-bouts. It drives me a bit crazy sitting at a light waiting for it to turn when i'm the only car for miles and miles. If I can see in all directions and there is no oncoming traffic, I run it every time. AND I think that should be legal. Only ever recieved one ticket for running a red, which was dropped in court.

"&gt;we should give them their parking reservation - by charging them $100/day per spot. then it will guarantee only they can afford it. 

I like this idea but let's take it a step further.

Make 25 spots the ones ""anyone"" can purchase. Say the price is ""subject to demand and availability"" to ensure fairness. Watch as the inevitable bidding war starts. I would go so far as to make them like taxi medallions, so you could artificially create a market around these coveted 25 spots that will in all likelihood remain empty 75% of the time. With the sky high revenue due to the crazy bidding war/market I've created, I would dump it right back into the transit system and save up for building another round of underground garages or more lines or whatever.

"It doesn't make me sad, and here's why: Google extracts a lot of concessions from local governments before it will deploy its network.  Waived permitting fees, minimal franchise fees, free time from city staffers, no build-out requirements, and so on.  Google is worth billions; if it deems an area profitable, let it build its network on its own dime and not require that taxpayers fund a private system.  (This differs from municipal broadband: the city would own the network and reap the benefits from it.)

Also, many cable franchises--including the one just granted to CenturyLink and the one likely to be renewed with Comcast--contain ""most favored nation"" clauses, meaning that if any new entrant gets a better deal, those franchises automatically get that same deal.  This has already been shown with AT&amp;T getting all of the same freebies from the City of Austin that Google is getting.  I have even *less* interest in letting Comcast have a handout in addition to Google.

&gt;Under Title 23 of the United States Code (Highways), there is a general prohibition on the imposition of tolls on Federal-aid highways.

These programs allow tolling to generate revenue to support highway construction activities and/or enable the use of road pricing for congestion management. If Federal funds have been used or will be used on the highway, then the public authority responsible for the facility must qualify for toll authority under one of these Federal toll programs.

"Let me make a regulatory case without hard data for you:

1) The only known use for these vehicles is for tours, so any special value they have is based on their novelty, nor are they essential to the industry they are used in.

2) They have not been subjected to the regulations that effect new commercial vehicle designs for things like bumper heights and safety standards because the design predates the regulations, but these vehicles are still being built and maintained, so they are being kept on modern roads via a grandfathered exception to modern regulations that we make even essential vehicles meet- like ambulances.  

3) So we don't know much about how safe the design is, they haven't had the kind of testing or design we now require that allows us to judge things like this.

This results in a situation where a vehicle whose use is essentially frivolous is not having to meet safety standards for thing like bumper height when we require all kinds of essential vehicles to meet them.  If seems reasonable to require these vehicles to either meet modern safety standards to use modern roads OR to engage in the kind of testing that shows they preform in a way that makes them safe.  Grandfathered exceptions did not envision novelity use of ancient vehicles keeping them on the road, they were designed to keep people who had old work trucks from going out of business when a new standard was passed.  This is an unusual situation where the fleet isn't aging out of the exception and so we should consider lifting it because the current situation doesn't reflect the vaule we should put on road safety and the risk is minor- at worse an odd node of a small industry has to change their method of transport.",,,,vrimj,,,1443308723,t5_2qhad,t3_3mhfa6,t1_cvf5i7r,16,1444600665,0,0,cvf95ex,Seattle,16,,

"This has been debunked so many times.

Cyclists are often already car owners and drivers as well, who leave their paid-for motorized vehicles at home, using less of the road, causing less wear and tear, while paying for more than their share of the road.

Cyclists who aren't already car owners end up paying more for their share of road directly through property taxes, sales tax and indirectly through other means.

And cyclists don't need all of the traffic signs, lights and related road kit that cars do. All they need is a fairly smooth path a few feet wide that isn't muddy or deep sand/soil and very basic traffic control.

If you really wanted financial fairness and equity on the road you would pay by the ton per mile PLUS congestion/idling fees and gasoline/petroleum wouldn't be a protected and subsidized industry and you'd be paying 4-5x the price for gas BEFORE gas/vehicle taxes, just like most of the rest of the developed world.",,,,loquacious,,,1441746201,t5_2qhad,t3_3k4qok,t1_cuuu57n,21,1444243659,0,0,cuuulfu,Seattle,21,,

"The whole thing is a giant clusterfuck, as intended.

75% of the revenue goes to the Texas company that can't detect what a motorcycle is without a transponder, can't figure out a solution that works with metallic windshields, and is actively incentivized to ""accidentally"" toll people - because they get a cut!  Oh, but if you do suffer from that, you can call each time - or get a license plate transponder that doesn't let you use the lanes for free.  But, if you're not carpooling, you might pay the toll! ;)

And this is OK, because it's not about raising money from toll users - it's about driving enough of them out of the HOV lanes that the sweet, sweet federal highway money keeps flowing.  Since if your HOV lanes don't average 45mph, you don't get that sweet, sweet torrent of federal dollars.  So, you know, sending all that money from the idiots stupid enough to drive to Texas is perfectly reasonable!

"It's time for another review of how local voters have pretty consistently [voted down](http://seattlish.com/post/83663717975/on-blast-90-years-of-fucked-up-seattle-public) any efforts to make modern, functional, forwarding thinking programs to create transit and better transit infrastructure:

* In 1968, voters approved the Kingdome, but rejected transit  

* In [1970](http://www.seattletimes.com/business/economy/the-mass-transit-system-seattle-might-have-had-jon-talton/), voters rejected four transit-related bonds, causing the federal government to reroute transit aid to Atlanta instead of here.  

* In [1972](http://metro.kingcounty.gov/am/history/history-1970.html) voters allow a small transit tax for busses, but reject the tax for electric rail. (Even the meager vote for busses was the first time Seattleites approved new taxes for transit since 1918)  

* In [1995](http://metro.kingcounty.gov/am/history/history-1990.html), voters reject a Regional Transit Authority (later Sound Transit) measure for a gigantic, $6.7 billion transportation system over three counties that would’ve featured commuter rail, light rail, express buses, and expanded HOV lanes 

* In 1999, with Initiative 695, local voters show their love of Tim Eyman and regressivism- scrapping the progressive car excise fee for a super-regressive $30 state car tabs. Since 29% of the vehicle excise tax went to local transit, local communities have been scrambling to keep their buses running ever since. 

* In 2002, voters showed their hatred of forward-thinking transit/infrastructure funding and support an Eyman initiative yet again: voters approved I-776,which restricted local governments from adding their own excise taxes and limited local license tab fees. While the measure was shot down at first for being unconstitutional, it was upheld by the State Supreme Court in October 2003. 776 repealed many taxes that the public had [already voted on](https://researchcouncil.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/initiative776.pdf)  

* In [2005](http://www.seattlepi.com/local/transportation/article/Monorail-will-go-to-voters-for-5th-time-1183631.php), Mayor Nickels gets the ""all-or-nothing"" plan for a West Seattle-Ballard monorail on the ballot. The plan is a watered down, poor version of the original, so it failed. Its rejection gutted Seattle Monorail Partners, which had been working to upgrade our transit system since they were created by a public vote in 1997. Council President Jan Drago (accurately) expressed fear that not building the monorail segment means ""we will pass it to future generations."" **Now look where we are!** 

* In [2011](http://seattlest.com/2011/07/13/last_night_people_are_voting_with_t.php): The Congestion Reduction Fee. When our regressive and outdated sales tax revenue plummets during the recession – the King County Council approves a $20 fee on vehicle tabs to make up the $60 million deficit, collected in 2012  through 2014  

* In [2014](http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/with-transit-money-approved-seattle-pledges-to-spend-new-dollars-well/), Seattleites vote *FOR* maintaining some bus transit, with more regressive taxes - a $60 car-tab fee and a 0.1 percent sales-tax increase - to keep many bus lines from being cut and to expand services on a couple bus lines. 


Just think where we could be now if voters hadn't rejected mass transit on multiple occasions and hadn't supported regressive taxation and Tim Eyman's anti-transit, anti-infrastructure initiatives.

Nice and clean but generic.  And the area is surrounded by sprawl, suburbs and developments that go for miles.  

Seattle is more unique, a bit grittier, has different neighborhoods with different character.  Traffic sucks here too but the public transportation is better (downtown at least).  One thing about Seattle though is that character is changing, and fast in some places.  So ultimately we're going to be a lot more like Bellevue.

"I bailed out for the same reason. A UI similar to this would compel me to delete the app and just cross my fingers. 

I have commuted daily via the bus (route 41), gratefully using One Bus Away to coordinate my trips, although I'm not currently busing. I found that the worst type of inaccuracy wasn't whether the bus' arrival time was off by a few minutes, but when a ""phantom bus"" would not show up at all for a scheduled stop (usually after a progressively increasing delay shown on One Bus Away). Similarly, some buses would not register on One Bus Away but would show up on time anyway. I feel that +/- 5 minutes is reasonable; someone could need to (dis)embark with a wheelchair at any stop and skew the predicted arrival time. 

These seem to resemble issues with the GPS equipment tracking a particular bus (which could be fouling up a different route the next day) rather than the minute-by-minute per-stop accuracy your project is addressing... I don't mind showing up to my stop a few minutes early and demonstrating a modicum of personal responsibility :p

"&gt; Actually yes, you can. Looking at WA tax policy, the systematic singling out of users of particular tools and services is done deliberately due to our system of use-taxes. Now this instance of use tax is most likely at odds with the second amendment, obviously, but its gonna take this lawsuit to really sort that out and I look forward to seeing that debate play out in the courts.

Actually, no, you cannot. And this does not have anything to do with 2nd Amendment - and everything to do with WA RCW 9.41.290 - ""The state of Washington hereby fully occupies and preempts the entire field of firearms regulation within the boundaries of the state, including the registration, licensing, possession, purchase, sale, acquisition, transfer, discharge, and transportation of firearms, or any other element relating to firearms or parts thereof, including ammunition and reloader components."" (http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.290).

&gt; Also glad taxes aren't footing the bill.

You shouldn't be glad. First, because in the end, as the lawsuit progresses and starts costing more and more (and start being more and more embarrassing - https://www.preciseshooter.com/blog/SeattleVMath.aspx), pro-bono law firms will drop out and the city will have to pay for it. Second, because this law uncovers the general quality of decision making in Seattle City Hall. That second part is far more scary, because it transcends guns.

&gt;  If you're buying guns you are regardless of your use subsidizing guns and ammo for the illegal market when your legal gun gets stolen and used in a crime downtown.

That's bullshit. Alcohol kills more people. Seattle does not have a city-specific alcohol tax.

&gt; This at least sets up an insurance policy of sorts for the collateral fallout of innocent bystanders and victims for not securing your guns.

It doesn't. The law makes operating a gun store infeasible in Seattle, and all significant gun dealers already said that they will move. Seattle will lose, not make the money if this law was actually allowed to stand. It is impossible to compete with tons of dealers just outside Seattle if you have to pay 25-40% tax on the most popular items, and they don't.

&gt; I'm proud to live in a city where our politicians are willing to attempt to find new solutions to very old problems.

You should not be. City leaders lied about math (300-500k revenue prediction is PURE bullshit, and they know it), City Attorney lied about legality (really? a 40% tax which runs gun stores out of the city and is not actually making tax revenue is not a regulation?), all this so Burgess could buttress his ""liberal"" creds for an election? I am not sure which planet you're even from, calling this a ""solution""...

&gt; All the same tons of research has shown OVER AND OVER, locally, nationally, and internationally that more guns is strongly correlated with more gun crimes and deaths(suicide, murder, etc).

That's just COMPLETE bullshit.

First, internationally, the countries with the most murders are also the ones with the low firearms availability and the most firearms regulations. Here, Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate. US is #111, Russia is #66, it is IMPOSSIBLE to buy a gun in Russia. US gun violence is higher than other countries in its income bracket, but this is ONLY because US level of inequality is also enormous - US is essentially two countries in one: a very poor nation with high violent crime rate, and a very rich nation with a very low violent crime rate. If you compare crime rate by locality and correct for income, you will quickly discover that for example Bellevue and Medina are very similar in gun crimes to similar areas in Western Europe.

Second, correlation != causation. Harvard Injury Control Research Center, the primary anti-gun ""research institution"" admits as much. Murders and gun ownership also correlate with low income (high incidence of blue collar and farmer jobs where guns are the tools of the trade or family pastime - which also happen to be low income occupations). The causation between poverty and violence is far more likely than causation between guns and violence.

Finally, this specific legislation has nothing - absolutely nothing - to do with actually reducing the crime rate. You can still buy the ammo on the Internet, or outside Seattle, where vast majority of gun shops are. You can still buy guns outside Seattle. This has not chance of affecting either gun ownership rates, nor availability of guns to criminals.

"&gt; I think the major problem we have in this area right now

No I think you hit on it before.

&gt;When you basically check out of life and wind up living in the middle of an urban area without a job or a roof over your head, you've created a situation for yourself

**You've** created a situation **yourself** 

Despite the screaming protest of the wealthy, causality hasn't been turned on its head. No human being is an island, if you wonder why humans have such insane behavior problems compared to other animals. You just need to look at caged animals instead.

Our modern world is not entirely compatible with tribal life. Where our biological processes moved with social progress. It's no coincidence that we release a chemical to facilitate working together. We are biologically adapted to work together. It's not just a luxury, it's a need. Humans not given contact as infants will die, even if everything else is accounted for.

What we have is a society that has mastered and remastered unending technologies. But we fail to understand ourselves as complex.

I'm in therapy for post traumatic stress disorder... changing behavior is hard. Like next to fucking impossible by chance. You need to understand clearly how your behaviors developed, why they developed, and how to develop them further into something new. When I work with therapists and pay people money to help, they never tell me to blame myself or my choices. They always drill down to find out why I originally adopted the behavior. It's never ever ever ever about what behavior choices I make. My therapists aren't coddling me, it's tough work. They understand much better than the average person how behavior works.

&gt;I disagree with most posters on it somehow being societies or Seattles problem.

That's great but you can't tell me 2+2=5 because you believe it in your gut. You need proof. All modern theories on behavior point to it being bigger than an individual. Without resources and compassion it's simply stupid to expect change.

&gt;If we could find a way to help a significant portion of these people back into productive members of society

How about you treat them like humans and not vermin trying to steal your food?

But we don't do that. We look at rats and other pests with disdain as well. Who gives a shit they took millions of years to evolve and are simply carrying out their genetic program. They stand in the way of what humans think the world should look like so kill them with impunity.

You find that people think they have a better idea on how things should be acting then they really do. The impoverished really are helpless in many ways and those that do manage to make it through do so based purely on chaos theory. There are so many people in poverty of course some of them will make it out.

We don't agree with the concept of life though. We believe in a story that says the Earth was made to be conquered by people. We can keep learning and defeating the natural processes. Things can be however we say they are and we don't have to bend to reality.

It's actually attitudes like the one above that keep these problems going. Refusing to accept societies roll in the problem. It can't possibly be everyone's fault all at once. It must be the individuals fault. What a fucking stupid notion. How do you think consciousness even comes to be? If you raised a baby without any culture what would it be like? A feral child! Our humanity and consciousness is imprinted on us from the society we are born into. How the living hell do you come to the conclusion personal choice is the end determining factor? It's insane! there is no fucking evidence for it!

No instead it's cognitive dissonance. Because if the poor really can't help themselves... well then the rich are massive massive assholes. If it's true the poor actually need our help then the good times are done. We have to stop pretending the world is ruleable by us. And that means that everyone who has pursued personal wealth over helping their neighbor eat is a terrible person.

Of course you want to tell me it's personal responsibility. It's so much nicer if it was true. Then we can say ""Who cares, they did this to themselves"" and we don't have to change the way we live.

It's why the wealthy need to be reminded. Because by being a wealthy human you might mistakenly come to believe you got yourself there. It wasn't where you squeezed your way out from. It's who you are as a person. The reason the wealthy believe this and act the way they do, is because personal responsibility doesn't exist. If it did then the wealthy would help the poor of their own accord. But they come to learn through living that their wealth they earned. The same way an impoverished person comes to learn the world will fuck you over at every turn, so get yours when you can. The lessons we learn in life drive our behavior. The rich can't suddenly be expected to be more compassionate unless we are compassionate to the fact they are as lost as us, just richer.

A rich person learns they have agency and they are able to act on it. A poor person learns they are at the mercy of circumstance. So why should they not take any advantage they can, even if it means hurting others? After all, they get hurt by others all the time and no one cares.

Neither can magically change the behaviors that come from the lives they witnessed. Not without first noticing the only reason they do the behaviors is because of the lives they have led (I include the DNA that assembled them as part of that).",,,,surger1,,,1441231078,t5_2qhad,t3_3jdtsm,t1_cuohw0y,30,1444136326,0,0,cuomm5g,Seattle,30,,

"Tokyo of 15 years ago.

More on Tokyo of 15 years ago:

When the Suica card first came out in Tokyo in 2001, they couldn't be automatically recharged, but there are several places to recharge them in every train station. They have since added dual purpose credit/Suica cards that are auto-reloaded and billed with your credit card statement.

For me, the most frustrating thing about the Orca card is how slow it is to scan. With the Suica card, you could walk full clip past the reader, with the card in your wallet a few inches from the reader, and it would work flawlessly. With the Orca card, you just about have to be touching the machine and you have to pause for a second until you hear the right kind of beep. If you get the wrong kind of beep, about 3 of 5 times, you try again. Also, the positioning of the readers in the light rail stations, Westlake in particular, is very strange. Coming from the Nordstrom entrance for example, there's a reader by the lower traffic set of doors, but not by the other.

People have downvoted those suggesting we bus homeless to Utah but honestly wouldn't it be more economically sound to provide them with housing somewhere that is cheaper than Seattle?

"this is a pointless thread.  no one will understand/care about what it means to be a messenger.  i rode for buckys/dynimex and wa legal, then after the layoffs due to the electronic e filing for the courts i made my way to JJ's and ended up making way more money and being way happier.

as far as the riding goes, like i said, people who aren't messengers dont get it and thats alright.  people are calling you an asshole, and you are... so am i, everyone is.  but when talking about it to others that have no knowledge on how shit really runs i give them this scenario that is truly a daily occurrence for messengers:

I am called to law firm 'x' for a rush filing at the courthouse at 3:40.  Arrive at firm at 3:45, am told to wait as the file is not yet ready.  wait.  wait.  receive file at 3:52-55.  the courts filing room closes at 4:00 sharp and you have 5-15 blocks to ride.  now if you dont meet the deadline its not the end of the world. it will be taken back to base and filed first thing the next day, but if this becomes a pattern you will likely find yourself replaced by countless eager messenger wannabes who are desperate for a chance to ride.  now to make the deadline you have to do whatever it takes... red lights? fuckem.  one way? fuckit.  hole between a rock and a dead place? fucking hit it.  free lock your bike if you're brave and hit the stairs, sprint to the filing room and bam. job done, back to base and slam a beer.  ride home.

stories like that are dime a dozen in the messenger world. its whats expected of us.  we help cities run smoothly and  efficiently all while being absolutely hated for it.  i no longer ride for money, i miss it but i was hit by too many cars and have the scars and imbedded safety glass to prove it.  but god damn if i dont wax nostalgic when i think back to those days almost a decade ago.  messengers are true anti heros.  they dont give a fuck for you and know damn well you dont give a fuck for them.

"Negative feedback and shitty experiences. Being a woman in tech right now can be pretty miserable.  I only graduated a year ago, but I had some pretty horrible experiences with classmates and coworkers in college.  A couple of first-hand personal anecdotes...

-""You only got the job because you're a girl"" (frequently received, despite having a 3.95 GPA)

-""Women just don't make good programmers""

-""Girls just don't have mathematical minds""

-""You don't look like a programmer""

-Told that women get better grades in CS than they should because TAs want to sleep with us so they grade more easily

-Getting accused of being a ""booth babe"" while attending a technical conference as an engineer

-A CS classmate tried to blackmail me into dating him under the threat of accusing me of cheating.  School did nothing.  Expected to continue working with him, in school and in industry.

-A male coworker broke into the apartment building, and waited naked in the bed, refused to leave until the police came.  Fortunately he was fired.

-Crude, sexualized jokes, particularly ones that are directed at women, are frequent.  HR doesn't care.

-Being the only woman on a team of 80 guys who like to make ""get back to the kitchen and make me a sandwich"" jokes but you're a 19-year-old intern surrounded by men in their 30s-50s and its scary to stand up for yourself and risk no longer fitting in ""with the guys"" and ruin your chances of getting a positive reference

-CS classmate photoshopped pictures of me, put them on porn websites with my full name attached to them during the job hunt season.  It became the top search result for my name.  School did nothing.  Expected to continue working with him.  He became a coworker, and I left this company because I couldn't stomache the feeling of personal violation, and not knowing whether he was still secretly taking pictures of my feet for his fetish blog.

"&gt; So waste management is contracted by the city and that's a huge difference? Sounds like parsing to me, but if you could explain the difference, I'd appreciate it because I don't see it.

It is a difference because WM is trying to wring maximum profit out of the labor of its staff, so the staff (in my opinion) has the right to push back and get as much as they can from WM. In a school district, you're dealing with a management team that is trying to spend every penny they have, it's not like the administrators make more if the teachers make less, or the mayor gets more money. We may have to just agree to disagree on this point, but no, I'm not a fan of public employee unions. (Don't get me started on SPOG -- I think it's practically a criminal organization.)

&gt; And I'm not seeing why you're only mad at the teachers union here when it's the district that has refused to come to the table since the bargaining began and who waited until a few weeks ago to reject all of the unions proposals without any counter offer. In the months I've been watching this, I've seen one side put up every roadblock to negotiations that they could, and never work in good faith but you don't seem to hold them accountable at all.

Sorry, let me make my position on school administrations clear! If there is something worse than a teacher's union, it's the useless bureaucrats who run school districts, who always seem to find budget to add to their stupid bloated staffs and initiatives, but can't ever seem to get that money to the schools. I'm sure they're awful, but that doesn't mean that the money the S.E.A. wants actually exists.

&gt; Striking is something that no one wants, not even the teachers.

I wish the incredibly excited, can't-wait-to-strike, twitter account of the Seattle Teachers' Union felt the same way...

&gt; @SeattleEA: Seattle EA strike training underway -- we are prepared!

&gt; @SeattleEA: We're on Strike!

I totally believe the majority of *teachers* don't want to strike, but the union couldn't be more stoked. Because it really doesn't care about the teachers, or the kids, or the city. The union cares about the union and that's it.

But thank you very much for listening to me and having a conversation about it, even though we are probably never going to see eye to eye on this. I do respect teachers as individuals, I'm not anti teacher, but I don't think this strike helps anyone, and it grosses me out how excited the SEA is about it on Twitter.",,,,[deleted],,,1441781250,t5_2qhad,t3_3k67sx,t1_cuvcef8,-10,1444252517,0,0,cuvcz8f,Seattle,-10,,

"&gt; When people are offering $50k+ over asking and appraisal, waiving inspection, paying outrageous prices for tear downs in the CD and Rainier Valley we are in a bubble. [...] People are paying more than homes are worth right now in Seattle and elsewhere. 

&gt; When a 1200sq ft, 1960 rambler on a bad street in Des Moines sells in 2 days for $30k over asking with 9 offers things are out of whack. The buyers being more qualified today than ten years ago makes no difference. Overpaying is overpaying

By definition, someone is not overpaying if they are a willing buyer giving a willing seller a price that has been agreed upon by both parties.  Bubbles form when cheap money is chasing investment opportunities and pop when the cheap money runs out.  If people are buying houses to live in, versus pump and flip, that's not a bubble, that's a red hot real estate market.

Even at the flat bottom of the economic collapse, several housing areas did really well but the ""bubble"" markets--with liar loans and 120% LTV cash-outs and NINA qualifications--did not.  Look at Las Vegas metro.  There were whole tracts of subdivisions just outside the city limits that literally could not be given away (they held foreclosure auctions and no one came, including the bank holding the note).  Dallas/Fort Worth is another market; houses that used to go in the $100s are now at $160k and climbing.  Inside the city limits of both cities, but especially Dallas, prices are up 8% year-over-year while overall sales are flat or down because people are buying and holding and the available inventory is severely limited.

Seattle is seeing the same thing.  A massive influx of buyers--many flush with cash from high-paying jobs and signing bonuses--has arrived in the Puget Sound region.  That's why you have crappy ramblers on crappy streets in crappy suburbs going for more than you or your Realtor ""expect"" to pay; limited inventory plus high demand equals wow-appreciation.  Which, much to the chagrin of the anti-gentrification and anti-displacement crowd, is exactly how a free market economy works.  And is why we need to be able to build more housing units where people actually want to live, versus the far side of North Bend.

&gt; Based on what I've seen over the last 5 months of shopping, though, I would not even entertain the idea of buying within the Seattle city limits right now.

Based on what I've seen and the trends over the past decade, buying within the city limits (and *especially* on LR-or-higher-zoned land) is *exactly* where I would entertain buying.  More and more people are chasing fewer and fewer urban units.  Until places like Redmond, Kirkland, Lake Forest Park, Shoreline, and, yes, even Burien, get their thumbs out of their ears and allow building of actual density, the current market trend is for urban living, the kind of which can right now only be found in Seattle and (to some extent) Bellevue.",,,,somenewuser,Central Area,,1442288378,t5_2qhad,t3_3kytco,t1_cv1ytsv,11,1444369120,0,0,cv1z81a,Seattle,11,,flair

"As someone who has worked downtown for the last 8 years and has commuted from Everett to downtown for almost 3 of those years -- don't do it. Do whatever you can do avoid having to commute.

That's all it is from my house to work -- 24 miles, yet it takes upwards of an hour and a half at times. There's going to be times when you want to shoot yourself when something happens downtown (often) and all the buses are blocked and you're standing around for 45 minutes waiting on a bus. And times when you want to shoot yourself because at every slight change in weather or wind direction there's massive snarls in traffic. Yeah, there's the Sounder train but it's schedule is terrible (it has 4 options in the morning, and 4 in the evening, or youre out of luck. and the last early train is at 7:05am.. too early).

"&gt;3. SB: Is it ever smart to verbally confront a man who is groping you? (Like a woman recently did in the NY subway?) What do you say?

&gt;HK: Yes, if you feel safe, it can be very impactful to verbally confront a groper or any type of harasser. People grope and harass because they think they can get away with it and if you’re silent after being groped or harassed (which is sometimes necessary for safety reasons) that often lets them continue to get away with it. Calling them out lets them know you won’t stand by and let them abuse you and calling them out can inspire others around you to help stop the harasser or groper and to stand up to their own harassers or gropers.

&gt;If gropers/harassers can no longer grope and harass and then carry on their merry way because suddenly they are being confronted by their target, they will hopefully be less inclined to harass or grope again.

&gt;Additionally, as the former Executive Director of the Washington, D.C. Rape Crisis Center, Martha Langelan, teaches in her sexual harassment seminars, there are a few men out there who use street harassment, including groping, as a rape test. They may attempt rape depending on how a woman responds to street harassment. If she is assertive and forceful, they will leave her alone, but if she cowers, freezes, or humors them, they may escalate the harassment to rape.

"&gt; How many mistakes do you make in your job in a daily basis?

How many truck drivers have hit a pedestrian and been charged with vehicular manslaughter?  They didn't have to be acting in bad faith.  But they made a mistake on their job and they are charged accordingly.

&gt; When a police officer has to make a use of force decision it is far worse. 

Which is their job.  It is not a random event for which they are untrained and uncompensated.  And a lot of these incidents come because use of force should not have been necessary in the first place.  The John Williams shooting was a travesty because the officer believed him to be a threat and then got so close that he couldn't do anything but shoot if he didn't get immediate total compliance.  In the video, that officer was unholstering his gun before he even crossed out of camera range.  He confronted his victim without backup, without following his training, and simply couldn't be charged.  Specifically because of the law the Seattle Times is talking about. That's not justice. 

&gt; Do you think you could make perfect decisions under these conditions?

I don't expect perfect decisions.  I simply expect that mistakes which cause injury or death will have the same legal consequences for cops as they do for construction workers, truck drivers, sea captains, airline pilots, etc.  

I said I would like to see them *charged*.  That doesn't mean they'd all get convicted, or wouldn't plea to something lesser.

&gt; Bellevue isn't diverse!

&gt; Sure it is.  Check out the census

&gt; Oh I didn't mean diversity in the way that every single person has come to understand the term over the past decade!  Besides, those numbers are skewed by the Asians.

&gt; Asians don't count?

(Their next response is so racist I can't believe the supporters use it as a line of reasoning)

&gt; I mean, not really.  They're not underrepresented.

or

&gt; Well, you know what I mean.

She's been committed to a mental health facility after making suicidal comments. No idea what lead to this, but I hope she finds the hep and support she needs.

"It's got nothing to do with design or morals and everything to do with negligence.  Motorist failed to adequately pass the cyclist before turning, failed to signal, failed to so much as check the lane he was crossing when making a right turn into the drive way.  I mean, how much design do you think driveways need?  It's got a crap load of design.  It's got a bloody bike lane right there and WELL established rules of the road for passing, and for entering a driveway.  Driver drove up on the cyclist from behind, so he absolutely had opportunity to see the cyclist, and before the cyclist knows what's happening this guy is turning into him because he didn't bother to look, or because he didn't care.  Pick one.  It's a bright cloudless day without shadows, on dry pavement.  You literally can not ask for better driving conditions.  All the design in the world doesn't measure against negligence.  

I got hit by a school bus in this very manner - as it tried to go the wrong way up an off ramp onto I5 off Lakeview Blvd - turned right into me.  Nothing you can do, nowhere you can go.  Only thing you can do is try to get out from under it before the back wheels crush you.  Stop in time?  You have no idea.  Cars don't stop on a dime, and either do cyclists.  And it takes your brain a second to go from - I'm minding my business and obeying the rules of the road just like everyone else, I'm safe - to oh shit this person is about to fucking kill me in this completely unexpected way.

&gt; Do not park within 20 feet of the approach to marked or unmarked crosswalks.

Relevant code [RCW 46.61.570(b)(iii)](http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=46.61.570) - though this is for Washington, not Seattle specifically. But the same still applies.

There is also a law mentioned in that brochure about not parking [within 5 feet of streets/alleys/driveways](http://www.seattle.gov/transportation/parking/drivewaymarking.htm), which is another important thing to keep in mind - not only can it create some really unsafe conditions (especially when people do it in huge trucks or vans), but Seattle Parking Enforcement **loves** to ticket people for this.

Edit: Andor the 5-foot rule, be careful if you think you're just going to park illegally until morning, then move: I used to smoke outside every morning, and would regularly see Parking Enforcement doing rounds at the crack of dawn to catch people who thought that'd be a good idea!",,,,Polycystic,,,1441817400,t5_2qhad,t3_3k9bjb,t3_3k9bjb,23,1444259332,0,0,cuvr5sv,Seattle,23,,

The bridge will be closed the rest of the day.

Watching komo 4. A reporter interviewed a passenger. One of the buses got hit, a bus spun out of control, people getting thrown out the Ducks bus as it was spinning? The Seattle PD had to cut off the report and was pushing the camera away then it cut out. Kind of a gruesome looking scene. Another live feed from the bridge. A medical responder asking an officer to get the camera's out. People on stretchers being put into ambulances. 50 people being treated. Some very bad injuries here.
2 people have died says Komo 4. 
Edit - 4 vehicles involved total. A guy in a white truck witnessed the Duck bus swerve and thats what started it it sounds like. 

edit 2 - Apparently a witness was driving behind the Duck bus and said that the Duck bus did indeed initially hit a car, then after that hit the charter bus. Sounds like the two that died were from the charter bus. The most serious injuries were taken to Harborview. The lesser serious ones were taken via Metro bus to other nearby hospitals. They ran out of ambulances. Aurora/99 is going to be non accessible for atleast several hours. Traffic is a total mess right now. (im just relaying whats on king5/komo4). Duck bus swerved hard left onto the other vehicles. 90 firefighters were on scene. Traffic heavily congested S Lake Union. 

Front end of charter bus ""completely demolished"". Traffic on Aurora at a standstill. 

Students were on board. 

Witness: Jesse Christianson. Behind the duck bus. 150 yards approx. The duck boat was signaling to enter the left lane. As it turned to left lane it lurched suddenly. Front left wheel popped off, smoke. T boned charter bus. Charter bus was heading south. Duck boat heading north. Mechanical problem from duck boat. 

Ed Murray about to speak. 

12:48pm. Significant traffic delays today. Some roads closed throughout the day. Fremont/ballard bridge wont open for boats so there will be some capacity there. One of the buses had foreign students onboard. 
 4 deceased. 

It was a violent scene. People thrown off the buses while it was spinning. ",,,,lickdatshit,Bremerton,,1443120575,t5_2qhad,t3_3m8a3p,t3_3m8a3p,37,1444559397,0,0,cvcv3h2,Seattle,37,,flair

"As a teacher I get tired of this argument on any side of a labor dispute. Both a teachers union and a school board will use it at their convenience only. Just leave the emotional crap out of it and stick with the facts and be reasonable. Quit using kids as the political football. Because if you want to point a finger at people hurting kids, look at the state legislature, which has been held in contempt of court because they were found guilty of inadequately funding our schools for over 2 generations, and still have yet to offer a remedy.

For Seattle, they are absolutely entitled to walk out if their employer decides to lengthen the work day without a proper increase in compensation. Anybody in any job would want to take SOME kind of action against such a move. 180 school days at 30 more minutes a day turns out to be 90 hours for those not counting, in essence another 2.25 work weeks compared to a 40 hour work week. Again, leaving the children out of it, I can reasonably expect my pay to increase by precisely this rate (6.7% based on a 7.5 hour contacted work day) if this new expectation is passed. The school district proposed, what, 3.2%? To NOT walk out would implicitly show approval of such a dick move. 

But no, the ill-informed want to simplify this to a, ""do it for the kids"" plea. It works both ways, so in other words it doesn't work at all.

School district: ""If you cared about the kids, you'd do whatever it took to educate them.""

Teachers union: ""If you cared about the kids, you'd find a way to raise wages 6.7%, since that's the increased work load you're asking for. If you can't do this, then you shouldn't propose changes you can't afford.""

"Truly terrible weather (i.e. sustained heavy rain) isn't *too* common, but it does happen.  The prevailing weather is overcast with occasional showers, which can be mildly annoying but won't prevent you from walking around downtown.  Sunset is often quite pretty; there is often a break in the clouds over the sound that makes for some dramatic lighting in contrast with clouds over land.  Rainier likes to hide in the clouds for most of the wet season, although you could get lucky and hit a clear day.

So, you're not going to see the city at its best, but it's not totally pointless (which pretty much goes for the entire north-west).

I've spent a lot of time as a pedestrian, and the most important thing you can do is stay aware of your surroundings.  I see people walking down the street with their face down in a phone, the music coming out of their earbuds so loud that I can listen to their song from several feet away.  All it takes is one driver to be paying as little attention to cause an accident, and the pedestrian always loses no matter who is at fault.

To be clear, I've ridden with some pretty scary Metro drivers, and I fully support holding them accountable to high safety standards.  People also need to look out for themselves.

  Wed. Jun 11, 2014 4:07pm

Rolling through a stop sign while cycling on the Burke-Gilman Trail could cost you $87, the City of Kenmore warns.

In May, the city of Kenmore installed new stop signs at NE 175 Street and 61 Ave NE, making this intersection an “All Way Stop.” This  also includes the intersection of 61st Avene NE and the Burke Gilman Trail.

We received a notice from the city, warning cyclists that the Kenmore Police Department will start enforcing the stop signs at this intersection for all motorists and bicyclists.

According to King County Code 7.12.295, violating the established trail use regulations -- e.g. obeying all signs, speed limits, etc. -- will result in $87 penalty.",,,,ChefJoe98136,West Seattle,,1441831859,t5_2qhad,t3_3ka6il,t1_cuw00kb,13,1444263889,0,0,cuw0oys,Seattle,13,,flair

You can sell cards through our online buy list, then either drop off the cards in store if you're local, or mail them in. Once your cards are graded and the order finalized, you'll receive a detailed invoice with the grade and price of each card. If you want a chance to review the grading before selling, just leave a note on the order (available in the step just before submitting the invoice) requesting to verify the grading. We'll return any cards free of charge or shipping costs if you are not happy with the grade. 

We do have a specialty buyer for those that would rather sell their cards as a collection, or are not comfortable using the buy list to sell high value cards. PM me or contact Card Kingdom's customer support if this is of interest.

"The ducks have cv joints that can come apart rather suddenly and cause wheel lock up. There are pictures of the wheel where the spindle/knuckle assembly can be seen connected to the tire. The assembly pivots on two kingpins (stub shafts) that are integral to the axle housing. Somehow the spindle/steering knuckle separated from these kingpins or the pins themselves separated from the axle. 

I suspect that wheel lockup due to cv joint failure could have applied enough torque to the kingpins to cause such a failure.

"I know shit all about Seattle frankly. I stumbled in from /r/all, So this is certainly a more western approach to the problem than Seattle specific. But this really isn't a Seattle specific issue

You are correct that offering free things in one area while the problem  remains active at large is an issue.

There are seriously endless problems that can be solved with basic income. It's essentially all of us agreeing to say that in this age of massive massive abundance. Where technology and past human accomplishment so clearly are responsible for the modern way of being. All descendants deserve part of what our collective ancestors put together. Whatever we do beyond a basic income is up for debate but we need to agree that everyone deserves something for nothing. By being born in this time you live at the pinnacle of technology, to an order of magnitude that is hard to comprehend. We can't begrudge people the most basic needs.

It's not that we don't have enough, it's that it's distributed poorly and begrudgingly. If you are at a dinner party and one guest is eating 90% of the food... do you tell the other guests they should have gone to the store and brought more? Well the greedy guest just gobbles that up to. There isn't a number big enough to solve the problem. All the other guests are not only hungry they are disenfranchised.

Poverty is exactly that situation. You can't solve it by giving them things. It's not a resource issue. It's that they aren't treated like people. It's how you live when you grew up with next to nothing in a society of abundance who begrudges you for wanting anything else.

As a kid I was given pig feed. My family was so poor I only had a woodstove to heat the place. Water in my bedroom would freeze in the winter. My grandparents were millionaires, many of my aunts and uncles are now as well. I went to school with some very wealthy people. And I was mocked endlessly for my clothes and the smell of smoke in them. I did poorly socially because of this and the early social problems compounded. At 11 I was so tortured by my life I even tried and failed at suicide. It was minor and rarely that any of them did anything to step in. They mostly felt my parents brought it on themselves.

I did buy heavily into the narrative about bootstraps and stuff though. It's why I hold the position I do today. I went to college and got a very useful Diploma. I worked for my government with Secret security clearance. I cannot explain how much extra shit I got while there, wine tastings, curling, lunches after lunches. Showered with perks. And I always reflected on how mad everyone got at my family for being poor. For having so little we needed welfare and still had to eat pig feed. But hey, now that I was on the ins with another class it's fine to spend the equivalent of my families welfare for several years on a trip to a sugar bush. It's a terrible waste of money to spend it on a family but boy howdy did we need that feather in our cap to be a stronger team at work. I was making something so people from the office could upload their baby pictures!

I've built medical research robots and worked billion dollar debt systems. The modern age in many ways is absurdly kind to the impoverished. And yet currently I am crippled. 2 years ago I had a mental breakdown while handling a ambulance dispatch project. I tried to kill myself again, and I've been in a bit of mental health decline since. I'm not overly stable and have even taken to self harm. Substance abuse is also an issue because I simply have issues coping with the suicidal extreme self hatred.

I've been in therapy and here's the biggest kicker for all of this shit. Poverty is traumatizing. Being in a state where you don't know if you can afford to live or not does things to you. 2 years ago I tried to fall back on my employment insurance and it was revoked because my case was medical. I was without assistance for periods of time because due to bureaucratic nightmares I didn't qualify .ex wife had our condo and so I couldn't get assistance or afford a different place to live, it was my quasi homeless stage. (Only one rough sleep)

So I was born into a situation that gave me a crippling mental illness. Despite doing everything I was told to help myself escape my situation and the intricacies of the issues still keep me back. I'm forced into a situation where I am not exactly stable but expected to act rational and work my way through of my own accord. I finally finally found therapy that I can afford and I'm paying for it out of pocket. I'm forgoing food a bit for it too thanks very much, I'm down about 20lbs since I started. I'm lucky that I have some pudge and I'm actually hoping that I get more money before my fat runs out. I'm legit using it as a calorie store right now. It's weird. Trying to just eat veggies and fruits with some meat to keep the nutrients up.

That's why I believe basic income is the perfect solution. Just give every fucking person access to the basics. It's not for the food, or the shelter. It's that by doing so they might feel like a fucking person again. I can't tell you if there is anything I could possibly live for that would make my life worth what it's been. I can't seem to kill myself so I do my best to work towards a future that might be. I'm very suicidal and depressed but as you and many others make very clear. If I don't help myself then no one will.

My honest to goodness hope is that if I can survive and get myself understood that I might end this insanity for others. I want to die so fucking bad every day. All the time. It's frankly half maddening. And if I can't kill myself then I will devote my time to trying to find a way to end this for others. To try and get people to see why their attitudes about the impoverished are not just bad, but the very source of the issue. It's not that the poor don't have resources. It's that people don't treat them like people.

&gt;The more we tolerate the problem, the more we attract those that have it, and the more militant that those that have the problem get.

This right here. It dehumanizes them. Drug problems come from social ostracization. Contrary to what you think if you just give them money and stop fucking judging them for what they do with it. They will stop of their own accord. Give them a god damn chance and they will do it. Of course not all of them, but that's not chaos theory. The more opportunity you provide the better. And it's seriously not there despite how much people think it is.

Look how much we hate each other. Endlessly misunderstanding each other and trying to find which group is the problem. The hate is the issue, everyone is a person and is deserving of some respect for that alone. Those that demand respect is earned don't understand by doing so they are agreeing that respect isn't a concept. It can only be given.

If you give the impoverished respect, even when you don't see how they deserve it. Then that's the only way they can rise to it. Stop begrudging people things you only think you earned yourself. By being born not in poverty you have been given something that I could never ever ever buy. Even if I get better, it's not worth it.",,,,surger1,,,1441236456,t5_2qhad,t3_3jdtsm,t1_cuonmvw,16,1444137727,0,0,cuopl4i,Seattle,16,,

"As an incoming freshman there's not a lot the UW offers that you cannot find at a community college for less than half the price. True, you won't be living in the dorms or a Greek house, but if you can forego that temptation to conform you can escape your first two years with a LOT less debt. That translates to paying back a lot less debt when you graduate. 

My first class at the UW was held in a lecture hall with 500 other students. Nobody cared if I lived or died. It was impossible to connect with anyone. When I was at community college, certain classes wouldn't even *start* until we ascertained where everyone was and if they were expected to be there or not. I connected on a personal level with my profs in several classes. I got recommendations and won scholarships. 

Think about it. If you get a good job paying, say, 50K/yr your first year after you graduate that'll be about $2900/mo take home pay. Subtract $1400 rent (standard for 1br), $250 car payment, $75 car insurance, $150 phone/internet/cable/netflix, what do you have left? You have $1025 that you'll need for your student loans and groceries and savings and clothes and entertainment and anything you want to purchase. Now, the difference between owing $50K in student loans and owing $20K in student loans is the difference between a payment of $560/mo and $220/mo. 

Subtract $220/mo student loan from $1025 and that leaves you with about $800/mo for all of the above. Still do-able.

Subtract $560/mo student loan from $1025 and you get $465/mo. Which is really tight.

When most major dignitaries come to any city, it is going to disrupt the normal routine in some way. Just look at all the foreign conferences: APEC, ASEAN, G8, G20, etc...

&gt; When can these be scheduled for completion?  Since I have made these requests multiple times and do not feel I am receiving proper service, I want to discuss this with you.  If you believe they have been done correctly or do not need to be done, why is that?

"It sucks, but I'm not really sure what you expected. We had a major storm with massive parts of the city and suburbs without power and many areas without cell service.

Sounds like you did what you should and got photos of his ID and the van. Send it to your insurance company and let them figure it out - it's what they do. Plus it's not like having a police report would have you driving in your vehicle any sooner. Maybe give the local police station a call and see if you can still file a report? Not sure if that would help.

Do you have reason to believe he was drunk? I saw plenty of people run straight through intersections that had no power. People were just oblivious to what was going on around them. It was the second or third one of those I witnessed that I realized *I* shouldn't be on the roads.

Based on how you described it, you should still be able to argue the other driver was at fault simply because intersections without power are four way stops. Hard to get to the speeds you're talking about without running straight through them and the damage should show that this wasn't a slow speed fender bender.

What this comes down to is who will pay your deductible. If he has insurance, your insurance company should fight for you and get his insurance to pay up.

"This probably has been the best well-written article I've read in a while. 

It definitely made what we're doing here in Seattle look like shit compared to an actual solid structure in Utah. Tent cities, that sounds lovely....

Also surprising was the process used in Utah, provide housing and people will pick themselves up sooner rather than later. That's easy enough and ends up costing less and ACTUALLY solves the problem. Seattleites, at least here in this subreddit, have such a shit attitude against the homeless. Some of it rightfully so, no one should put up with people shitting in apartment building doorsteps, but that shows we don't have any type of real safety net in place. 

Instead of bussing all of our homeless to Utah, maybe get all of our collective heads out of our asses and ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING about it.

"I can relate, though...the same thing happened to me when I was about twenty, also on a bus.  It was crowded, but not so crowded that the guy HAD to stand so close behind me...and then I realized that his bumping me repeatedly wasn't just from the rocking of the bus.

But I also just froze.  We're so programmed to be ""nice girls,"" don't cause a fuss, don't make a scene, don't upset anyone.  I wondered, what if I'm mistaken, and I accuse him of something when he wasn't really doing that at all?  Of course, looking back, it was perfectly clear that he was deliberately rubbing off on me, but at the time, I just didn't have the confidence to trust my own perceptions.  The imperative to stay a ""nice girl"" runs so deep for a lot of us that our first instinct is to keep on being one, even when the person we're dealing with has broken every rule of ""nice,"" civilized behavior and deserves nothing of the kind in return.  And yeah, there are plenty of creeps who count on that.

I would also like to think, all these years later, that I would be willing to make that scene now, and stand up for myself, and call the creep out.  I'm a lot more willing than I used to be to drop the ""niceness"" when that's what's called for.  But would I have, if I'd been this woman, in this situation?  I honestly can't say for sure I would.

It's depressing to see the posts here that appear to be from men who just don't get that--who have no idea how differently and powerfully women are socialized, and who aren't listening when we try to tell them.

"If you work in Seattle I'm skeptical that you'll save very much. When you are doing your calculation, make sure you are accounting for vehicle milage correctly.

In lieu of doing your own calculations its fair to just assume $0.45 per mile. 30 mile trip both ways 5 days a week is $540 per month. 

It's up to you if you want to consider the value of your own time. If you have the option of working paid overtime, it certainly makes sense to live close and work rather than spend time in a car.

"Important information about our outdated and unsafe local infrastructure:

&gt; The bridge, built in 1931, is classified as functionally obsolete and its six lanes are notoriously narrow.
&gt;  City information about the width of the lanes, current as of 2012, reveals the outside lanes are the widest, at 10 feet. The middle lanes going each way are the narrowest at 9 feet, and the two inside lanes are 9.5 feet wide.

Additional relevant article: [""Span’s narrow lanes a longtime safety concern""](http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/transportation/spans-narrow-lanes-a-longtime-safety-concern/)
&gt;  [T]he Washington State Transportation Department considered building barriers on the Aurora Bridge in 2003.

&gt; The study noted that the bridge’s narrow lanes posed risks and that the lack of a center barrier to separate cars often traveling faster than the speed limit, “increases the risk for crossover/head on traffic accidents.”

&gt; Engineers found the bridge “will not allow any additional weight loading,” which ruled out widening the whole deck. Instead, they recommended building new sidewalks below the road deck, to allow wider car lanes and a 2-foot-wide barrier above, at a cost of $29 million.

&gt; That recommendation was never pursued.

*Why was this safety recommendation never pursued?*

&gt; “That is definitely something we’re going to be taking a good hard look at in the coming days and weeks,” Kubly said.

&gt; The 9½-foot-wide lanes on the bridge are barely enough to contain some vehicles.

"&gt; How is this going to make traffic better?

The key is the definition of ""better"".  WA DOT needs to maintain a 45mph average in the HOV lanes in order to keep getting federal funding for highways. This effort is aimed at meeting that goal. The point is not to move more people per unit-of-time on the highway.  It's to get the HOV lane in particular moving at a particular speed. It doesn't matter _how many people_ go that speed, as long as the lane averages that speed.   It doesn't matter if a larger share of people spend more time commuting, as long as the HOV lane is flowing. One way to increase the speed is to decrease the density - make it so that the HOV lanes carry fewer vehicles. This change will do that. 

I guess the hoped-for secondary effect is that more people will take public transit, will carpool, or will live closer to work.

"Section 166 (HOV/HOT Lanes)

Section 166(c) of Title 23 provides authority for public agencies to allow toll-paying vehicles that do not meet the minimum occupancy standards to use high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes. Such lanes are commonly referred to as high occupancy toll (HOT) lanes. This tolling authority is available for facilities both on and off the Interstate System.


Value Pricing Pilot Program (VPPP)

The VPPP is an experimental program that is designed to assess the potential of different value pricing approaches for reducing congestion. Under this program, tolls may be imposed on existing toll-free highways, bridges, and tunnels, so long as variable pricing is used to manage demand. Congress has authorized slots for up to 15 value pricing programs, which are allocated to state or local agencies. Seven of these slots have been permanently allocated to States that have executed agreements for tolling projects under the program. The remaining eight slots have been temporarily reserved for State agencies that are pursuing other eligible activities under the program, including value pricing studies and non-toll value pricing projects; these slots may become available in the future as those activities are completed. Once an agency holds a slot, there is no limit on the number of value pricing projects that can be implemented under that slot.",,,,ChefJoe98136,West Seattle,,1443641304,t5_2qhad,t3_3mzwq9,t1_cvjmioq,16,1444676229,0,0,cvjn3hp,Seattle,16,,flair

"I don't get how/why people will complain about paying $.75 or even $2.50 to dramatically cut their commute time and gas consumption (and emissions, BTW) when they'll pony up $3.50 for a fancy coffee once or twice a day. What is a half hour of your life worth to you? $.25? $.10? Or is it just a matter of principle?

You should consider how much your free time, such as extra sleep, extra time with the kids / dog / SO, is worth to you on both ends of your commute. Put an actual dollar value on it, much like your employer puts a dollar value on your work time. Then see how much time you're literally spending during your commute time, or waiting in silly lines to save a buck-fifty on a fill-up @ Costco, or the drive-thru at S'bucks.

Let's say the average toll is $5 per day (round-trip), and it saves you an hour each day. Assuming about 20 commuting days a month, that's about $100/month for 20 hours of your life back, so you're putting a value of $5/hr on your free time/life, and that's before calculating in the gas savings. So you'd be paying yourself less than the minimum wage for your free time. My free time is worth far more to me than that, but that's simply my opinion.

I think it's a good investment to hop in those toll lanes for less stress and more free time.",,,,AliveAndThenSome,Kirkland,,1443653024,t5_2qhad,t3_3mzwq9,t1_cvjlhgc,36,1444679992,0,0,cvjuy1f,Seattle,36,,flair

"Victim blaming seems pretty par-for-the-course whenever someone gets killed by a negligent motorist.  Could this have been avoided by the victim?  Yes.  This was still 100% the motorist's fault.

While we're talking about self-preservation, how about we look out for pedestrians when driving in dense urban areas.  I mean, if you hit and kill someone on a crosswalk, they die, but their family is going to sue to you into bankruptcy, on top of any criminal charges you might be handed.  The driver doesn't just go on without consequences, you know.  They have to go to traffic court, criminal court, and civil court and are often punished in some way for what they did.

"Live and die by the ferry.  Once you're used to it, it's not so bad. Always carry a book, and keep a blanket, some granola bars, and maybe a bottle of screw top Emergency Ferry Wine (if that's your thing) in your trunk. Beats sitting in traffic. 

Walk on if at all possible, especially during the summer. 
Do not drive on the ferry during the summer. 
Do not drive on the ferry during holidays or holiday weekends.
Do not even look at the ferry during summer weekends and holidays.
Do not drive onto the island between 6AM and 9AM
Do not drive off the island between 4PM and 7PM, unless you can time it for the 5 minute window between when the traffic from the last ferry clears and the traffic from the next ferry begins. 
Always take the back roads, regardless.

The island's small but if you like reasonably easy access to the city when you want it, but small town 'hey how's it going?' knowing everyone in the grocery store the rest of the time, there you go. After years in a Big City it's nice to know your friends and neighbors. 

And there's other perks. Like today I went ""Labor. Day. Fuck. It."", peace-d out, and spent the rest of the afternoon fishing.  If you like outdoor things there's, you know, water all around, plus lots of parks and trails, and easy access to the Olympics and Kitsap peninsula.  

Nightlife is what you make of it. Belltown it is NOT. Hanging with friends, grab a drink, occasional parties at someone's farm or something which are a blast. There's a couple good bars, theaters, lots of active groups and organizations. If you need constant reassurance from an endless parade of people your own age...yeah no. If you're in your 20s to mid-30s, and especially single, you are a demographic minority for sure. Nobody that age can afford to live here without say, The Room Above Their Parent's Garage, so few do.

Downsides: 
The ferry will screw you. One day. Somehow. Royally. Make peace with that. It will break down on the morning of your Wedding Day that also happens to be your parent's funeral while you or your fiance is about to give birth.  There is some kind of natural law at play in this.

Your old friends will not come visit. For some reason people will sit an hour in traffic to get from Ballard to Cap Hill but 'hey, walk on the ferry and I'll pick you up' is like 'so just take the ring to Mount Doom...' And you'll find yourself doing it too.  ""Aww man, all the way out *there*..."" Eventually you'll find yourself one grey morning by shore, scowling across the mist at the dim shapes in the distance, muttering ""*Mainlanders...*""

The reputation as wealthy hippies isn't too far off, but most people on the rock are reasonably ok, normal people. Used to be that people went out of the way to not look like they had a lot of money.  Waterfront house, drives old Volvo kinda stuff. Maybe a bit less so in the last couple years. The island is VERY educated and VERY lefty democratic, in the ""we'd like to do something about that problem, so long as it stays waaay over there, and only if it just involves writing checks and/or petitions."" There's a lot of NIMBYism, and self-appointed guardians of All That Is Good And Bainbridge, squabbling about things that don't matter... Normal small town stuff that people get up to when they're bored and people are too polite to tell them where to stick it.

Housing. There is nowhere to rent unless you know someone. A lot of rental property never hits the open market. There is hardly anywhere to buy either. And it's all vastly overpriced. So this whole thing was kinda moot I guess...sorry.

"here's why they couldn't:
the district says that they have been negotiating since may, however the district was literally a no-show at many negotiating meetings.
the union made multiple proposals on a lot of different issues which were sitting in the districts hands for months and were all summarily rejected just a couple of weeks ago.
there is no way for teachers to strike in the summer because the work they're doing doesn't involve teaching (it's planning and training) and also, the union and the district were supposed to be negotiating a new contract.  the old contract expired this week or last week, so there was hope that the union and the district would come together on a contract.

If you want to blame somebody, try the district who has refused to move on anything for the past few months while denying teachers cost of living increases for the past 6 years.  And now they're offering an 8% pay increase over three years while asking teachers to start working 7% more (an extra 30 min/day) starting next year.  Would YOU work longer hours in the hopes that in three years you'd be back to the same wages you started with?

"Currently the feds are pretty restrictive about tolling interstates and how/where toll revenue is used.  One exception you'll see is when a toll road was later upgraded into an interstate.

https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/ipd/fact_sheets/tolling_programs.aspx
QUICK FACTS

Any toll facility using Federal funds must qualify for toll authority under one of four toll programs.

Toll pilot programs have limited participation and require toll agreements prior to the implementation of tolling. Mainstream toll programs do not require tolling agreements and have unlimited participation.

The use of toll revenue is restricted under all of the Federal programs, and is generally limited to the repayment of financing for the project and for operations and maintenance. Revenues may also be used for other eligible purposes in some circumstances.",,,,ChefJoe98136,West Seattle,,1443640330,t5_2qhad,t3_3mzwq9,t1_cvjlvdi,12,1444675894,0,0,cvjmdxq,Seattle,12,,flair

"The Office of the Mayor of Seattle has [issued this info](http://murray.seattle.gov/seattle-plans-for-traffic-during-visit-of-chinese-delegation/#sthash.uaL2BRR1.LmK97GN6.dpbs).

Copy of info from website:
---
The City of Seattle is working with local and federal agencies to manage traffic on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday of next week during the visit of a large Chinese delegation. Seattle officials are working to support U.S. Secret Service efforts to provide security.

“Seattle is honored to host President Xi and his delegation during his visit to the United States,” said Mayor Ed Murray. “With an international visit of this stature and the accompanying federal security requirements, we want all travelers to be advised of the impacts to business as usual. Everyone needs to be patient, reevaluate their commute plans, add in extra travel time, and monitor traffic alerts for the latest information.”

Intermittent closures of freeways, regional arterials and downtown streets are expected. The flow of buses and cars in downtown Seattle and around the region will be disrupted.

Travelers in Seattle are advised to plan ahead and expect traffic delays on all three days. Those who can postpone trips downtown or work from home are encouraged to do so.

Drivers should consult local media and follow reports on Facebook and Twitter to learn the latest developments; consult the City of Seattle’s website, SDOT’s [Traveler’s Information](http://web6.seattle.gov/travelers/) page and WSDOT’s website for current traffic conditions; sign up to receive [emergency alerts](http://alert.seattle.gov/) from the City of Seattle. (See additional information sources below.)

Vehicle access to the area bounded by Olive St., 7th Ave, Lenora St and 4th Ave. may be limited all three days. Drivers should expect street closures and restricted access. Commuters are encouraged to use transit or park outside the area and walk in. People entering the area should expect delays and additional security screening.

Buses on surface streets in the north part of downtown will be rerouted; check with [King County Metro Alert](http://metro.kingcounty.gov/alerts/) for routes impacted. The South Lake Union Streetcar will continue to operate, but the stop at the Westlake Hub at McGraw Square will remain closed. The downtown transit tunnel is expected to remain open and operating.

Parking on downtown streets will be restricted as needed.

Fans attending the [Seattle Sounders](http://www.soundersfc.com/matchday/transportation/guide) game at 7 p.m. on Wednesday at Century Link Field should expect significant traffic delays and allow more travel time than usual.

SDOT engineers will adjust traffic signal timing within the city based on expected closures and re-routing. The SDOT Transportation Operations Center will monitor traffic and provide ongoing advisories to the public on Twitter. SDOT will post messages on dynamic message signs as needed.

"&gt;wide perfectly acceptable sidewalk

Are you a cyclist?  I am honestly not sure because you did not note it in your post.  You may be, you may not.  In any case, it's really not a good idea to ride on that 'perfectly acceptable sidewalk' for a number of reasons, which all boil down to it being more dangerous for the cyclist and for pedestrians.  

It also is not negligent, and not rude to ride in the road.  The paved lanes are not solely for cars, they are for all many modes of transport, from buses to cars to even bicycles.  That's State law.  

Me, I ride downtown occasionally and will take the lane when it's appropriate, or I'll filter between cars when there's space (usually also when the cars are stopped at a traffic light) and I'll ride in the bike lane where one is provided.  

Please also note that there are things called 'sharrows' painted in travel lanes around the city- these indicate *for cyclists* what the desired lane position is, and these also indicate *for drivers* that there can be cyclists sharing the lane.

&gt; Mike Glave, 55, said the fire started in his unit.

&gt; He said he was awakened by a loud pop about 3:30 p.m., but didn’t see anything and went to the store about 4:30. At 5:30 p.m., he said he came home, and from the hallway, heard his smoke alarm. He opened the door to a cloud of black smoke. Glave said he pulled a fire alarm and began banging on doors to alert residents.

"[18 USC 1752](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1752) doesn't actually mention searches... it just allows declaring restricted grounds which seems fairly uncontroversial to me. There is a [good discussion of it's constitutionality from the DoJ](http://www.justice.gov/usam/criminal-resource-manual-1547-constitutionality-18-usc-1752).

I don't know how that statute gives the power to search, but I imagine the legal argument goes something like this ""That ground is restricted, there is no right to be there. The gov't says 'you can go there, if we can search you', ie you are only authorized to be there if you consent. There is no fourth amendment violation because you are secure in property against searches unless you opt in to the terms of going into that restricted grounds.""

In those terms I don't think it is so unreasonable, so long as they aren't swooping up large swathes of land under s1752.

"More than 90% of all economists agree that rent control has negative effects, and a thorough survey of the available literature identifies countless problems it introduces (Jenkins, 2009:  http://econjwatch.org/file_download/238/2009-01-jenkins-reach_concl.pdf )

Rent controls actually introduce many negative effects in areas progressives care about, like quality of housing and the tendency for rent controls to actually increase income disparity (as wealthier individuals win competitions for rare units, except at lower prices).

In the words of one economist (Hazlett, 1982):  ""Economists have been notoriously thorough in convincing themselves of the destructive effects of rent control and notoriously inept at convincing anyone else.""  If you find yourself supporting rent control, please take a minute to read some of the available research and reconsider your conclusions.

"Want a Mercer Island story? Read this bill sitting in the House right now...

http://app.leg.wa.gov/billinfo/summary.aspx?year=2015&amp;bill=1498#documents

This bill would mandate that ALL emergency responders in the state would have to pay for, equip, be trained on, and learn to administer corticosteroids for pediatric adrenal insufficiency syndrome. This would amount to at least a couple million dollars statewide that local governmental EMS agencies would have to pay out of their budgets to enact and maintain for a situation that almost all EMTs and Paramedics will never see or even be able to clinically recognize when it happens (because it is so rare).

Where do you think this got feet? Where? When presented on the floor of the house, a couple crying mothers from the island with their doctor got up and told a great sob story that unfortunately pulled at the heart strings of those in attendance. It's still up for a vote, but the clinicians in charge of EMS in the state feel it might be an uphill battle to reverse the emotional release that was allowed to sell this in the House.

In a state with such a high mortality rate due to heroin, we still can't train our EMT basics on intranasal narcan use, but this is what's most important.

"The truth is that society and culture shape the political landscape much more than vice versa. Things are the way things are not just because there are bad people, there are always bad people, but because we don't care enough to do much about it. We foster and support a news media system that is shallow, compassionless, and anti-intellectual with a short attention span. This has particularly drastic results when it comes to elections. The information that tends to come across from the media about candidates is often limited to scandals, the ""horse race"" / fame / contest aspect, and very little about policies, history, accountability, etc. The result is a toxic environment that sane people tend to avoid and that only the corrupt or the vain tend to be drawn to. Scandals eliminate some folks from candidacy, but the remaining folks are nearly just as bad so it doesn't exactly make a huge difference. A good chunk of this comes because our media gets paid based on the number of eyeballs watching, and that sort of accounting will always cause the content that is made with the least effort that brings in the most views to rise to the top, while anything that takes more work to produce or is more difficult to consume and spread in popularity (regardless of its quality) will be at a disadvantage in terms of revenue and financial sustainability.

"For /u/EnergyCoast and others, my rebuttal:

- I don't want a levy that votes in a hard, unchangeable list of projects.  Over the years of a levy, things change and I don't want to wind up with an outdated list of things that must be built.  Having a list of priorities and ""this is what is deemed necessary, now"" is good as a baseline; I don't object to a future Council changing the list with a good reason since that's their job.

- To wit: ""Voters should remember that Bridging the Gap promised a Lander Street overpass in Sodo for freight mobility, but that money was diverted to rebuild Mercer Street.""  Which is exactly what I would expect to happen.  Mercer St was deemed a higher priority due to the changing circumstances, so it got done first.

- For the LWV's complaint about using levies to fund maintenance, I'm ideologically in agreement but telling pavement ""we shouldn't fix you like this"" doesn't fix the pavement or the bridges or the other things that need doing.  When confronted with levy vs. not at all, I'm taking the levy.

- ""It also does not help fix the Aurora Bridge's lack of a protective center barrier, which was spotlighted in Thursday’s deadly accident.""  As soon as Washington State turns that bridge over to the City of Seattle, we can talk about who pays for what.  Until then, the state should be maintaining safe state roads.

- ""A promised streetcar line from Pioneer Square to Broadway — itself a questionable use of scarce city dollars...""  The FHSC is spending money from the Sound Transit tax base--north King subarea only--and the federal government.  Yes, it is a travesty and yes, we should have had a First Hill subway stop, but it didn't get paid for out of a local (say, Bridging the Gap) levy.

- Finally: ""Nor does Move Seattle promise much innovation to ease the city's intractable gridlock. Although 81 percent of trips in the region are taken by car, Move Seattle proposes a paltry $13 million investment in traffic-light signalization.""  Nothing is going to fix ""intractable gridlock"" in this city as long as ""traffic"" is defined as primarily based around one or two people per car and lots of cars in a small space.  If you assume, as I do, that the public right of way is for the efficient movement of *people*, not just vehicles, then spending transportation money to improve how people move is justified.  Make the bus and cycle infrastructure stable, efficient, and inviting and then more people will be more likely to use it.  Besides, where do we put all of these new roads that some would have us build?",,,,somenewuser,Central Area,,1443461591,t5_2qhad,t3_3mpwfi,t3_3mpwfi,12,1444632136,0,0,cvh32e3,Seattle,12,,flair

"&gt;Further, your actions towards the individual violated Department Manual Section 5.140(2), which states that
""Employees shall not make decisions or take actions that are influenced by bias, prejudice or discriminatory
intent."" Your actions in this case were far from trained expectations and policies. Notably, the day before your
confrontation with the individual, you received training on'Biased Free Policing and Voluntary Contacts and
Teruy Stops, yet apparently did not utilize that contemporaneous training or what your years of experience
should have taught you about acceptable behavior. Considerable circumstantial evidence indicates that these
deviations and your approach to the civilian were motivated by bias. During your interviews with OPA, you
indicated that your perception of the race, sex, and age of others influenced how you interacted with and reacted
to events regarding this individual and, more generally, events in the worþlace. You discussed your view that
the individual's age and sex contributed to his reaction towards you as a female officer, and stated that you
would not be investigated were you not white. V/ithout prompting, you described how you viewed the
resolution of his charges as an example of racial bias because ""guess who"" - a black judge and black chief were
not, in your view, supporting white officers. Even during your Loudermill hearing, you continued to blame
minorities for your perceived mistreatment on account of your race (white). Your perceptions of race and other
protected categories appear to be so deeply seated that they likely impacted the authoritarian manner in which
you treated this man and your refusal to deviate from that approach towards an individual whose actions did not
warrant such treatment.

I agree with this action in general and am glad the officer was fired, but this paragraph is completely stupid.  They seem to be concluding that someone who accuses others of treating them unfairly because of their race must, themselves, be racist.

The Aurora bridge is stick-straight and has a clear view line. There are no pedestrians or buildings or intersections in sight. These are basically the perfect conditions for encouraging excessively fast travel.

It's designed like a highway, and it has a highway-quality speed limit (40 mph). And everyone speeds anyway, because apparently traffic laws are for losers.

Highways have dividers for a reason.

You can certainly design a corridor where people don't try to drive at 45 mph.

The persons owning or operating any such bridge shall maintain, at their own expense, such lights and other signals thereon as the Commandant of the Coast Guard shall prescribe. If the bridge shall be constructed with a draw, then the draw shall be opened promptly by the persons owning or operating such bridge upon reasonable signal for the passage of boats and other water craft.""

"First - Congrats on getting the EnChroma glasses! I got my pair in July but my wife ordered them for me in May. Took such a long time to get them. 

Pike Place is a good idea but my experience is that blues, greens and reds have the biggest difference (I'm also red-green). Plus, you need to be in bright, natural light. Pike Place is indoor/outdoor so you won't get as crazy of an experience.

I'd say somewhere like the Arboretum near Lake Washington would be good.  Lots of blues, greens and the fall colors will be changing. Oranges and reds will be cool. 

When you get the glasses, you have to put them on and leave them on for 15-20 minutes to give your brain a chance to adjust to new inputs (you can't do that ""on,off"" thing you naturally want to do to see the difference in colors). EnChroma recommends you wear the new glasses for like 10 hours in the first two weeks on and off for maximum impact. It was pretty easy to do during July but may be harder with the two upcoming weeks of grey weather predicted for Seattle (just keep that in mind because that instruction surprised me when I opened them).

"&gt; The amphibious Duck vehicles also fall under the Coast Guard’s authority. That agency annually inspects the 20 Ducks in operation in Seattle to assess their safety in the water, a Coast Guard spokesman said Thursday. **Duck No. 6 was last inspected by the Coast Guard and approved for operations in March.**

Duck 6 was actually inspected as recently as March 2015.

&gt; After the accident, the UTC released its most recent inspection report of Ride the Ducks from December 2012, **in which an inspector described the firm as “safety-oriented.”**

The UTC released this after the crash, they seem to still believe in their assessment.

&gt; Aside from state reviews, charter-bus companies such as Ride the Ducks are “required to perform Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance (CVSA) inspections on every vehicle, once a year,” Maxwell said. “They are required to maintain that documentation in their files, which the UTC will look for in our compliance review.”

Duck 6 would have received an internal yearly inspection at minimum.  There's no way a company that the UTC calls ""safety-oriented"" is skipping on inspections.

I take it you're not from the area. 47th to 50th street on the ave is a very well known open air drug market that the police only has periodic and tenuous control over. 

If they're not going to deal with that I doubt they're going to chase off some homeless folks. Especially considering the long and storied history ave rats have in the district. I made this post because it seems like there are more of them than usual but they've had a presence here for decades in some form or another. The police aren't responding to actual property crimes- enforcing low level shit like this just isn't going to happen; at least not in a sustained and permanent manner.

Hell, last year there was a mini tent city on 43rd/the ave by the post office that was up for several weeks because the Seattle PD claimed it was the post office's deal and the post office vice versa claimed it was Seattle PD's jurisdiction.

"When I read opinion pieces or comments on news stories about cycling, the most common insult people aim at cyclists is ""entitled."" There's a pervasive feeling that cyclists are taking up room on something that fundamentally doesn't belong to them, that they didn't earn, that they're mooching roadspace. This kind of mentality is not only far from reality (bikes were here first, and bike advocacy literally paved the way for cars) but contributes to dangerous behavior in drivers. Anecdote: this weekend I went bike camping near Rainier, on the way back during a descent we hit ~36mph on a 30mph stretch of road and *still* had cars honking and a passenger lean out and tell us to get ""off the road faggots!"" - so we were speeding, not inconveniencing anyone, but because drivers see cyclists as some kind of entitled moochers they rage when they're behind us.

What other things in our life would we spend tens of thousands of dollars on yet we don't expect to last for more than 5-10 years), inefficient (look at how much componentry and engineering is required for even a motorbike) and they do a lot of damage to the paths they're limited to using (thinking Potholes and also 4-lane highway construction can cost $4-$6 million per mile in rural and suburban areas, $8-$10 million per mile in urban areas) and they [discourage local economy](http://usa.streetsblog.org/2012/03/23/why-bicyclists-are-better-customers-than-drivers-for-local-business/) - people driving cars are far less likely to stop and pop into a shop compared to cyclists, skaters and walkers.

"December is a WONDERFUL time to visit!  

Sometimes (but rarely) it snows.  I spent one December morning playing tourist.  It snowed, we got coffee, hot chocolate, and croissants across the street from the market; walked into the market and got hot nuts and donuts; browsed without the crowds.  Walked the waterfront.  At night, the lights, the carousel, etc.  It's a very different vibe than summer, yes; it will probably be cloudy, and daylight hours will be shorter, and it will probably mizzle on you (more than mist, less than drizzle).  You will want a nice raincoat with a hood, and good dry shoes.  But really, that's it.  And when we DO get a clear day, you can see forever (until we get several clear days in a row - then, pollution will build up.  But, a clear day or two is amazing.)  You don't have the huge line for the space needle or the EMP.  

If you want to go to Rainier, you have some options.  But, you will want four wheel drive and will need tire chains - no exceptions.  There are ski areas (Crystal), and you can always drive to the SW entrance mentioned by others. But local conditions and your vehicle will dictate how far in you can go.  Many roads close in November, but the SW entrance will PROBABLY let you get in a ways.   It entirely depends on the weather at the time.

I would recommend a visit to Leavenworth.  It's a very kitschy faux-Bavarian tourist town that, unless you are a hip cynic, can really be fun. Beautiful setting in the Cascade mountains, roads are kept up, access to winter activities, Christmas lights everywhere.  All the stops, in a setting out of a snow globe.  Or, even driving down interstate 90 in the winter is nice.  If it has been too snowy to get to Rainier (unlikely but not impossible), just driving over to the nearest mountain pass takes an hour -- and you go from the ocean, where it will probably just be damp and in the 40s F, up to the evergreen tree -filled mountains covered in snow.  Really, really beautiful.  Pass frozen waterfalls coming out of the rocks on the way.  If there is enough snow, there are maintained snow hills for sledding, or you can go snow-tubing.  

Absolutely visit in December, long as you have / don't mind acquiring a good raincoat and shoes.  You can play city/culture tourist or outdoorsy winter tourist, either one, or both on the same day.  I love it all year, love the awe-inspiring in-your-face beauty of summer, and love the less crowded, coffee-fueled cozy gray days of winter.

"&gt;everything I said is true and taught to forensic scientists understanding

I disagree. You're presenting this information as though forensic anthropology is a reliable way of telling race, but race (especially in the US) is rather fluid, the best you can do with forensic anthropology is make a better-than-random guess.

http://www.pbs.org/race/000_About/002_04-experts-01-09.htm

Relevant quote from [Alan H. Goodman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_H._Goodman)

&gt;Initially there were a number of forensic studies in which they tried to separate individuals into different so-called races depending on what they were looking at in the bones - size and shapes of skulls mostly. And they thought they had it. But when any of these studies has been replicated, looking at individuals from a different area or a different time, the results, sadly, are little better than random assignment.
&gt;I think the reason why this is true is very interesting. It really smacks at how fluid social definitions of race are and even how fluid, sometimes, biologies are. Biology can change, or at least phenotypes can change, from generation to generation. So if you did an initial study on say, bones of so-called blacks and whites in Cleveland, and then do a study of so-called blacks, whites, and Native Americans in Arizona, you actually find that the blacks in Arizona look different from the blacks in Cleveland. And the whites, in fact, look so different that one could even assign them into a different ""race."" In the same way, maybe, we could say Japanese immigrants look different once they come to the United States versus when they were in Japan.",,,,theKearney,,,1442472178,t5_2qhad,t3_3l8laa,t1_cv4g371,10,1444411634,0,0,cv4g66q,Seattle,10,,

"I recently read Ghettoside, a book about the epidemic of black on black murder in LA.  It was a real eye-opener on many fronts.  One of the final conclusions the author makes about what helped LA turn the corner on gang violence was the recent relaxing of standards for qualifying for social security disability benefits.  The author argues that many feel trapped in the revolving door of prison and gang life because they are really functionally disabled from pursuing legitimate work, but they still need money to survive and would really like to get out of gang life, and that the little bit of a financial safety net provided by the disability payments is just enough to keep them off the streets and out of the gangs.

It feels morally discouraging to just throw our hands up as a society up and say we give up on you, you are ""disabled"", here is some money now just stay off the streets, watch TV and stop killing each other.

It is a tough and tragic problem that deserves more thought than the racist dismissal it usually gets in the comment threads of the web.  Seattle is different from LA in so many ways, especially the historical roots of LA's gang culture in the black migration from the south, Louisiana in particular, vs. the east african immigrant culture in Seattle, that comparisons are difficult.  But some of it rings true, such as innocent youth being killed just for walking on the wrong street at the wrong time.

But anyways, Ghettoside was a well researched thought provoking read on the subject that I would recommend to anyone looking to understand the history behind black on black homicide, and more specifically how it was handled in LA.",,,,phinneypat,Phinney Ridge,,1442166735,t5_2qhad,t3_3krg2v,t3_3krg2v,11,1444337942,0,0,cv07iox,Seattle,11,,flair
"One thing I've never seen on the Utah program is what the long term statistics are on how many people are able to comply with the program rules and or move on to other housing.  Specifically how many are able to meet the requirement not to hurt anyone or bother their neighbors.  And what exactly happens to the ones that are kicked out for breaking rules.

The Utah program certainly looks promising, but the total numbers - less than 2000 chronically homeless residents served - seems really tiny compared to the numbers you'd find in West Coast cities.

On top of that, how has Utah managed this program so that people who would otherwise be short term homeless don't move there to get on the wait list?  There has to be something else going on to keep the numbers that low, but in all of the stories I've read it's never mentioned how they do it.

"Depends on what you want. Think of the Colonnade like going to the gym. It'll never match an actual hike in the woods or rock climbing or a trail run, but it will be conveniently located and sure to get your heart rate up and improve your fitness and skills. If you are into skinnies and jumps and stuff like that there is plenty to goof around on and you can session a single feature or area for quite a while. 

If you more want a nice ride where you get on a trail and ride it until the end, you'll quickly ride every route at the Colonnade and maybe get a bit bored, unless you challenge yourself like never putting a foot down, etc. 

Everyone should ride it at least once, it's a pioneering type of bike park and the success they had of getting it built directly lead to Duthie and the legitimacy of MTB trails as somethign worthwhile for a government entity to consider having as part of a park. 

I built a small part of a single switchback at Colonnade when volunteering on a work day way back when. I'll never look at a trail the same way again, it's tough to image how much work goes into something like that.

"Once again, nothing addressing affordability for middle class families. Mandatory Inclusion will remove 5-8% of new developments as set asides to low-income residents. Impact Mitigation costs are very low, so should have little effect on pricing, but that money goes to the aforementioned low-income housing.

The policies that would help middle class families- by actually increasing housing stock- are either absent (mother-in-law cottages, greater density in current single-family areas next to urban village centers), of the ""yeah, sure, we'll consider it"" variety (maybe we'll increase capacity), or incredibly weak (developers will only be able to add one additional floor, even in urban villages, and only an extra 1000 sq ft per floor in downtown/SLU?

"While I understand the reasoning, I definitely sense some passing of the buck here. The Secret Service has no legal authority over the governor or Washington DOT (unless they want to arrest them for counterfeiting or some other US treasury crime).

The fault lies with our state officials. The roads were closed because of the DOT's decision to comply with what is nothing more than a request from a federal agency and a foreign dignitary.

The next time the president of China says he wants to drive on the freeways, inform him that you won't be closing them and that you recommend he arrange alternate travel to ensure his safety. If the Secret Service says they need to close roads, tell them to get a court order.

These men were trying to blend into a crowd. Police were not stereotyping or using excessive force. Bystanders didn't have all the details.""

I don't think this follows from that: ""stop with the 'Black Lives Matter' crap,"" he told Rantz. ""Stop it. All lives matter."" So, I guess the best I can say is that he didn't quite understand the significance of what he was saying, and made a blanket statement about a movement without fully understanding the context?

"I know that developers don't give a $hit, it's just business in a trade where the resource (land in the city) is zero sum (ergo any work = destroying something established).

What is sad is that a lot of other people who argue the ""big deal, those places are gross"" or, ""they'll just put another bar in there anyway"" point of view don't understand that a city is more than a generic set of services in some layout dictated by needs, traveling patterns, and population. It's not like resource based video games where the ""thing"" (e.g. a barracks or smithy) always looks the same.  It's more than ""I want a beer, and there is a bar, so I will go to that bar"". It's a complex mix of the specific service, the ambiance, and the people who utilize it. In some places, like those that you spend certain types of time in (leisure, dating, exercise, grocery shopping etc.) you are likely to be attracted or repulsed by this culture mix. Buying gas... maybe not so much (price + convenience may drive that). 

Treating places like bars as if they were in a more purely functional class like gas stations is a common way that I have seen people argue that the passing of the shithole that is Shorty's is not a big deal. It's also the argument of ""mixed-use is king"" (because it is functional). It's a flawed argument because it fails to incorporate or value the idea of culture, subculture, microculture and instead engages in false equivalence (all bars have beer, ergo all bars are the same OR the old bar here had Mannys and the new bar here has Mannys ergo nobody should bitch). That might work for a gas station, but it does not work for places with a deep culture. 

Shorty's is a dump. The Lava Lounge is a pit. But it's our dump, our pit. 

Knocking that down without recognizing the structure is more than bricks and paint, booze and stale air is a disservice and a lazy and dangerous way to justify progress (whatever that means). Killing those businesses means killing a part of what makes that area that area - of what makes that space MORE than any other random space of the same dimensions. You also can't just move that a few blocks away or over to LQA or wherever and believe that the culture is retained (it could be, but it's not as simple as often made out to be). Aspects of what make Seattle, and specific neighborhoods (or parts of them) attractive to a diverse set of people require us to think about what the true cost of shitcanning an established area means, and what the impact will be from a cultural point of view. It's difficult, it's qualitative, and as such it's uncomfortable and more easy to ignore. 

Capitalism doesn't care about culture, and in some ways that's ok. It just means we need to think outside of a capitalistic mindset if we want to consider culture (and I believe we should). 

Again, Shorty's is a dump. The Lava Lounge is a pit. But it's our dump, our pit. ",,,,ManDrone,,,1441505609,t5_2qhad,t3_3jrt9h,t3_3jrt9h,12,1444196180,0,0,cus3mog,Seattle,12,,

"&gt; How did we end up with such a rudimentary fare card

The contract for ORCA is now 12 years old.  Even though the system came out of pilot in 2009, it was built using 2003-2006 technology.  The functional spec for the system required that it be able to handle multiple fare types, multiple times of day, multiple agencies, and use a very tiny amount of wireless infrastructure.

It is supposed to be extensible and have the ability to do upgrades, but that requires the cooperation and payment the of seven different standalone agencies that make up the Central Puget Sound Regional Fare Coordination Board.  (Line to file your questions about whether we need this many agencies or if it is balanced by having local control forms to the right.)

The biggest problem with ORCA is that all terminals aren't in real-time communication with the mothership.  The 24-48 hour reload time you noticed is also about how long it takes for transactions with an ORCA card to show up on the web site.  This is because most terminals--the ones on buses--do not have a way to actually talk back to the larger system until the bus returns to base.  Transaction data is downloaded there while the bus sits overnight.  Card reload data is also pushed to terminals at the same time.  The only immediate-access terminals are the ORCA vending machines and *some* RapidRide stops.

Real-time communication was deemed far too expensive and cumbersome for the project.  At the time, putting cellular radios in all of them would have been a massive operational expense.  Putting licensed radios, like telemetry devices on an FCC-granted frequency, would have meant making the machines even more specialized.  Could we do it today?  Sure, but it would still cost a lot of money and people would ask why that money isn't being put into transit service.  Politically, just like with rebuilding roads or making bridges safer, it's difficult to say ""check out the thing we spent $8 million on; you don't notice any difference but it actually is a lot more neat now"" versus cutting ribbons on new or expanded service.

&gt; is there any push to improve the current system?

Yes, but it will move very slowly.  That MAX in Oregon decided to not join ORCA was seen as a big blow.  That Pierce Transit is back to handing out paper passes for their daily transit pass is also a blow.  However, remember that it took 5 years from ""let's do this"" to ""tada, ORCA!""

"Nah, I don't have a card with points or mileage. I use the standard ol' debit card. From the manager's position I can understand the cost of processing a check or whatever book keeping work would need to be done with cash, but at the same time, I'd like very much to know if there's going to be an extra $28 built into my rent.

Edit: if I may be blunt, the cost issue is a concern for me, but I'm also increasingly done with my life here and I'm hoping I can negotiate an exit from my lease. My extended family that I moved to the PNW for have effectively disowned me since coming out - thereby dissolving my support system overnight, my job is paying me far less than implied when I accepted my transfer (I'm now not making my student loan payments to get by), and I may not be able to continue working my job soon anyway, since I'm going to be asked to start a shift at 3 am, and I won't be able to reach it on Metro. I question my ability to land a decent job in this market, and as dismal as St Louis can be, I'd move back just to have some friends and relatives who support me again.

"This is the cutest thing ever! The two places I'm most familiar with are Princess Nails on 15th ave W in Interbay and Julep. They just do manis and pedis; you get to pick a color or two, they soak your feet, scrub them up and then paint your toes. Im not sure on kid pricing but I know they do kids, adults are $10 mani and $20 pedi. This place has very friendly staff, they clean their tools every time and they are very affordable, additionally they do a very good job. 

Julep is much, MUCH more expensive but I think they do kids a little cheaper. Julep has a good website and typically requires an appointment at busy times like the weekend. Their website is pretty helpful www.julep.com/parlor-services.html For the first one I would call right when they open tomorrow at 10am to try to get an appointment. Have fun!

EDIT: Fixed the link.  Also, another idea that would be fun to do with a 7 year old and is cheaper for you, is to have a spa day at home.  You could go to the store together and pick out a few nail polishes, and you could paint each others nails.  If you wanted to get really fancy you could get some face masks (they sell them at any drug store or Fred Meyer type place), or washout/temporary hair dye, bath bombs to use for soaking feet, or you could make your own lip gloss. You could also make face masks, there are tons of easy ones to make with ingredients that are cheap and sometimes staples.   I've used the Kool-Aid lipgloss recipe before which is just heated vaseline and Kool-Aid mixed together, as well as one similar to this recipe: https://emilybphotography.wordpress.com/2012/03/01/homemade-lip-balm-oh-yes/   Sorry the blog i referenced is so annoying, I have no idea who that person is it was just the first option that came up on pinterest that I recognized!",,,,pinkforgetmenots,,,1442048009,t5_2qhad,t3_3kn36i,t3_3kn36i,11,1444314240,0,0,cuyu44w,Seattle,11,,

"Happy to go into more detail:

There are very several types of rent control, however historically it has primarily been rent increase limitations so I'll focus on that. In a nutshell, limitations prevent landlords from raising the rent more than a certain percentage every year. Let's assume it's a 5% annual rental increase cap.

The end result is that rental properties that were at market rates and renting for $1000 a month will be able to increase their rents by $50/mo annually. Those that were already far below rental rates due to lazy owners, or incompetent managers, might be at say $500/mo. They will only be able to increase the rent by $25/mo annually. This encourages landlords to put NO money into the units because there is no incentive! *Why would you upgrade a unit if you can't rent it for more money?* Suddenly, all owners who were lax about their rents are now incentivized to become slumlords. 

Maybe a unit gets a rodent problem, or has a poor insulation, or a slow leak somewhere. The tenant isn't going to move and if they do the owner will rent it in a heartbeat. Those that were at $500/mo will take 15 years to get rents up to what was the market rate of $1000/mo!! This doesn't provide more housing and it adds a reason for those who are in cheap housing to never move. 

The best fix is to add incentives for builders to increase supply. Rent costs are driven by the costs of land, construction, financing, and demand. When a builder decides to build a project, they have to balance the costs with potential rent revenue. If rent potential is too low, a project won’t pencil and banks, lenders, and other funders won’t put money into the project. More housing means cheaper rents - lets make our city more affordable in the long run rather than jump on such a short-sighted solution.",,,,JMace,Fremont,,1442965306,t5_2qhad,t3_3ly639,t1_cvart08,35,1444523484,0,0,cvase5k,Seattle,35,,flair

They absolutely WERE NOT. Every single news source said that it applies to everyone who works within the city without exemptions, and from the little I heard regarding how the law affects Delta, all the news outlets believed that Delta was included.

[From one of many sources:](http://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/blog/2015/08/seattle-port-alaska-air-say-theyre-reviewing.html)

&gt;If that fear does prove correct, it could create economic difficulties for Alaska , which uses Sea-Tac Airport as its major hub and is fighting off inroads from the larger Delta Air Lines. Though the wage would apply to all workers at the airport, it would hit Alaska harder because Alaska is based in SeaTac, while Delta and other airlines have fewer employees here.

"you're incorrect about a some of the stuff you posted:

&gt; Yesterday they counter-proposed a 10% raise over 2 years, just half a percent above the city's initial offer of 9.5% and waaay below their strike-inducing 19% demand over 3 years. One could say their back is broken.

The 10% over two years is not just over the district's original offer, because that was over three years, not two.  Also, I'd argue that the district's refusal to negotiate over the summer at all is what is ""strike-inducing"".

&gt; 1) ""fair evaluations"": this doesn't help students, mainly just perpetuates seniority-based comp.

Fair evaluations is extremely important for teachers AND students.  Right now student performance in standardized tests is something the district wants in teacher evaluations, and on the surface that might seem fine and dandy, but what it does is promote teachers to do two things: 1) teach to the tests rather than teach the material and 2) get teachers to avoid lower performing students/classrooms at all costs.  My wife has a passion for teaching lower performing and minority students and she's very good at it (based on student and supervisor reviews), but using these unfair evaluation standards, she would be evaluated as a ""poor"" teacher because she has students who perform poorly on these exams for a variety of reasons (including some that are out of their control like being homeless and unable to do homework)

&gt; 2) ""no working more for free"": they don't want the 30min longer day installed by the district; working parents, many of whom have to work longer these days themselves without cost of living adjustments or the luxury of collective bargaining, will find this tone deaf.

The proposal by the district was that the teachers should have their working day increased by 30 minutes (about 7%) with no increase in compensation because of it.  In fact, it wouldn't be until year three of the districts proposal that they would even be back to where they were at the start.  No one should be forced to work more for less (or the same) amount of money, and it's up to you to be ""tone deaf"" to this or not, but I've seen much more support than opposition for the teachers.

&gt; 3) ""less standardized testing"": this is a decoy designed to paint the strike as being about the kids. The union would concede this one in a heartbeat for a quarter percent.

The teachers hate standardized testing, and absolutely care about what's best for students.  If they didn't, most of them wouldn't be in a job where they can be vilified so often and easily by the media and those they work for.  Standardized testing again forces teachers to teach to tests rather than teach material, and no, those two things aren't the same thing.  Also, there is considerable evidence that standardized tests are unfair to some minority populations.  These are things that teachers care a lot about, and unless you work for the union, you have no idea what they would ""concede this one in a heartbeat for a quarter percent.""

&gt; 4) ""student equity"" for activities across schools: this is another throw-in. They'll compromise on this one with some minor changes and both claim victory

Not sure what you mean by this here, but like I said, I do know that student equity is a very important issue to most teachers.

&gt; 5) ""workload relief"": not many jobs get a blanket 10% raise over 2 years... again, no sympathy from the public.

Not many jobs don't get any raise for 6 years in a row which is the situation that teachers are currently in.  IF the teachers had gotten the 19% raise over three years, people might cry out about how much that is, but if you factor in the previous 6 years then over the 9 years total (6 years until now and 3 years into this contract) then you'd be looking at just 1.85%/year roughly, which doesn't even cover inflation.

It seems like you're not sympathetic to what the teachers want here, and that's totally within your rights.  But consider this: even if you feel like the teachers are asking for a lot, I think we can agree that we want the best quality, best trained and most passionate people that we can get in this job.  In my opinion, a great way to do this is make the job more desirable, and working conditions and money are a good way to do this.

"Voting against progressive, forward-thinking development isn't ""rational"" - it is myopic and short-sighted. ""Rational"" in this case is your subjective opinion. So why was it rational to vote for the Kingdome in 1968 but not transit?

Locals have continued to vote against forward-thinking transit and progressive funding plans:

* In [1972](http://metro.kingcounty.gov/am/history/history-1970.html) voters allow a small transit tax for busses, but reject the tax for electric rail. (Even the meager vote for busses was the first time Seattleites approved new taxes for transit since 1918)  

* In [1995](http://metro.kingcounty.gov/am/history/history-1990.html), voters reject a Regional Transit Authority (later Sound Transit) measure for a gigantic, $6.7 billion transportation system over three counties that would’ve featured commuter rail, light rail, express buses, and expanded HOV lanes 

* In 1999, with Initiative 695, local voters show their love of Tim Eyman and regressivism- scrapping the progressive car excise fee for a super-regressive $30 state car tabs. Since 29% of the vehicle excise tax went to local transit, local communities have been scrambling to keep their buses running ever since. 

* In 2002, voters showed their hatred of forward-thinking transit/infrastructure funding and support an Eyman initiative yet again: voters approved I-776,which restricted local governments from adding their own excise taxes and limited local license tab fees. While the measure was shot down at first for being unconstitutional, it was upheld by the State Supreme Court in October 2003. 776 repealed many taxes that the public had [already voted on](https://researchcouncil.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/initiative776.pdf)  

* In [2005](http://www.seattlepi.com/local/transportation/article/Monorail-will-go-to-voters-for-5th-time-1183631.php), Mayor Nickels gets the ""all-or-nothing"" plan for a West Seattle-Ballard monorail on the ballot. The plan is a watered down, poor version of the original, so it failed. Its rejection gutted Seattle Monorail Partners, which had been working to upgrade our transit system since they were created by a public vote in 1997. Council President Jan Drago (accurately) expressed fear that not building the monorail segment means ""we will pass it to future generations."" **Now look where we are!** 

* In [2011](http://seattlest.com/2011/07/13/last_night_people_are_voting_with_t.php): The Congestion Reduction Fee. When our regressive and outdated sales tax revenue plummets during the recession – the King County Council approves a $20 fee on vehicle tabs to make up the $60 million deficit, collected in 2012  through 2014  

* In [2014](http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/with-transit-money-approved-seattle-pledges-to-spend-new-dollars-well/), Seattleites vote *FOR* maintaining some bus transit, with more regressive taxes - a $60 car-tab fee and a 0.1 percent sales-tax increase - to keep many bus lines from being cut and to expand services on a couple bus lines.

"First thought - the places where you can enter and exit the lanes will be interesting. There is a spot going south on 405 just before the 520 bridge where it looked a bit like one of the express lanes split in two lanes (one express, one not) and then merged back into a single express lane shortly after? I was driving along side it so I'm not 100% sure if I'm right but if so, I'm curious how that came about. I can imagine some confusion/accidents there. Again though, this is all based on a single trip south. The roads were fairly empty so I'm not sure how much traffic congestion will obscure the entrance/exit lane marking.

Figuring out where to exit the express lane if you are trying to get to an exit on the right will be interesting. I don't think there is much of an indicator other than the marking on the road. Some freeway exits have corresponding express lane exits but not all of them.

"&gt; I'm pretty sure the garbage guys work for Waste Management, so they don't work directly for the city. Driving miles out of my way to find non-striking grocery stores is definitely an inconvenience, but I did it happily -- I won't cross picket lines. So no, I don't only support strikes that minimally affect me and fuck you for accusing me of that.

So waste management is contracted by the city and that's a huge difference?  Sounds like parsing to me, but if you could explain the difference, I'd appreciate it because I don't see it.  Sorry if I insulted you, but it certainly appears based on your posting that you have something specific against the idea of the teachers having a union as compared to anyone else, and I don't see why they shouldn't be allowed to collectively bargain, especially when they're bargaining with a de-facto monopoly.

&gt; My kid is old enough to be by himself during the day so this affects me personally a lot less than a grocery store strike -- but think of the single mom with an hourly job and no one to watch her kid tomorrow. But I guess people like her don't count in your noble struggle.

While I totally appreciate your snark and your swearing at me, I absolutely believe that you and the single moms and the teacher parents all count.  I think that in the long run, getting a quality contract for teachers will be better for all of us because it will mean better education.  And I'm not seeing why you're only mad at the teachers union here when it's the district that has refused to come to the table since the bargaining began and who waited until a few weeks ago to reject all of the unions proposals without any counter offer.  In the months I've been watching this, I've seen one side put up every roadblock to negotiations that they could, and never work in good faith but you don't seem to hold them accountable at all.

&gt; It's bullshit because teachers are supposed to be professionals, and they are intentionally using the mantle of labor and demanding public support when they are actively hurting our entire society by striking. I know a lot of teachers don't like the union, but they have NO CHOICE but to belong, and if they don't follow the strike, their careers and lives are ruined by teachers' union bullies.

Every strike is in some way supposed to be an inconvenience.  The teachers were forced into this by the actions of the district.  Striking is something that no one wants, not even the teachers.

&gt; So, yeah the teachers union sucks, and the strike sucks, and it's total bullshit.

I agree with you, but I think for different reasons and from the wrong side.

okay if you are going to say you have a 2015 BMW M6, which I know retails for 100k+, why are you going to act like saving up $500 for vacation is a huge deal? That's a very sincere and genuine gesture to say you will donate that money for something that isn't related to you at all, but the comments together just make me shake my head.

Good evening. While the make and model of my vehicle, my net worth or my earnings are not the a matter I usually discuss freely, I'll engage with you and give you some insight as to how I own such a car.

I do not make enough money to have purchased a car in this price range. I was bequeathed a home from my late grandfather last year. As I rent a home, I liquidated said home and, with the earnings, I purchased what was my dream item. I used a once-in-a-lifetime situation and put it into something that made me happy. For perspective, I don't believe with my income that I would be able to ever be behind the wheel of this car. The car made me happy, which is what my grandfather had in mind in leaving me his residence.

Five-hundred dollars is the absolute maximum, at this point in my life, is the best I can do to help a stranger in what has to be a very low point in their life. I'm using the funds I had set aside for nearly six months for this purpose.

"I'm not sure why this hasn't been mentioned yet, but getting cars out of the HOV lane was *exactly the point* of adding tolling.

In order to maintain funding for HOV lanes at all from the federal government, there needs to be a minimum speed maintained by vehicles during peak hours--45 mph. Too many cars in the HOV on 405 meant that cars were typically going less than that, so this was the ""easy"" solution of reducing traffic in the short-term in HOV lanes to retain that funding.

Edit: I was slightly mistaken. The tolls were implemented partially to raise funds for maintenance, and partially because of a **state** mandate that cars be maintaining 45 MPH at least 90% of the time during peak hours. Here's a quote from the [Seattle Transit Blog's post](http://seattletransitblog.com/2014/01/31/wsdot-makes-funding-recommendations-for-405-express-toll-lanes/) on it:

&gt;The latter recommendation is important because state law mandated that the project bring in enough in tolls to recoup operating expenses within two years, or be shut down. The legislature also stipulated that the lanes must maintain speeds of 45 miles per hour at least 90 percent of the time during peak periods.  This is important, because the current 2-person HOV lane has been failing in this regard, hurting transit on the corridor.",,,,SovietJugernaut,Eastlake,,1443646121,t5_2qhad,t3_3mzwq9,t3_3mzwq9,76,1444677848,0,0,cvjqj67,Seattle,76,,flair

Ex - worked with 14 year old son of assistant US attorney
http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/boy-with-app-helps-police-catch-burglary-suspect-within-minutes/

Officers recovered $4,000 worth of electronics stolen from the North Capitol Hill home in which Malkin, an assistant U.S. attorney, lives with his wife, Jennifer Porter, and their sons, Max and Leo, 11.
... several items were missing — his U.S. Justice Department-issued BlackBerry, his wife’s iPhone, his iPad, a MacBook and an iPod Nano, as well as the family’s Xbox and Wii game systems. Also gone were $150 in cash and a brown, rolling duffel bag Malkin had bought for his wife’s upcoming trip to Europe.

For what it's worth, maybe you should make a big stink contacting O'Toole and see if you get any traction (from Nov 2014):

http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/spd-vows-to-track-stolen-devices-as-another-victim-tells-story/

*Within days, police announced they would review how property crimes are handled. And on Friday, Seattle Police Chief Kathleen O’Toole announced creation of a position to help patrol officers track down stolen phones and other GPS-enabled electronic devices.*

*According to the news release, officers will be able to call on a supervisor in the department’s Technical and Electronic Support Unit to guide them through the technically and legally complex process of zeroing in on a stolen phone.*

*“Officers will now have a new resource available to help them locate stolen phones and get warrants, as they search for smartphones stolen in robberies, thefts and car prowls,” police said in the statement.*

**edit upon reflection of krankjanker's comment**
Some officers may well care, but there aren't enough hours in the day nor police on the force to actually enforce these laws.  It's sad, as it's one of the few opportunities for one of the most common non-momentary interactions with the police to be positive to a taxpayer (as opposed to being fined for speeding, parking, etc).  These GPS-enabled cases being ""triaged"" to actually follow those GPS-capable devices and where criminals retreat are an enticing way to put a dent in property crime though.",,,,ChefJoe98136,West Seattle,,1442110139,t5_2qhad,t3_3kqcu5,t3_3kqcu5,33,1444327635,0,0,cuzm942,Seattle,33,,flair

Edit: not to hijack the thread but here's some background. The reason these are getting so big this time of year is because their insect prey is getting old and tired. They're taking advantage of the natural weakening of flies, bees, hornets, moths etc. The white cross is made of distasteful crystals that may help protect the spider from predators. This kind of spider coexists peacefully with humans from LA to Vladivostok. They typically make their webs at night and can be inactive during the day.

&gt;* In 1999, with Initiative 695, local voters show their love of Tim Eyman and regressivism- scrapping the progressive car excise fee for a super-regressive $30 state car tabs. Since 29% of the vehicle excise tax went to local transit, local communities have been scrambling to keep their buses running ever since. 

Initiative 695 was a statewide initiative. I don't have numbers for Seattle itself, but King County voted against it, according to the Secretary of State website.


&gt;* In 2002, voters showed their hatred of forward-thinking transit/infrastructure funding and support an Eyman initiative yet again: voters approved I-776,which restricted local governments from adding their own excise taxes and limited local license tab fees. While the measure was shot down at first for being unconstitutional, it was upheld by the State Supreme Court in October 2003. 776 repealed many taxes that the public had [already voted on](https://researchcouncil.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/initiative776.pdf)

"&gt;And in regards to your comment about affluent and middle class people being loud and rude? It is not as likely they do that in their community, as they have put blood, sweat, tears and their own hard earned cash into their property.

Here are some examples I have personally seen or experienced:

* Sitting outside one of my former places, neighbor across the street (who has been living in her house for over 40 years) with in her yard with her two Chihuahua-sized dogs. Bro comes jogging past with his dog, hers start barking and he stops, tells her to 'put her fucking dogs on a leash' and that he would 'report her to the police for violations'. Sure, she *should* have had her dogs on a leash. But his approach was rude, unnecessarily aggressive, and made that nice little White appeal to authority.

* A couple moved in next door to me with two kids. Their first order of business was to build a gigantic fence. That's absolutely okay, but it sends a great message to everyone else in the neighborhood. Next order of business was to remove all of the plants and trees the bordered ours. I saw them doing it, commented that I really enjoyed those plants and was sad to see them go. Response? ""This is our property, we can do what we like."" Well, sure, but fuck that response. They called the fire department on our house for a completely legal firepit we were using at 9PM on a weeknight. They come over to complain any time the garbage trucks leave our bins on ""their"" side of the fence that they built.

I have more, but these are just two examples of how the sword cuts both ways.

"It is not an armored vehicle. If lane widths are properly designed per city/county specs, then lane widths wouldn't be a problem for these vehicles. They are big and do have the ability to do damage to most any vehicle that they come into contact with... but so do buses and 18 wheelers. 

As for the city allowing it? I am sure that we will see measures taken to ban/boycott the businesses who run these amphibious vehicles moving forward, as other cities have done. Hopefully this only effects businesses as our very own Seafair Pirates operate one of these vehicles: The Moby Duck.

"reddit tourist tip: if your destination is large enough for a thriving subreddit then most likely they have dedicated some sidebar/wiki space recommending what tourists should do/eat.

we are being inundated with questions such as yours a couple times a day, every day, which explains the downvotes.

"I edited the title a bit because the original was a bit too long and not very clear. This is only a proposal and it would be a huge engineering challenge (lots of terraces which would mean huge concrete walls that need carvings and murals to be pretty), but it would be an amazing achievement.

Also, the current view from Lakeview Boulevard is spectacular and it needs more exposure.
