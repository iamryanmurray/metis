"Article Text:

The next few days in the Puget Sound region will be cold and dry, according to the National Weather Service.
The temperature in Seattle won’t rise above the mid-30s, meteorologist Dustin Guy said. And the cold snap is expected to last through the weekend.

Temperatures across the region are expected to drop into the lower 30s on Friday and into subfreezing territory on Saturday, Guy said.

“We’ve some very cold days ahead,” Guy said. “But by next week we expect temperatures will return to normal for this time of year.”
On Wednesday, a snowstorm pounded the Portland area, snarling traffic and leaving thousands of commuters stranded.

Meanwhile, dangerously cold temps grip the Upper Midwest in advance of a storm that’s expected to bring several inches of snow in coming days.

Another arctic air mass on the heels of this cold front is expected to bring temperatures to the northern Plains over the weekend and into early next week that will be as much as 24 degrees below normal, according to Stephen Baxter, a climate prediction center forecaster.",,,,WickedGingerMan,,,1481826823,t5_2qhad,t3_5ii58r,t3_5ii58r,15,1483790543,0,0,db8j7a9,Seattle,,,
"Bellingham is a personal favorite of mine, much of the positive qualities of Seattle without the terrible traffic and skyrocketing rent. Someone else mentioned Eugene, that would be good as well though I'm not as familiar with it.

Outside of PNW, if you're in it more for nature than nightlife, Santa Fe or Albuquerque in New Mexico could also be good: it doesn't get too terribly hot in the summer and not bone-chilling cold in winter either.

"With only 3 WHEREAS justifications directly referencing DAPL / Standing Rock, and 7 directly referencing the fraudulent account scandal, I think it might be a bit disingenuous for either the source article or the OP to claim that the this divestment was ""over Standing Rock"", implying it was the sole motivator.

Here are the full list of WHEREAS's the bill includes as the justification/context.

Source: [Bill, full text](https://seattle.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=2907331&amp;GUID=C1EDC3A7-433F-42CE-9843-7C0ECB1F28D0&amp;Options=Advanced&amp;Search=&amp;FullText=1).

&gt; WHEREAS, the financial security and stability of The City of Seattle’s deposits and investments is a priority of the Seattle City Council; and

&gt; WHEREAS, the Seattle City Council passed Resolution 31337 in 2011, committing the City to take steps to minimize economic insecurity and destructive disparities including reviewing its banking and investment practices to ensure that public funds are invested in responsible financial institutions that support our community; and

&gt; WHEREAS, the Seattle City Council passed Ordinance 124250 in 2013, adding Chapter 20.65 to the Seattle Municipal Code, requiring the Director of Finance and Administrative Services to consider certain socially responsible banking practices as bid criteria, utilizing socially responsible banking performance as an evaluation factor worth at least 15 percent, and requiring data and reporting about socially responsible banking practices in The City of Seattle’s banking contracts; and

&gt; WHEREAS, the Seattle City Council passed Resolution 31525 in 2014, adopting revised City of Seattle Investment Policies, including Policy 4, Social Policies, which guides the Director of Finance and Administrative Services to seek opportunities to conduct business with institutions that by their charter, seek to benefit the common good and do not solely pursue maximum profit when managing the City’s investments; and

&gt; WHEREAS, the Seattle City Council is aware of recent reports that senior management of Wells Fargo Bank (“Wells Fargo”) directed employees to fraudulently create more than 2,000,000 unauthorized bank and credit card accounts during the past five years, negatively affecting the credit ratings of millions of customers across the United States; and

&gt; WHEREAS, those reports indicate Wells Fargo financially benefited from these illegally created accounts and encouraged the continuation of these fraudulent practices by rewarding managers and senior executives with multimillion-dollar bonuses; and

&gt; WHEREAS, it is also reported that senior management of Wells Fargo was aware of these fraudulent practices, with Chief Executive Officer John Stumpf admitting in Congressional testimony that he first learned about the unauthorized accounts in 2013; and

&gt; WHEREAS, Wells Fargo has agreed to pay restitution and a total of $185 million in penalties to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the City and County of Los Angeles - the largest penalties ever imposed by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the City and County of Los Angeles - to settle claims related to these reports that it defrauded its customers; and

&gt; WHEREAS, in addition to the settlement, it is reported that Wells Fargo has terminated the employment of more than 5,300 of the corporation’s lowest-paid workers, but has not fired a single senior executive; and

&gt; WHEREAS, investigations into whether Wells Fargo’s misconduct also included additional criminal or discriminatory acts are ongoing; and

&gt; WHEREAS, the Mayor of Seattle, joined by the City Council President and the Council Budget Chair, recently authored a letter to Wells Fargo, directing the City to discontinue negotiations with Wells Fargo as lender on the $100 million bond financing for Seattle City Light because of a loss of confidence that Wells Fargo is a trusted business partner after the reports of these recent settlements and Wells Fargo’s dishonest business practices; and

&gt; WHEREAS, Wells Fargo, pursuant to a competitive procurement in 2013, currently provides services to The City of Seattle under the Contract for Bank Depository Services between The City of Seattle and Wells Fargo with an initial contract term through December 31, 2018, including managing more than $3 billion of Seattle’s operating account, including a biweekly payroll of $30 million for approximately 12,000 employees; and

&gt; WHEREAS, the Seattle City Council passed Resolution 31709 in 2016, proclaiming the City of Seattle’s Support for the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe’s Opposition to the Construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline; and

&gt; WHEREAS, Food and Water Watch reported on September 6, 2016, that Wells Fargo is one of the largest contributors to the Dakota Access Pipeline, having invested $467,000,000 in project-level loans and revolving credit, which has enabled the repression and intimidation against the nearly 200 Indian Nations, environmental organizations, journalists and other non-violent demonstrators; and

&gt; WHEREAS, the Seattle City Council finds that Wells Fargo’s investment in the Dakota Access Pipeline and recent misconduct and dishonest business practices are contrary to The City of Seattle’s strong commitment to conducting its business with socially responsible banks, and sets forth a framework to ensure that The City of Seattle does not engage in business with a banking institution that has a demonstrated pattern of dishonest or unfair business practices including deceiving, defrauding, and duping its customers; NOW THEREFORE...

"I agree with you on helping them.  Even from a purely economic perspective, (ignoring the humanitarian aspect) we're going to pay for the homeless either way.

They're the people who refuse to pay for schools now, then scream for prisons later.  

I wish I could explain to them that helping the homeless is actually working in their own best interest.  Needle exchanges result in fewer needles lying in the streets and lower rates of disease transmission.  Homeless shelters result in fewer people sleeping on public streets.  Mental health care gets people incapable of caring for themselves into safe places where they can't be the perpetrators or (far more likely) victims of crimes.  All of these programs are actually *less* expensive than dealing with associated negative repercussions further down the line.

If you're an idealist, and you want to help the homeless, that's great.  If you aren't, help them because by helping them, you're actually helping yourself.

We need to get past the idea that everyone in this country is in this completely for themselves.  Like it or not, we're all in this together, and we need to help the people at the bottom in order to help everyone.

"&gt; There is literally nowhere on earth it's better to be a woman, gay, or whatever, than here

 ""better"" doesn't mean good, it's very relative.

I'm going to go out on a limb and assume you are none of these things. (Sorry if I am wrong) Neither am I but I know there are a tons of people who are, who feel that this is still a shitty place to be any of them.  They are also people who don't feel like they can speak out because they'll just feel more persecution so we don't hear their voices. That is my privilege, I never _have_ to hear about that.  But I've been trying to listen more and I see it's there.

Just look at gender income inequality studies or suicide stats for closeted gay people or youth (youth!) and say this is a great place to be either.

| Many might argue that it's better to be a woman here than a man,

Ok we can't actually have a discussion anymore.  We'll just have to agree to disagree. It may suck to be a man, but look across all attributes and it's so much harder to be a women.  Male privilege doesn't mean it's easy.  It just means that women have a lot more things to work through than men.  

I simply can't continue this conversation if you're going to hold to this belief as it's too fundamental a difference in our views and the internet is not how we are going to bridge that. Thank you for your view points though. (note I wrote this after everything else)

I will offer this though. As a straight white affluent male it helped me understand privilege.  I'd ask that you at least read it.

I can't remember where, but somewhere I read something to the effect of: American's don't want to think they're actually in the lower class and few people want to admit they're on some sort of federal/state benefit system. At least not permanently. They want to think that their current situation is only because the current economy is keeping them down. That it's rigged at the top. And Trump absolutely played to this belief (and to a degree, so did Obama in his first campaign). Clinton was probably more realistic, but hey, lots of people don't want to get a dose of reality if it doesn't sound good to them.",,,,notcaffeinefree,,,1480983413,t5_2qhad,t3_5go5mr,t1_dau23d0,16,1483505037,0,0,dau2qze,Seattle,,,

"&gt; In statements and interviews immediately after the incident, Erickson and his partner Olson James said Phillips “fell” off the curb as the officer attempted to “escort” her to his patrol vehicle. “Once on the ground with Phillips, I affected an arrest for the attempted assault on myself,” Erickson wrote in his report on the incident.

&gt; After many hours of interviewing the involved officers and witnesses, Witmer agreed. He wrote in his report that Phillips “fell forward” and caused her own injury:

&gt; As Officer Erickson pulled subject Phillips’ right arm toward him for control, Phillips fell forward causing Officer Erickson to take her straight to the ground. Subject Phillips’ sustained a facial injury to her chin that began to bleed.

&gt; An EMT who responded to the scene to treat Phillips said in her interview she was told the woman “essentially threw herself” onto the ground.

Not all white-skinned people are European, but all white-skinned people now garner the benefits.

What is White anyway?  It's not a race; it's not even a physical region. ""Caucasian"" is but even that had to be co-opted by western europeans before it was co-opted by americans.  We even stole that.  Nothing original it seems.

"The last city I lived in built busways. 

Completely separate roads only for buses that bypassed some of the heaviest congestion.

It used under passes, over passes, reclaimed some of the unused center divides between highways and even used tunnels to get busses around congestion and back to the side streets and suburbs that they serviced. 

It worked really well at reducing transit time and making buses far more reliable.

At first I didn't think it was worth the investment. I wondered if light rail would be a better choice. But then after seeing how the network changed to allow buses to hit hubs that interconnected specific bus bridges and busways I saw it improved the speed that all buses directed into the city moved so much faster. Buses that ran south and north all benefited by not sitting in traffic. The bus hubs benefited with shops and services. Need keys cut? iPhone repair? Snack? Light meal? Quick groceries? Hop on a bus that only sits in traffic near you then connects to a busways then to the bus hub where businesses are anyway. 

It improved the economy of local areas by allowing people to access services without sitting in traffic or looking for a park.

"Since you seem to be in earnest, I'll try to curb my frustration and give you an honest response.  Speaking only for myself, it is upsetting because you aren't just choosing to take those measures for yourself - you are projecting them onto others, to the point where you are taking the position that a TSA agent is doing something wrong by setting a blanket on a conveyor belt.  Current TSA practices often frustrate me because they are unreasonable, but you are being at least as unreasonable in my opinion.  

You can do whatever you want with your own time and energy, but you don't deserve a pass from the people and institutions you interact with just because you have a kid and have decided to take this extreme approach.  If it were my job to screen you for access to a secure area which you were voluntarily entering with your child, I would not be willing to accept requirements like 'and none of your baby's possessions will touch anything which hasn't been sterilized' as something it was reasonable to require of me.

From a bigger picture perspective, your whole approach is frustrating to me because children who are coddled and overprotected to such a ridiculous degree seem more likely to become the kind of people I don't want to interact with in society - the kind who think they deserve everyone around them to go out of our way to be accommodating to their desires.

"&gt;proper socialism

you have no fucking idea what you're talking about. there are all kinds of socialism. calling the USSR ""proper socialism"" just illustrates your ignorance. what if I were to call the Paris Commune, the Ukrainian Free Territory, Anarchist Spain, or the territories of Chiapas under Zapatismo ""proper socialism?"" Huh, then I guess things look *completely different.* Even from state-capitalist to state-capitalist country things looked completely different. Former Yugoslavia under Tito and Cuba under Castro were nothing alike. Their status -and the status of all such states- as socialist states is even debatable.

Can you even *define* socialism? I'll give you a hint: It has nothing at all to do with governments. You people seriously need to stop pretending to know something when you actually know dick-all. It's like those morons who go to those ""I fucking love science"" pages on facebook, repost science meemees, and assume that because they plaster their wall or whatever with Neil Tyson quotes that they're super duper learned in the sciences.

"It's not all sunshine and rainbows. I'm a Vancouverite who's also lived in Seattle and I'm moving back partly because of what the Chinese have done to Vancouver. 

In Vancouver it really feels like the sense of community in many neighbourhoods is transforming. When your neighbours either don't speak English or let the houses sit empty and build isolated regions of their own culture (i.e. Richmond), it feels alienating for everyone. If the Chinese embraced our culture and language at least halfway (and sure, many do), it would be a different story. I have firsthand dealt with landlords, neighbours, and friends' parents who don't even make an effort.

Don't get me wrong, I love the infusion of Chinese culture and food, but Vancouver is experiencing a serious identity crisis and this is a significant factor. People talk about the ""Seattle Freeze"" but it is nothing compared to trying to make friends in Vancouver.

"When Starbucks &amp; Howard Schultz gets brought up - there are always two misconceptions.

1) Starbucks is evil and kills local coffee businesses.... that's false. Before Starbucks, there was no such thing as a local coffee store - let alone a store selling coffee for $5 a cup. Starbucks was the first of its kind and paved the way for all the other local coffee stores and they have Starbucks to thank for that. You say Starbucks kills local businesses but how many other coffee stores do you know of in Seattle.... a lot. I know its easy for uninformed people to point a finger at a major multinational corporation but really, get your facts straight. 

2) Howard Schultz moved the Sonics to OKC..... false, I honestly put more blame on the Sonic fans and then the guy from OKC who bought the team. 

Let's have a look at average attendance compared to the whole league: See here: http://espn.go.com/nba/attendance/_/year/2007

* 2001: 17th out of 29 
* 2002: 21st out of 29 
* 2003: 20th out of 29 
* 2004: 23rd out of 29
* 2005: 21st out of 30
* 2006: 23rd out of 30
* 2007: 25th out of 30
* 2008: 28th out of 30 (Last year in Seattle)

So, as you can see, from a business perspective - the Sonics were doing pretty bad and their fans were not supporting them. In addition, they rejected a new arena being built. The Key Arena is a very old arena that doesn't meet with NBA standards.

"This happened last year to our condos. They did so much damage we had to replace the whole wall of mailboxes. Luckily we had money in the HOA fund and didn't need a special assessment. 

This year we've had people following package trucks and swooping up packages when the truck leaves the dead end road. I had something delivered at 1230, got home at 130 after lunch and it was already gone. Total loss 5 packages this season. Nothing major, just annoying. 

I saw a dicey vehicle (beatup red Mazda RX7, mid 80s 2nd gen with blown out exhaust) driving very close to a delivery vehicle around 1230 a couple days later so I followed it, he had parked backwards looking up the road and wasn't in a driveway or anything, just a gravel turn out. I drove by and he looked pretty shady in winter clothing like perhaps he might be getting in and out of his car often. We made eye contact as I drove by a little slow and I called 911 (non-emergency of course) to report a suspicious vehicle when I got back to my house. 

Right as a sheriff called me back to get a description of the car this guy comes tearing out of the road heading towards where the sheriff was coming from funny enough, not sure what happened but I put a decoy Amazon package on my porch in plain sight with an empty beer bottle and a male nude playing card in it sitting on my porch and no one has stolen it yet even while we were gone for the holiday weekend.

"There should be two tiers of these camps. 

The first tier should be for drug addicts who are for the moment beyond help. These camps should be a safe place to stay and offer drug treatment. But that's it. 

Tier two should be for people that can offer something to society. Charge them room and board. Four hours a day of chopping down blackberry bushes for three meals and a warm shack with a community bathroom. The other four they can take a class or learn a skill or get counseling.

The first tier provides something for those who are for the time being empty husks of human beings, with the only objective being getting them off drugs and giving them something to shoot for (i.e. tier two camp).

The second tier provides work, opportunity for fulfillment, and more of a community. 

Desperate times call for desperate measures. We had camps in the thirties, i.e. the federal camps in the Grapes of Wrath, and those were based on similar principles: work, community, self-sufficiency. People loved them.

Edit: I've seen a few people suggest solutions that involve a wide-array of separate services to tackle individual causes of homelessness. Things like job training, mental health resources, housing etc. The problem with that approach is 1. It's complicated. You're giving people who can't handle the demands of ordinary life *another* set of bureaucracy to navigate, with all the associated paperwork and logistics problems. 2. It's invisible. For both the community, and the homeless, the ROI will be low because humans are visual creatures and we won't be able to *see* anything being done. That's why some of the New Deal programs in the '30s were so great: they solved some unemployment problems are were both highly cohesive and visual, like the Civilian Conservation Corps. Which I really think should come back.  ",,,,foxtrotskyite,,,1480649277,t5_2qhad,t3_5g0cvk,t3_5g0cvk,43,1483407182,0,0,daols5p,Seattle,,,

"This video demonstrates an interesting rule I've been taught for avoiding collision in inland waters.  

If you look at the bit of the island in the background behind the *Nap Tyme*, you can see it stays behind the *Nap Tyme* with no lateral movement (i.e. it's the same piece of land staying behind the boat, rather than moving slowly left or right), even though both vessels are moving. That's a pretty solid sign that the person viewing is at or new a collision point. 

A person on the stern of the ferry would not quite see this effect, but something close to it, which is why you have to be careful about exercising this technique with large vessels, especially when you're not the large vessel.  And of course it requires fixed objects in the background.

"Maybe I'm just in a particularly crappy mood today (see my username), but your post kind of struck a chord in me.

I work in nonprofit advocacy. It's a hard field, and I've been doing it since around 2010. It kind of ""found me"" - I focused on a business related major and fell into via serendipity. A lot of things are like this. I find a lot, but not all, of my coworkers have a similar story. Usually they have an in-demand skillset that is useful to nonprofits because, hey, they need money too, and these same people are willing to sacrifice the benefits of private business for the mission of a nonprofit. 

That being said, you strike me as the typical r/seattle poster - either it's ""I just moved here blind, now I'm trouble because jobs/cost of living/government/commuting isn't the same as it was in my hometown of West Bumblefuck, please solve my problem for me."" OR ""I moved here to be the typical drone for Giant Tech Company A and I have no friends/employers/networking contacts, please introduce me to yours so I might behave like an ass around them and make you look like an ass by extension."" 

The fact is, networking is hard in Seattle, especially in fields that tend to be relationship based and not have a lot of money (nonprofits). You've just effectively asked someone to do that work for you - just because. For all I know, you're a total ass - and even asking this kind of screams ""I'm lazy!"" to boot.

Futhermore, I'll tell you right now up front that you are not your degree. I'd be more interested in what you're doing professionally to make you worthwhile to an organization - it doesn't necessarily need to be ""outreach"" it can be simple as ""accounting"" or ""business development"". The fact is, degrees are nice, but they are really bare minimum. No one really gives a fuck that you focused on X and are passionate about it - the question is really ""What can YOU bring to the table."" Not what the organization means to you.

Finally, the B+G Foundation is probably one of the hardest places to apply in regards to nonprofits. They're really visible (everyone knows about them) and they pay well (for a nonprofit). This means every Sally B.A. is applying for them. The fact however, is, unless you know Bill Gates personally, or happen to have ""Harvard College"" on that diploma of yours, its unlikely you'll be what they're looking for. As I was told when I graduated prior to the crash, ""It's not that they don't see your app, it's that you literally don't have what they want."" They typically take in people with 10+ years of experience in their fields for specific roles that are directly related to what they were doing - there are no ""generalists"" or ""social media managers"", but there are people who are scientists that deal with water quality because they did that same thing, for ten years, for Abbott Labs. It's not an ""opener role"". What you're doing right now is akin to getting your AA in Computer Studies, then getting confused when Google isn't responding to your applications. You've literally just got your foot in, now you want the plum position. Typical mistake (I did it too) but don't kid yourself.

HOWEVER, this isn't to say that you should just give up - but be aware that nonprofits are hard work, pay shit, and generally only give you the ""mission"" and ""working to better the planet"" as compensation for all that. It's government work without the stability or pension. Is that okay with you - ask yourself this long and hard. It might be okay now when Mom and Dad pay some of the bills, but Seattle is really expensive. Do you want to put yourself through that?

Second, focus on earning the cred that would make B+G actually want you. This means going out to events, networking, and probably taking a modest job at an org that is equally modest. You need to work your way up - and the reality is, no one is going to network for you. There ARE jobs out there, but YOU need to go find them. Try Linkedin to see where you should go, and ACTUALLY SHOW UP. You can't do this via the Internet.

I know my tongue lashing is a bit assholey, but you owe it to yourself to understand what you're up against. Focus less on what orgs can give you, and focus more on why orgs would WANT you. 

If that sounds too hard, or I hurt your feelings, sorry, but welcome to reality. Consider changing career paths.

Good luck!

"Most areas have their jerks, I don't think seattle has any more than any other region. In the Midwest you get ""Minnesota nice"", in the northeast you get self centered people, new York you get the overly aggressive people, in the south you get ""fake nice"" and in texas you get ""you'll never be as good as us"", California is full of self righteousness. 

I've lived all over the country, the only place I've been yelled at for holding the door open for someone was Mass., the only place an employee openly judged me for eating in my hotel room was Minneapolis, The only place I have had sports fans through old food at me for rooting for the away team was Madison WI. 

I think the Seattle Freeze has more to do with the people moving to seattle than people living in seattle (at least people that have lived here since the 80s/90s, the OGs if you will). A lot of the people that move here move here for the tech industry, and lets be real, a lot of those people don't have the best social skills. They just blame others for not being able to make friends. 

Seattle is different form a lot of other regions, we don't tend to bring food to new neighbors, we don't have huge block parties, we don't tend to invite people we don't know over to our houses. In a lot of regions those are ways to make friends, just not here. To make friends in seattle (pnw in general) you need to be pretty aggressive about it. 

I think the passive aggressive part comes from misunderstood humor. People from here are sarcastic as shit. It's not meant (most of the time) to be rude, but it can come off as passive aggressive if you don't expect it.",,,,SmilinGoat,,,1482380465,t5_2qhad,t3_5jkyks,t3_5jkyks,10,1483956238,0,0,dbhrtew,Seattle,,,

"""It's a rarity for someone to fall out of housing to homelessness without an underlying health issue that has not been addressed."" 

This is... not even remotely true. Like at all. Many homeless people are people who were living paycheck to paycheck and then had a financial downturn which resulted in the inability to make ends meet. Some are survivors of domestic abuse with no support system. Some have lost jobs unexpectedly and have yet to find a new one. The reality is, as much as 1/3 of the homeless population are children, who are not able to provide for themselves. 

OF COURSE there are homeless people who suffer with mental illness and health issues but to say they are the majority is patently false. Housing insecurity is a major cause of homelessness in our country, period. To say otherwise is frankly ignoring the structural causes of this problem and placing a lot of blame where it simply doesn't belong.

"I graduated from Code Fellows in May 2016.  I went through their 201 and 301 courses which focused on fundamentals, then took the 10 week Python 401 course.  Regarding the classes, the instructors were fantastic.  It was a ton of work but you learn a ton.

Now for the bad part, I am still looking for a job 7.5 months later.  I am not sure what is up with the career development/postgraduate side of things there, but shortly after the course finished, all the job leads they would send out dried up, which is a bummer.  Basically for the last 5 months I get an automated survey from them that asks what jobs I am applying for, if I have received an offer, and if I have any comments (which nobody reads because they never respond to the comments I leave).  Long story short, have a bunch of money saved up because the courses are expensive, and you'll need some living expenses while you look for work afterwards.

So thats my honest Code Fellows feedback.  Lots of hard work, great instructors, expensive, but really lacking in the ""help you find a job afterwards"" department.

"It's not Chinese people at large. 

It's the very wealthy mainlanders who are looking to get their money out of China asap. The typical family has an 'astronaut father' who works in a China and maybe visits Vancouver once or twice a year and is the breadwinner. 

They send their kids to UBC and they live in the multi million dollar home. Then the mom visits the student a couple times a year and still primarily lives in China. 

Few of them put down roots. 

It's made the cost of living in our city unbearable. Our politicians are spineless and fall to their knees for Chinese foreign investment. 

I love Chinese food and culture and by 2nd and 3rd generation they become quite westernized anyhow. 1st generation is usually a write off in terms of full social integration but that's like most groups. 

It's not being xenophobic because the reality the vast bulk of the crazy amounts of cash flooding our shores is Chinese. 

It's not sustainable and is causing a major upheaval all over Metro Vancouver.

Bullshit.  How do you think that theft ring gets 100 bikes to put in an apartment?  They buy them cheap off the bums who take the risk of actually stealing them.

The bike chop RVs that existed along Northlake Way have been pushed elsewhere due to the newly added restrictions on overnight parking.  However I have some plate numbers of the vehicles and names of the perps.  I gave all of this to the police and even showed a cop in person one of the RVs with a couple dozen bikes worth of parts.  

Despite the obvious theft ring and the fact that the area was littered with needles, none of the RVs had current tabs.  You'd think that would be enough to initiate enforcement of registration laws at a minimum (and possibly tow the vehicles), but Officer FatFuck had better things to do, such as demanding to know how I'd managed to afford the bike I was reporting stolen and in their possession.

"I was concerned to read this headline, but as usual it's editorializing by the Seattle Times. This actually seems to be a wonderful solution to a tough problem. It only removes one westbound lane for the 3-4 block section of Denny between Stewart and Minor.  The traffic issue on this section of Denny is people traveling *eastbound* toward the Yale onramp to southbound I-5.  With this change the righthand lane will be reserved completely for people headed to take a soft right onto Yale. As it exists this gets backed up for blocks already anyway in the afternoon and evening. The second lane will be reserved for buses, and the new third lane (at expense of a westbound lane) will be reserved for people heading straight up Denny over the viaduct to Capitol Hill.  There is rarely much of an issue with congestion on this stretch of Denny in the westbound lanes, so the cost is quite low for a tangible benefit.

"I'm not sure you know how Renewable Energy Credits work. When you produce renewable energy, you have the raw electrons and you also get a credit for those electrons produced that says they're green. You can sell them together, but in most projects, it would be impossible &amp;amp; impractical to send those exact electrons to a customer. Instead, the credits are sold to someone who wants green energy but can't produce it themselves, the electrons are sold like any other electrons.

For example, Imagine you run a power company in Illinois with a few natural gas plants, but your state requires you to get 20% of your power from renewables. You could build your own wind farm, but that's expensive, takes time and the wind in Illinois maybe isn't that strong or consistent. 

Instead I have a wind farm in Wyoming, and electricity here is super cheap because we have so many wind farms and not a lot of demand for electricity in general. Now you could build a transmission line directly from my wind farm to your part of the grid to get my cheap wind energy, but that would be ridiculously expensive. 

So we make a deal, I can sell you enough RECs equivalent to 20% of your power and boom! Now 20% of your power is renewable even though it still comes from your natural gas plants. I still have the electrons that I sell as normal into my grid, but am able to make enough money to keep operating despite low energy prices here. The theory is that my wind farm wouldn't exist if I wasn't able to sell these credits. By buying the credits you effectively get to say you made green energy happen that wouldn't have happened otherwise.

There's just not enough demand for energy and wind energy is more expensive to initially produce than natural gas energy. After 10-15 years though, my special credits expire and hopefully I made enough selling them to offset the more expensive initial investment.",,,,heimkev,Lower Queen Anne,,1483119036,t5_2qhad,t3_5l3iwk,t1_dbsrs06,31,1484154463,0,0,dbsuljy,Seattle,,,flair

"You are completely correct: Anyone with a interest in learning how something works can look it up online.

Unfortunately, not everyone takes the time to do that. They are content with listening to someone else tell them the ""facts"" (regardless of whether those facts are true, false, or misleading or not completely correct).

Our healthcare system, including Obamacare, is immensely complex. People were, and are, quick to decry Obamacare as a failure (and have been basically since day 1) without actually caring about *why* it failed. Their premiums aren't just randomly going up. They're going up because, among many reasons, some states decided not to expand Medicare. Which was supposed to offset rising costs for healthcare providers. Coincidentally, some of the [red-est states are the ones who have opted not to expand Medicaid](http://kff.org/health-reform/slide/current-status-of-the-medicaid-expansion-decision/).

A lot of companies also set their premiums way to low at the start. Because you have to make it enticing for people to sign up! Then they jack the prices up to try and recoup some of that lost money. That's not necessarily the fault of Obamacare (though you could probably argue it is).

Also, remember those people who, way back when Obamacare was first starting out, were cry out ""Keep our government out of my healthcare!"" yet were completely oblivious to the fact that Medicare *is* government healthcare. Those are the people who I'd claim are stupid. The ones who takes something at face value without trying to learn the facts themselves.",,,,notcaffeinefree,,,1480987392,t5_2qhad,t3_5go5mr,t1_dau4zca,10,1483506488,0,0,dau5oh4,Seattle,,,

"This entire article reads like a satire of incoherent, unthinking Queen Anne NIMBYs spouting hot air.

The ""anti gentrification"" suit is filed by the *Queen Anne Community Council* - one of the more wretched bands of scoundrel NIMBYs in the city. 

&gt; Reid and others who testified on behalf of the Queen Anne council said the legislation would result in developers buying modest houses, tearing them down and replacing them with three-dwelling complexes. 

This is literally already happening. 

&gt; They predicted that the redevelopment would displace minorities in Seattle.

This is literally already happening. Building more units won't make this ""worse."" And give me a break that Queen Anne Community Council gives two shits about ""displacing minorities."" 

&gt; Sou Souvanny, another consultant who testified on behalf of the Queen Anne council, said the ordinance would “accelerate gentrification, driving up home values and reducing the number of entry-level single-family residences available to immigrant populations.”

And increasing the number of entry-level multi-family condo units available to ""immigrant population.""

"the upwardly angled corridor structure is a materials conveyor belt--think of it like a stairway escalator for grains and other materials with the purpose of raising the materials from ground level to above ship level so the materials may then be gravity poured into the ship cargo holds; the conveyor, at the apex connects into the large upright rectangular structure, and this is the material pathway switching plant that determines the ship cargo loading destination of the materials. if the ship to be loaded is adjacent to the switch building the materials merely fall into and slide down into the cargo holds. If the destination ship is docked behind further down the pier then the switch control building routes the materials on the high horizontal conveyor belt to the pier location of the docked destination ship where the route of the materials then becomes a downward slide into the cargo hods.",,,,1rational_guy,,,1483167888,t5_2qhad,t3_5l7cjq,t1_dbtnepk,12,1484170863,0,0,dbtrv0n,Seattle,,,

"&gt; Do you understand anything about the DAPL erroneous protests? The pipeline isn't going through NA land.

No but it is within half a mile of the reservation which will be affected in the event of a spill or leakage. The pipeline also runs directly under their water source.

&gt;The pipeline is going ~100 feet under the Missouri River

The pipeline that I just linked was also an underground pipeline Just cause it's underground doesn't mean it would be contained. It'll just soak through the soil and end up who knows where. Especially if it manages to reach any wells or underground water sources.

&gt; whereas rail cars, which currently transport oil out of the Bakken, go over the river.

For the last time dude, no one is talking about rail cars. You are the only one bringing it up, at this point I presume, because its the only argument you can win against. The proposal is to reroute the pipeline away from the Reservation and it's water sources. If you continue to talk about how unsafe it is to transport via rail you aren't fighitng my argument, you are fighting an argument you yourself are creating just so you can convince yourself you are right.

"is that a principle, or just your advice? 

the bus system in seattle is clearly an unusable disaster, biking is fundamentally half baked even if it weren't freezing rain half the year.

seattle thinks it can be like new york, but new york is perfectly flat. it makes far more sense to be able to walk in new york, or even skateboard, what have you, but on top of that, new york has an excellent, *usable* subway system. in seattle, it's not at all uncommon to wait a half hour in the freezing rain to take a late bus to a place only 7 miles away, and to do so over the next *hour*. 

I go to school only 6 miles away, and the only reason I don't jog or bike there is that there is no legal way to be a pedestrian or take a bike on some of the roads along the way, not to mention the 300 foot height variance. therefore, it's either 30 minutes in traffic, or 1.5 hours on the bus.

"Well saying it's a good idea to do so is all a matter of perspective.

In situations like these, there are two different ways bystanders can react. There are those who sit back and watch, and those who react. I've always been the latter. If I can stop others from getting hurt, Ill do so. My screaming at them that I see them and their type of car could reasonably distract them from their adrenaline infused focus on firing that gun. I could care less about the people shooting at one another, but when you're firing 20+ shots out into the open, that's 20+ chances of someone waiting at the bus stop getting shot, a child coming out of the store with their mother, my girlfriend walking home etc.

"I would alter the question to:  ""Scott, there are smaller, obvious examples of concentrated property crimes associated with homeless camps.

I doubt that police don't see these with their own eyes while on patrol, or that they don't receive significant neighborhood complaints about them.  

My guess is that it's very difficult to prove in court that a particular defendant stole a particular item like a bicycle, just because he's found in possession of it.

"Well, I disagree. Electric scooters don't feel safe in the dark or the rain. And in order for them to be autonomous, you'd need to put serious gyroscopes in there (Lit Motors is theoretically coming out a self balancing one soon) which would make them much much more expensive.

The point is that at full capacity, a subway system can move a lot more people through than cars, even if the cars are carpooled. Subways are also grade separated and in tracks, so they don't have to stop for stoplights, which makes them much faster. (Cars require stop lights. Otherwise, they would not be able to go wherever they want.)

"Your not going to find anything in or near downtown for that price range including West Seattle. As others pointed out, go far north or south is your best bet. East side (east of Lake Washington, Bellevue, Redmond) is expensive too and you'll have the dreaded 520/I-90 commute. Find something close to the Link light rail or a Sounder train station and use an Orca card to commute into downtown. Rainer Valley is cheap for a reason, anything south of I-90 on the east side of I-5 from Columbia district to Renton, try to avoid. West of there is South Park, White Center, and Burien is a little better then Rainier Valley if you don't mind low flying commercial airliners over head.

My suggestion is to look at Renton, Kent, Aurburn, Burien, Des Moines, Federal Way, just about anything south of I-5 and 405 exchange you will find apartments or ""rooms for rent"" in your price range and they all have nearby Train stations. You drive or bus to the station, jump on the train and 20 minutes later your in downtown Settle.

This article is not scientific, it's conclusions do not control for external factors, and it's very light on facts. Is the minimum wage a good or bad thing for the local economy? It's far too early to draw any real conclusions. Years from now, once it has actually fully gone into effect, it will still be hard to tell. The minimum wage is only one of many competing economic factors. Given the current real estate market, tech boom, and the low percentage of Seattleites who make minimum wage, it's probably one of the less impactful ones. 

The only things that we can say for sure is that the wage:

* hasn't crippled the economy(it's still thriving)

"I was a mechanic in the Army.  After Desert Storm I helped recover over 200 heavy wheels that were left for dead in the middle of Kuwait.  I must have worked on 100's of trailers and trucks during those years.  If you were an operator in my unit your truck got inspected by a mechanic every day before you were allowed to drive it.

The Port of Seattle allows these trucks to go out on the roadway un-inspected, and allows them to destroy entire neighborhoods.  I work in Georgetown and I see these trucks being worked on all the time on the sides of the road.  They have trucks with bald/flat tires, missing lugs, cracked air hoses, bad brakes, etc.  Carrying thousands of pounds of stuff in metal boxes.  Right next to your car on the street.  The quality of the drivers is terrible.  A lot of them run in gangs around GT, blocking the side streets so they can all park in a group.  the sides of the roads are littered with stuff that has fallen off of these trucks and trailers. They either drive a 5 miles an hour being as safe as they can, or like they are back in their home country where there are no laws.  During the summer I watched the corner of 4th and Dawson and I saw no less than 6 port trucks run the red light.  There are a bunch of PoS police--have you ever seen one pulling over a truck?  I can count on one hand the amount of times I've seen something like that happen.

The PoS, and only the PoS will be the ones to fix it, and my guess is that nothing will happen until somebody is seriously injured by one of their contractors.  They block the roads into west seattle--that was one of my major points for leaving WS--and all of this is in the name of a shipping company getting an extra .001% in profits.  Nobody seems to care about what happens to the rest of the city as long as a few hundred connected people get their fat, taxpayer subsidized checks.

TL;DR Port of Seattle is terrible, risks your life, and makes you pay for it.",,,,wisepunk21,,,1482270115,t5_2qhad,t3_5jef1p,t3_5jef1p,12,1483921917,0,0,dbfubbd,Seattle,,,

"&gt;Christians are in power and want to control women's bodies

I'm pro-choice, and even I know that's a gross oversimplification. Come on man. Christians see unborn babies as people. They see killing that unborn baby as the killing of a person. Don't play it off like it's ""wanting to control women's bodies."" When you do, you're just engaging a lie by oversimplification.

&gt;believe women belong at home

Don't they? Don't they play a pretty major role in child-rearing? Or is it just more suitable to outsource child-rearing to lower class women while rich women get to maintain a career?

I'm not saying women can't go get jobs. But for crying out loud, in the past they **didn't have to** get jobs. That was a fucking luxury, so don't play it off like they were chained to the stove. They got to take care of things at home and their husband had the opportunity to make a living for the whole household. That was good.

Nobody stopped them from getting jobs. There were plenty of jobs for women. What really happened is that jobs started paying less and women were *forced* into the workforce, driving wages even lower by flooding the market with 100% more potential employees. Then we outsourced child-rearing to daycares, etc. Unless you're a woman who just LOOOVES her job, I'd say you got the raw end of the deal.

&gt;don't want gays to marry

Irrelevant. Gays don't even want to marry. At least, not monogamously.

"It looks like action.

This is argued to death here, but neither the homeless advocates nor the city are in the right on this.

I think most people would agree that establing a safe housing opportunity for the cities homeless would be a huge benefit... But we also need to be honest that many homeless are not going to adhere to the structure that such a housing solution would inevitably have.

We *must* be more proactive in finding solutions to the services-side problem of getting homeless people with mental illness/emotional imbalance/substance abuse issues to get involved in services. This. Is. Not. Easy.

But, city homeless advocates, if you want to pursuade the people in this city who think that the homeless are lesser citizens and the cause of crime and a blight on the city...You *MUST* show the voters how you are going to aid the homeless people in a more permanent and lasting way.


Also, city homeless advocates.... Stop conflating Seattle's housing crisis with the homeless crisis. Seattle has a huge problem with housing affordability with middle class and lower income residents...But that has almost no impact on fixing the problem of homelessness. It's a rarity for someone to fall out of housing to homelessness without an underlying health issue that has not been addressed.


TL;DR:. You tell the voters how you're going to fix the health problems of the homeless in a better way than the status quo, and the voters will help with a permanent housing solution.

"As an employer who has worked with several interns we've brought in through these programs, let me offer some suggestions:
  
* If you are lightly experienced, or inexperienced before enrolling in these programs (fresh out of college with a spiffy degree with no technical background i.e. Philosophy, etc.) you are facing a much steeper challenge than someone who has a comp-sci degree and attended one of these programs for ""finishing experience"" or whatever.

* We get a lot of applicants from these programs. I can almost tell you which ones will thrive and which will not from the resume they submit: The ones who do best and finish their internship and result in FTE offers have some kind of real-world functioning project (read: NOT merely time working at a company making small-time contributions to a larger project). Developer applicants who finished their instruction program and spent the last 6 mos. at a banking institution working on refreshing their .css or spiffying up an existing website - 9/10 of these resumes are worthless.  

* Compare that last bullet to a developer applicant who built something full-stack and it calls upon external API's and has some transactional processing capability to it, or maintains persistent statefullness to the application, etc. You know, something other than a Wordpress blog - THOSE applicants get noticed. And it does not take anything more than time and effort to produce something along those lines. All the whiners who gripe about how every job requires ""25 years of experience preferable, 10 - 15 years of experience minimum..."" or some other such insanity - ignore that shit. Show us what you have MADE. 

* Open source software is always in need of people to expand the functionality of their universe. READ code. Contribute code. Watch and learn as people who are more experienced and smarter than you destroy your sense of self worth via code reviews... then get up and finish the task adopting the principals they provided you as FREE education. THAT is how you get battle hardened as a developer and showing us your GIT commits will prove how you have learned to make less shitty code.
* Be open to criticism and be learning oriented. We've dumped two boot-camp types because they simply could not move off their perspective as to how something should be done, or could not be bothered to remember something we've given the feedback on 14 times previously.

"I agree.  I would add, I think a lot of the Seattle culture is focused on politeness.  We rarely honk our horns.  We don't jaywalk, even when there are no cars coming.  Etc...

So, when there is a true conflict or we have an issue with something, we don't want to overtly call it out and cause conflict with someone else.  But, we have to deal with it in some way, and the easiest way without directly tackling it is to be passive aggressive.  I know this is how I am - I've lived here my whole live (and I'm an *old* redditor...).  I catch myself more and more and try to make an effort to tackle it head on, but you have to be careful there because if the target of your conflict has also been a resident of the area for a long time, they may not deal with direct conflict well, and the whole ""direct approach"" can backfire, causing them to shut down.  This is very timely, as I'm experiencing this exact phenomenon right now!

"I am now 48. When I was young, my dad told me to work hard when young, do your best. Put in your time living as honest as you can, and it will pay off. In life, in everything. 

I worked crap minimum wage jobs for 2 years out of high school. It was never enough money to live on my own.  I joined the army, the infantry.  Then worked for 25 plus years, honest and hard.  After establishing a family, having 2 kids, bought a house or 3, and always signed up for insurance my employer offered. 

2009, things change. 2 kids in hospital, 3 times. Me once in the er with a cut, 6000 for 4 stitches. Kids hospital trips cost me 12000.  I owed 2700 for the 4 stitches. 

Now I'm in serious debt.  Why did I not go in debt prior to 2009?  We had Dr visits, a couple minor surgeries. Nothing more than post 2009?  Actually, a lot more. He'll both my kids were a 10$ copay.

Insurance did this.  Not my employer, not the prez, not the house and Senate. 

If it so easily happened to my STUPID ass, I'm sure it happened to millions of others. This is what we're pissed about. I stopped going to the Dr 3 years ago after getting a 400$ bill for blood work. And I'm not ever going again unless my life is in danger.

This is my insurance,  Obama care or not. It is broken, completely.  It costs my employer 1400, and I pay 490 of it a month.

"People are being mean. I'm sorry. I lived in Seattle for only a year for grad school, so I only have a taste for the city.  Please don't see this thread as a sign that everyone in Seattle sucks.

That said, like you inferred, a lot of Seattlites have seen their city and neighborhoods change a lot over the last 10 years or more, become a lot more ""hip"" and a lot more expensive. They attribute this to newcomers because, frankly, it's true. People move here for jobs which is understandable and you can hardly fault people for moving where the jobs are, but what a lot of people *hate* is a total ignorance of the context and history of the places they go. Neighborhoods like Ballard and Capitol Hill used to be filled with the working class/manufacturers/fisherman and gay/counterculture/artists respectively. They still have that vibe, but have been washed out by gentrification and expensive ""artisinal"" restaurants. 

Anyway, that all to say, Seattle is a great and beautiful city with a ton of stuff to do. If you move here and are outgoing enough to break through the ""seattle freeze"", AND have some self-awareness and place-awareness, and can keep up in a conversation about the changing city, people will respect you a lot more. But if you move here and get a fancy new apartment in cap hill and keep telling everyone you just moved here, you might get shut down pretty quickly.",,,,magyar_wannabe,,,1481043453,t5_2qhad,t3_5gr5e6,t1_dauihyv,10,1483521330,0,0,dav0409,Seattle,,,
