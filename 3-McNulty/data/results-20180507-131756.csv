"So, first off, I drive and bike for transportation in roughly equal measure, and I'm hugely in favor of more bike infrastructure.

I believe cyclists break ""the law"" at a similar rate to drivers, but I don't believe they break the *same* laws at the same rate as drivers. I see cars just baaarely run red lights all day (getting into the intersection right after it turns red), but it's extremely rare for a driver to run into the intersection on a red right before it turns green, or just blow through the middle of a red, and I see cyclists do this all the time.

Now, I think that's actually rational; cyclists are aware that they present much less of a threat to others than cars, so it's less of a big deal. Here's some actual data on that, showing very low rates of cyclists stopping for red lights in NYC: http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2013/11/bicyclists-red-lights-citi-bike-new-york.html

You can see the same thing with pedestrians. Pedestrians jaywalk *constantly* in the middle of a street, whereas you don't see drivers just decide ""gonna zoom across a bunch of lanes out of the blue now #YOLO"" nearly as often.

You also got to factor in the reality that at best only 30% of the population gives much of a damn about basketball. So to watch full grown adults, act this way over something that the rest of the population doesn't give two flying fucks about. Is well fucking weird.

"&gt;The yuppies of your parent's generation are the ones that paid for the light rail we have now.

I'm well aware of that.  And that they and my grandparents were completely derelict on this count and that is why we have a single light rail line at grade to the airport and RapidRide buses that come every 30 minutes during rush hour.  The third world does better than that you know

&gt;Taxes are a ""pay it forward"" kinda thing.

Not typically.  Most tax dollars go to fund services that have an immediate benefit to you.  Even with infrastructure we almost always tax people for projects that they will personally be able to use in the next few years.  ST3 is pretty oddball: we're taxing people today for projects that very possibly might last longer than them.

Other places would do ST3 differently.  You'd get the state legislature involved to create environmental review exemptions.  This saves you years in the planning process.  But that's difficult because in Washington the state legislature loves to fuck over Seattle.

Another thing other places would do differently is that they would bond the entire project out.  Even though the taxes haven't yet been collected to pay for it we can afford to start every project immediately.  The only remaining hurdle is finding people to do the actual work.  By doing it this way you can fund and finish the projects much more quickly.  And the people paying taxes to support their construction would actually get to use them.  It's purely a political choice on Olympia's part that we're not allowed to do this.  But it would make much more sense to get this done quickly and collect tax revenue from people who actually benefit fron the project.",,,,SubParMarioBro,Magnolia,,1462611281,t5_2qhad,t3_4i84jv,t1_d2w5s0v,13,1465693846,0,0,d2w6ruu,Seattle,13,,flair

"Rents and housing prices are, generally speaking, tied to income levels. Seattle has added a lot of higher income jobs well in excess of the current median income, and the lack of new building from 2008-2012 has basically created the lack of supply, because even in that time period, the region still grew. The market is trying to get through 5 years of no supply added on AND keep up with the legions of people moving here. Looking at income:rent ratios doesn't really reflect the lag in BLS type data when it comes to the vastly higher income levels being added here. Especially if you start looking at a distribution and not just the median number.

Building supply in excess of demand will work - it is going to take a long time before it manifests itself in lower prices. Rents tend to be sticky - it will take several years of having excess supply built before rents actually go down - you have 5 years of backlog to get through. And we all know it takes years to actually construct things. Developers will let units sit vacant for a long time before starting serious cuts on rents. First they will start with incentives, then rent decreases, and this plays out over years. Older units become comparatively worse the more new units come online so that effectively creates cheaper housing. 

Its not ""game over"" for affordability if you are talking a 10 year time horizon. If you are thinking about it as a macroeconomist or long term planner, there will be a recession which will reduce demand and supply will catch up and an equilibrium in the market will be reached. But if you are worrying about paying rent next month, or worrying about having to pay your bills in the next 1-2 years, or worrying about a rent increase next year...it IS game over. You will be priced out or kicked out before things on a macro level improve to the point where it impacts you on a micro level.

"All good suggestions...but if you walk by a [Made in Washington](https://www.madeinwashington.com/storeinfo.cfm) store, I would look there, too.

The liquor stores in Washington used to be state-run.  Their apparent mission was not to sell alcohol to adults with efficiency and good customer service--it was to do everything in their power to protect the good people of Washington from the evils of Demon Rum.      The state stores were all closed Sundays and holidays when I moved here in 1993.  When they were open, nearly all of them closed by 8 pm.  A couple of years later Liquor Control Board cautiously started opening a few on Sunday afternoons--they called it an ""experiment"" and acted as though it was a  risky, perilous thing to do.  They gradually loosened up and opened a few more on Sundays, and let a few stay open all the way to 9 pm (oooooooh!!)  But the state never seemed interested in running their stores like a normal business, paying attention to their customers and giving them what they wanted--that was just never their approach.  That only started to happen when we voted to privatize liquor sales in 2011.  They still don't allow little mom-and-pop markets to sell liquor--Costco, the biggest backer of the privatization initiative, made sure of that--so Washington still doesn't have many of those (in states where they can sell liquor there's one on every corner).  And the liquor stores still close too early.

"At a risk of getting involved in the drama, rule #6 needs to be relaxed to allow posts about commercial entities/enterprises and 'bulletin board' posts.

To handle the cruft of classifieds/job postings, a once-/twice-monthly thread linked from the header helps to keep things organized (/r/madisonwi does a fantastic job at this).

As an example, /r/dataisbeautiful has very particular rules.  It's very easy to moderate accepting/removing threads based on those rules, particularly in suggesting the recourse the OP should take to get their content up to par or resolving specific issues.

Honestly though, is 25 years really that long of a time line for a **54 billion dollar** infrastructure project? Is there any modern project that compares to this? 
The 2nd Ave subway in NY has been under construction since 2007 at a cost of $4.5 billion and that's for only 2 miles of subway.
The new Hudson River Rail Tunnel is expected to cost $20 billion and complete 13 years after unveiling.

Geometry? https://www.theurbanist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Street-Capacity-Graphic-768x252.png

&gt; If you truly want ""the market to decide,""

Letting the market decide would involve supporting each mode well to the extent that it makes sense for an area, and then letting people choose whichever one fits their life. If you look at money + resources (including space) that are given by the public for each mode, cars still dominate, even now.

&gt; then it does seem as though the Times represents a significant part of the market, its paid readership, who I would have to assume agrees with most of what they're saying.

Oh please, I know you pay close enough attention to the internet to know this is silly. The Times came out against Move Seattle, and yet it passed with a 16 point margin. The Times is markedly more conservative on transportation issues than Seattle residents, and you know it.

&gt; It's nobody's ""obvious reality"" but a handful of ""urbanist"" planners, and the developers that make money from this particular vision.

"Hi everyone,

I'm going to take a stab at addressing your concerns as a mod who works along side Careless. Sadly, due to my schedule today, I'm not going to be able to respond to most comments. I'll just be able to say a few things here and then wait until this weekend or Monday to address specific questions you might have.

The other thread was indeed deleted for linking to a different subreddit, though it's not because that subreddit is ""competing."" The other subreddit has consistently doxxed the mods and is the primary source of harassment we receive. Honestly, this was a disappointing decision that we had to make. I loved the discussion happening in the other thread and am sad that it is gone.

I'm a volunteer here. I like what I do, and I take pride in making /r/Seattle a great place. In order to be a mod of a large subreddit like Seattle, you have to be willing to put up with abuse. I have developed a thick skin doing this. But the people of this other subreddit have consistently crossed the line. I don't expect you to necessarily agree with this, but it is justified that mentioning that subreddit is forbidden here. I am able to focus my efforts on fighting spam and harassment if I'm not worried about being doxxed.

I also get that people do not agree in general with all of the decisions that we have made. People are unhappy we remove a post that they think should have been approved. People are unhappy when we don't remove a post that they think should have been removed. All I can say is that whatever your opinion of a particular post is, I guarantee you that there are a number of people who think the exact opposite of you. 

If the post is controversial in the slightest, then it is assured that we will hear from people who want it removed and people who accuse us of censorship if we do remove it. I promise that our removal decisions are based on our best attempts to apply the rules evenly without regard to our personal preferences. This includes removing ""Bernie"" posts even if we're a Bernie supporter or approving links to blogs we don't like or certain news sites that use a paywall. None of us get any form of kickback for anything we do here.

As to why we don't ""just let the voting system take care of everything,"" I try to whenever I can. I make an effort to only step in if it explicitly breaks the rules, and I like to think that I err on the side of leaving something up if I am unsure what to do. That said, the voting system is easy to game, and abuse or spam is a very fast way to get yourself banned. It is right that we do not let people vote on these things.

So that's all for now. My hope is that this thread can stay up so we can have the conversation that so many people want. Please keep it civil and we'll address what we can when we can.

"&gt;A light-rail drawbridge could be expected to open twice a day in winter and four times a day in summer, on average, said Karen Kitsis, project planning director. The North Seattle Industrial Association’s president, Eugene Wasserman, predicts as many as six daily openings.

&gt;Trains likely wouldn’t be interrupted from 7 to 9 a.m. or 4 to 6 p.m., when road drawbridges already stay lowered.

&gt;When they open, Seattle drawbridges require four minutes on average — brief enough for light-rail dispatchers, with trains arriving every six to 10 minutes, to perhaps coordinate passage with bridge tenders. Trains can resume service from nearby stations immediately, unlike car drivers who must wait for vehicles ahead.


I agree a tunnel would be better but a 70' drawbridge isn't nearly as awful as some the (unrelated) at-grade designs being considered.


&gt;a tunnel would flow gracefully into a potential Sound Transit 4 crosstown tunnel, from Ballard to the University District. This is because excavation would occur west of 15th Avenue, then curve so a Ballard Station would be oriented east-west.

Here are your options:

Option 1: Accept the new rental rate, and live there for the new lease term.

Option 2: Give notice that you're moving out at the end of the lease term.

Option 3: Say nothing, and then your landlord will give YOU notice that they're not renewing your lease, and will start showing the apartment to new prospective renters at the open house they picked (they're only require to give you 48 hours notice to show it during reasonable hours).

"All the post does is claim two things: (1) Supply and demand *does* apply to the housing market and (2) sufficient new supply could level out prices.

Point (1) is useful since there are apparently still people out there who don't understand, or simply don't believe though magical thinking, the theory of supply and demand. Point (2) is accurate, but it is also a political question whether we indeed want more supply, and if so how to get it, but that doesn't mean he's wrong that adding supply would help level prices.

It sounds like you don't want to build more housing. That's a legitimate position. But it is *not* legitimate to say that the reason you don't want more housing is that supply/demand doesn't apply to the housing market. This is the same crappy political tactic that leads people to deny climate change exists, rather than just explaining why they don't want to do anything about it.

"I feel I should explain.  I am watching this pig because if I don't she steals and eats art supplies which is problematic for multiple reasons.  The reasons are: 1) Many of the pigments are poisonous.  The pig is basically a tank and seems to be immune to anything she can fit in her mouth but no reason to take extra chances.  2) Art supplies are expensive and some colors are only available in large expensive sets.  Anyways, I'm watching the pig so my wife can take a shower.  After that she (my wife, not the pig) will be getting her hair done and doesn't want the pig to be alone for longer than needed.  So I am hanging out with the beast (the pig) until she (wife) is ready to go.  Also, the pig just tipped over a trash can.  You know how exciting a mystery box is?

There were two peeps helping you out when I got there.  I helped one of them unjam your bike from under the car and then insisted on staying until your friend came.  ""What if you have a concussion?"" ;-)

First thing I did once we settled down to wait was to check the squirrel sitch a few feet up.  There was the question of whether it was already dead before the crash.  It was laying upright, eyes open, wasn't at all squished, and looked like it might have just been stunned.  Poked it with the toe of my shoe and the whole thing moved like a cardboard cutout.

"I would be willing to bet there will be an unofficial Alaska Air presence regardless.  A bully out of town move like this won't go unnoticed.

If that doesn't scream desperate out of town pushy asshole I don't know what does.

Edit: And a day later, it looks like Delta's already having to walk back their original position.  I'm surprised those assholes ever thought they could bully a well liked local company like Alaska, who has had a legitimate presence at Pride for decades, but that's what being out of town assholes does, you think you can pull stunts like this and get by with it.

"&gt;Hating cars is popular.

This is way too much of an oversimplification, and not entirely relevant to this tunnel.

If a Sound Transit project went a couple years and a billion dollars over budget, do you think the stooges in Olympia and City Hall would still be standing behind it as a ""must be completed at all costs"" project? They do their best to limit Transit projects even when they are wildly successful.

A big part of the problem is that Olympia especially, and most of Washington voters East of the Cascades, treat transit advocacy as a zero-sum game that is tantamount to a war on cars. It's not.

"No, I am a person who has seen a woman almost die due to childbirth complications. You seem to be one of these people who thinks that childbirth *isn't* dangerous because of new-age natural-birth hippie bullshit that makes childbirth out to be a beautiful thing.

Yes, an ambulance is almost always a better solution than speeding through town. People don't always think clearly in an emergency and complications don't always come on in a way where someone knows ahead of time that something is wrong. Here's something you didn't think about because you were so intent on being a condescending jackass. Maybe it *wasn't* an emergency when someone got into a car and became one on the way and the driver didn't think to pull over to call and ambulance since they were already on the way?

You and /u/gjhgjh spouting your ""childbirth isn't an emergency"" horse shit as a blanket statement with condescending statements about people that have ""seen too many TV shows"" (seriously did you just copy/paste that from his comment? Can't come up with an original thought?) is ignorant of reality. The pregnancy mortality rate is nearly 19 per 100k in the US. That is over twice the mortality rate for car accidents in most places.

"Mailman here, I can concur, letter carriers can be stubborn and difficult to deal with, or, we can be super friendly and a pleasure to deal with. It really just depends. There are over 1,000 letter carriers in the Seattle area so there are bound to be some unpleasant people mixed in there.

I've been bit by a dog before. It sucked but I didn't have to miss work. Another carrier at my station was bit and was forced to take a few months off because of the severity of the bite. I love dogs but we still need to be careful around them.

Another note, Ballard is a massive station in Seattle and is kind of a mess. It's not surprising to hear this kind of thing happened there.

Edit: I'm actually working at the moment but when I get home this evening I'll post an update about how the ""hold mail because of dog"" works. (In case anybody is curious)

Edit 2: What should happen when there is a dog problem (meaning somebody was bit or felt threatened), is all the mail for that address would be temporarily held at the post office. If necessary the neighboring homes might also have their mail held. Then a manager or supervisor would go out and talk with the customer about relocating the mailbox. Once an agreement has been made and some documents signed mail service should resume. 

It's hard for me to understand how the mail could be held for so long. I assume the route did not have a regular letter carrier, meaning it was vacant. The guy in the video looks like a City Carrier Assistant (because he doesn't have the proper uniform), which is basically a new hire. If a route is vacant it can be terribly mismanaged because there is somebody different almost everyday delivering mail there. This was a problem that most likely never got addressed properly because different people, most likely newbies, were delivering mail there. Really strange situation, but I hope it's finally been resolved.",,,,Ironthumb,Lake City,,1462996646,t5_2qhad,t3_4iw5pc,t3_4iw5pc,24,1465789618,0,0,d31qu7x,Seattle,24,,flair

Crime in homeless camp sparks cleanup

By Jonathan Martin

Seattle Times staff reporter
Franz Dyduch considered the homeless camped in a greenbelt around his Beacon Hill house to be his neighbors. He fed their dogs and drank beer around their campfires.

In January, however, the relationship began to sour. His home was burglarized weekly. When his daughter admonished campers for victimizing an old man, she was pelted with rocks, and one morning she found human feces outside her dad's door.

Monika Dyduch attributes her 84-year-old father's fatal heart attack in April to the stress caused by ""the new breed"" of neighbors that have taken over ""The Jungle.""

""We've had homeless people who've been delightful neighbors for years, but they're different from the new breed, the trash that took over,"" she said.""",,,,altoidaltoid,,,1463527797,t5_2qhad,t3_4js2yg,t1_d39fjjp,20,1465923131,0,0,d39huuj,Seattle,20,,

We ran (for our lives) and put some good distance between us through the many trails into the jungle. We get in the car. Drive 40 feet and these dudes are STILL chasing us. They continued to chase the car despite driving away very quickly.

"If you go in during the AM peak, you can take advantage of Metro's numerous peak hour commuter routes between Bothell and Seattle. Here are some options: 

* From the Bothell Park and Ride (at 10303 Woodinville Dr), you can take peak hour only King County Metro route [312](http://kingcounty.gov/depts/transportation/metro/schedules-maps/312.aspx#weekday) or all day Sound Transit route [522](http://www.soundtransit.org/schedules/st-express-bus/522/weekday) direct to downtown. Both routes travel via Bothell Way and Lake City Way (SR 522) before getting on I-5 for the rest of the way down. Another option is to take Metro route [372](http://kingcounty.gov/depts/transportation/metro/schedules-maps/372.aspx) to the UW light rail station, then transfer to a downtown bound light rail train. 

* Another option would be to go to the Brickyard P&amp;R at 15530 Juanita-Woodinville Way NE and catch either a peak Metro route [257](http://kingcounty.gov/depts/transportation/metro/schedules-maps/257.aspx) or [311](http://kingcounty.gov/depts/transportation/metro/schedules-maps/311.aspx#route-map) to go downtown. Both buses get there via I-405 and SR-520. You can also catch the all-day [255](http://kingcounty.gov/depts/transportation/metro/schedules-maps/255.aspx) that gets you into the bus tunnel, but this is a slower ride as it threads its way through local arterials to get to Kirkland/Juanita before getting onto 520 to get downtown.

"I am very upset with the overall tone and attitude of the posters on this thread.

Every comment is completely polarized by their views, never taking into account the other side. PLEASE READ THIS WHOLE COMMENT BEFORE YOU VOTE.

Really, what should be posted is this: GIRLS, never respond to anonymous Craigslist ads looking for Porn Actresses. If you cannot accurately ascertain who is posting the ad, it is not safe. Want to do porn? There are plenty of reputable ways to get into it. It's a fucking multi-billion dollar industry, you don't have to visit creeps in their own house... ffs.

 BEYOND THAT, if you enter a STRANGER'S house, and imbibe in any sort of substance, that is a bad idea. This logic is not hard to figure out, nor is it far-fetched. It is common sense. Especially ,if you take into account the subject matter that you are meeting about. I mean.. come on. I fully and entirely expect my daughter to be smarter than that.

HOWEVER!!! IF SHE IS NOT SMARTER THAN THAT, I WILL STILL BE SO FUCKING ANGRY IF SOMEONE ABUSES HER!!!

It is NEVER right to abuse ANYONE. For ANY reason! My spouse has been molested and raped by multiple men, so don't you fucking try and tell me I'm ignorant, or uninformed about the situations that can happen. My Wife is a smart, amazing, and logical person. And yet, she found herself in situations that led to abuse. It happens QUICKLY. It is NOT something that is easy to resist, the guys who do this are usually practiced manipulators, and have done it before.

OVERALL I am trying to make the point that the EASIEST way to prevent rape and abuse is to educate Women on how to recognize bad situations, and how to get out of them. I honestly think that carrying mace or a handgun is the best way to prevent these situations, but if you are not comfortable with that, wouldn't a class on how to recognize predators be great??? 

Men are often times evil, and illogical when their dick is thinking for them (and even when it isn't). Instead of trying to reason with a Dick, why don't Women take their safety into their own hands, and protect themselves? Apart from Government (which is corrupt and unhelpful) aren't we all responsible for ourselves? The fact of the matter is, we all live in a world where evil and violence happens. I am a man, and I carry a gun because I know there are situations that may happen to me where a gun would be the only thing that could save me. If I was a Woman, I would have started carrying a gun much earlier. ALL I am saying is, if there is the potential for you to be in a bad situation (FOR EXAMPLE, VISITING AN APPARENT PORNOGRAPHER WHO IS A STRANGER TO YOU IN HIS OWN HOUSE!!!!) than take the necessary precautions to protect yourself.

IF YOU ONLY COUNT ON THE MORALITY OF OTHERS TO NOT GET HURT, THE FIRST TIME YOU RUN INTO A IMMORAL PERSON WHO WANTS TO HURT YOU, YOU ARE FUCKED.

TL;DR: WOMEN, YOU SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR OWN SAFETY BECAUSE YOU CANNOT COUNT ON MEN TO BE REASONABLE OR GOOD. THERE ARE EVIL PEOPLE OUT THERE, AND IF YOU ENCOUNTER ONE, ARE YOU GOING TO RELY ON SOCIAL STIGMAS TO SAVE YOU? PROTECT YOURSELF!

The report is bullshit and we all know it. Calling the tolling program a success because traffic is moving faster on 405 is negligent and obviously for a reason. We're not stupid and stop treating us like we are. Traffic is moving faster on 405 because more people are using side roads to avoid the cluster fuck that 405 could turn into if they all used it.

* The People (Friendly, Open Minded, Relaxed) the ""Seattle Freeze"" is overrated IMHO

* Opportunities for Physical Activity.  I do far more walking and biking here than anywhere else I lived.
* The Environmental Awareness and Friendliness.  It's not perfect, but better than most elsewhere
* The opportunities in my line of work (tech).  Not just the jobs, but the entrepreneurial attitude.

* Diversity.  We're not hung up on race/gender/orientation.  I once lived in the deep south briefly. 'nuff said.

Hates:

* The Traffic.   Too Easy to spend too much time going nowhere.  Mass Transit could be improved.
* The Cost of housing/Living.  Foreign Buyers are a real thing and distorting an already bad situation.

"No.  It's really good that Seattle is able to attack fires like this.  When I used to work in a pretty small town we'd quickly get two engines and six firefighters to a structure fire.  The next engine would be another 10 minutes.  Six guys gives you an incident commander, somebody to run the pump, and four guys to do things that actually put out the fire.  A structure fire is an environment where a lot of things have to happen at once.  With just six guys if we showed up and saw Little Johnny leaning out the upstairs window guess what's getting neglected while we rescue him.  Yeah, putting out the fire is going on the backburner.  Life is the priority.  When you can rapidly throw 5+ engines, a couple ladders, a medic unit, etc at the fire it means that you can do everything at once.  And because of this Seattle fire can use tactics that are a lot better than what my crew could pull off.

Another reason this is done is firefighter safety.  Firefighters are pretty good at getting themselves out of (and into) trouble.  So when something is bad enough that a firefighter gets in trouble, it's probably pretty bad.  And those rescues get really complicated.  Studies suggest it takes about 12 firefighters to rescue a single trapped firefighter.  That's three engines right there.  And ideally you don't want the fire attack to be dropped for the rescue.

Does that make a bit of sense?  If you send the resources you need to deal with a worst-case scenario you'll knock the fire down quicker.  If you send just what you typically really need then every time you see a bad situation it's going to end ugly.",,,,SubParMarioBro,Magnolia,,1462427251,t5_2qhad,t3_4hy7yg,t1_d2tf6lu,14,1465647490,0,0,d2thki1,Seattle,14,,flair

"I'm not sure if you realize this or not but you are making a very old argument. It's the same argument that Republicans make all the time against the welfare system. Basically fear-mongering that this type of person you have described is rampant in the system and that giving people 'too much assistance' will culminate into a culture of 'takers'. The problem is that this is not borne out by the statistics. 

The reality is that there will always be some waste in the system. There will always be people who find ways to take advantage of it. This is an acceptable loss as long as it's relatively small. The other reality is that we aren't talking about luxuries here, we are talking about basic human needs. Providing mental health services, job training, drug abuse rehabilitation, temporary and subsidized housing, etc. to these people isn't creating a taker culture. It isn't enabling them. It's giving them a chance to turn their lives around, and ultimately it's saving the society money and reducing crime in the long run. 

Almost nobody wakes up in the morning and decides to be homeless or on welfare because they are lazy. Being on welfare fucking sucks. Most people would rather support themselves. I don't excuse the incredibly small minority who refuse to do anything to help themselves, I just realize that from a policy standpoint they are not the reason for the problem and can mostly be weeded out by implementing safeguards in the process. At no point in our history has welfare been anywhere close to being a huge giveaway to lazy people. That is propaganda by the rich who don't want to contribute to fixing problems in society that they in part helped to create. 

If you really want to talk about waste in government, look at the defense budget. It is the biggest federal welfare program in existence behind social security and medicare/medicaid. But it's giving money to corporations (defense contractors and their stockholders) and people with real political power (their upper and middle class employees), which is why it is so difficult to make more efficient.

"Yeah, flashing lights actually endanger the cyclists around you as well as yourself. The flashing light makes it very difficult for others to judge your distance and speed even though they note your presence. At night the flashing light causes retinas that would otherwise be wide open to slam shut, temporarily causing other road users' vision to be compromised.

Another interesting observation: When riding with a flashing light you will notice that every reflective surface is bouncing back the flashing light you are emitting. In an urban environment the abundance of reflective signs and objects become a wash of flashing dots. The drivers moving in the same direction will be distracted as their eyes are focusing on all the flashing objects in their view and may completely miss other cyclists in this spread of strobes.

"If the $450M was somehow found, rather than a tunnel, my vote would be to extend Link north to Crown Hill with stations at ~68th and 85th with better east-west bus service. This expands potential network connections by creating a grid, helps solve the north/south capacity issue, and takes some strain off east/west arterials with improved transit service.

"The correct response to rent being too high: Build more homes &amp; apartments.


A more common response: require developers to build low income housing!

Developer response: Yea, fuck this. I'll develop somewhere else

Result: Demand is still increasing, supply stays the same. Problem gets worse.


Another common response: Limit the amount rents can be increased every year!

Result: Rents lag behind the market rates the longer a tenant stays in a unit. Tenants refuse to ever move because it would mean a giant rent increase (see Berkeley, San Francisco or New York). Owners are stuck with houses full of low rent tenants. Development grinds to a halt because there's protection from booting out tenants, so you can't build higher density properties. Owners refuse to fix anything because ""Why the hell would I fix anything if the tenant is still going to pay the same rent and they won't move?"".


TLDR: Rent control is a failed experiment. The correct solution to not enough housing is to increasing the amount of housing. Make it more attractive for developers to build higher density buildings.

"My Leroy's story I re-post every time I see a Leroy's reference or a suit buying question:
Long story.

Way back in high school in the mid 1980's someone told me an urban legend about Roger Mosley (aka TC on Magnum PI &amp; had a bit part in McQ). The legend was that he was on the gameshow $25,000 pyramid. He and his partner got to the last stage where he would give clues and the partner/contestant would answer ""Things that are ____.""
If the partner could guess enough right answers she would win the $25,000 prize. 

Things are going swimmingly until they got to a clue and the conversation went like this:

Roger Mosley (calm): ""Purple Suit""

Contestant: ""Things that are odd?""

Roger Mosley (patient):""Purple Suit.""

Contestant: ""Things that are colorful.""

Roger Mosley (less patient): ""Purple Suit!, Purple Suit!""

Contestant: ""I don't know. Ummm... Things that men wear?""

Time is now almost out.

Roger Mosley (exasperated and almost yelling): ""Purple Suit!, Purple Suit! PURPLE SUIT!!""

Contestant: ""I don't know, I don't know. Things that are bright?""

Buzzer sounds. The contestant doesn't win. The host comes over and decides to give the contestant a couple of clues just to see if the contestant could get the answer even though the money was lost.

Host: ""A new car. A new house. A fur coat.""

Contestant: ""Things that are nice?""

Host: ""Correct.""

The host looks oddly at Roger and says: ""Purple suit?""

Roger Mosley: ""Where I come from there is nothing nicer than a purple suit.""

Fast forward about ten years. The place that I work had a very successful year. Big year end party and it is made clear to me that I have to do ""something very nice for the occasion.""

So I spend about a week trying to figure out what to do. And then into my head the answer pops: ""Well there is nothing nicer than a purple suit.""

So off I go to find a purple suit in Seattle. I try Nordstrom, The Bon, The Men's Wearhouse. Not only does no one have a purple suit, but they all look at my like I'm an idiot for asking.

A couple nights after giving up my search and knowing that all is lost, I am rolling into the BP Gas Station right next to the Space Needle at 4AM after a Saturday night of having fun. While I am gassing up my car a guy rolls up in a big Caddy. He is wearing a gray shiny shark skin suit and has three of his ""ladies"" in the car with him. He is obviously a player.

Me (Excitedly yelling like a dork at 4 in the morning): ""Oh man I love that suit!""

Player (Jazz cool): ""Thanks man.""

Me: ""You wouldn't happen to know where I could get a purple suit? I've been looking all over the city and all the shops just laugh at me when I ask them.""

Player (Still Jazz Cool): ""Oh yeah man. Go over to Lee-Roy Menswear over on Pike and 2nd.""

Me: (Way too excited by the good news): ""Oh hey thanks man. I really appreciate it.""
That next Monday I go down to Leroy's (La-Roy's) Menswear. I walk in and look at the guy behind the counter and say:

Me (very cautiously): ""Would you happen to have a purple suit?""

Leroy (looking at me like it is a silly question. The exact same look as the other stores): ""Well of course. We have several. And you have a body like a black guy. They will fit you great.""

I then tell the story of the guy in the Caddy and the shiny sharkskin suit.

Leroy says: ""Oh yeah that is Willy T. Good customer. Big player.""

The other thing I remember when trying on my grimace colored Nehru cut purple suit, was when I asked if should have purple shoes.

Leroy: ""No way. That would make you look gaudy.""

The suit was a huge hit. I was walking down the street in it and a lady slammed on her brakes, rolled down her window and yelled: ""Damn white boy! You look great!"" Without another word she drove off.

I went back and bought another one two years later. I'm still looking for that elusive shark skin dark purple suit.

My friends would invite me to their weddings with the stipulation that I could only show up if I wore one of my purple suits.

tl;dr. There is nothing nicer than a purple suit. Shop at Leroy's Menswear. It is awesome!",,,,purplesuit,,,1463948913,t5_2qhad,t3_4kjiee,t3_4kjiee,22,1466027624,0,0,d3fjnhd,Seattle,22,,

"The two issues identified in the article would not in any way be solved by opening Paine Field to commercial service. TSA lines are not a SEATAC problem, they are a national problem resulting from a work slowdown due to political infighting because the TSA believes themselves to be understaffed. 

The international arrivals hall is a problem with capacity that won't be fixed until the airport builds a new facility or expands the old one. No airline would opt to fly internationally to PAE instead of SEA because there would be no flights to connect to up there, so that issue is totally irrelevant to the PAE conversation.

That said I don't see an issue with opening PAE to service, but it will never be a big reliever airport in he way MDW is to ORD.

Like an idiot, who is totally unfamiliar with Uber, she was like oh yeah sure! He kept pestering her for her phone number and was making pretty suggestive advances, eventually telling her that she needed to get in the front seat to pay for her ride.

"&gt; As for the record low runs, they were record high last year. Due to the cyclical nature of salmon spawning, I don't think we can count one bad year as doom and gloom. Overall we've been seeing amazing restoration success almost entirely due to careful and well executed fisheries management by WDFW.


I'm curious as to what information you're basing the last statement on? Because, while the projections were at record levels, the salmon never showed up. By all counts - the salmon season last year was a drastic implosion. 

Secondly, practically every anadromous fish population in the entire state is falling year over year - especially when considering wild fish as a baseline for a healthy naturally reproducing environment. 

I don't have a problem with the tribes being first in line. I DO have a problem with their use of gillnets. Gill nets are indiscriminate killers. Meaning, every single fish - whether hatcher OR wild - is going to be killed in the net. Considering the tribes are fishing over an ESA listed species, and will certainly kill whatever ESA chinook happen to make their way up the river when the nets are in - I find this to be hypocritical, short sighted, and ecologically irresponsible.

"**Full Email Transcript:**




Dear Members of the Seattle University Community,
 
I am writing to you in order to communicate some essential principles I hope we, as a university community can embrace, as we work to address the present situation involving the occupation of the office of Matteo Ricci College by the MRC Student Coalition and the events, communications and other matters associated with it. I also want to express my full support for all Matteo Ricci students, faculty and staff and the vital role they play within the university. 
 
The most important principle is that we act as a university community, the kind of community we proclaim and aspire to be, and that we do so within our values including, most importantly, respect, dialogue and care for one another. These are our issues, especially how we relate with one another and work to bring forth a culture and climate of inclusive excellence. It is our responsibility to engage with one another and, as a Jesuit institution, always do so by putting the best interpretation possible on the views of others. By listening and understanding we will respect all individuals within our community. While outside entities have and will seek to influence matters, it is upon each of us to recognize this is our issue and our responsibility to address. The best way to do so is in dialogue with one another and through established university policies, procedures and processes.
 
In a letter addressed to me as president and distributed widely to the university I found certain language, especially the words “our racist dean,” when referring to Dean Jodi Kelly, runs counter to our values of respect and dialogue and to the Code of Student Conduct. I ask that we avoid treating anyone in our community this way. I have made it clear that the university will not accept the demand for the resignation of an academic leader. We have shared the proper established channels for bringing complaints and other concerns forward so that they can be addressed in a way that respects the rights of all. The policies and procedures we have in place are the best way to address complaints and grievances. I have also made clear that the university, in keeping with our policies, does not intend to publicly respond to personnel matters.
 
The students have brought forth other significant concerns relating to curriculum, climate and cultural competency within Matteo Ricci College. We have outlined specific measures we will take to address these with the professional insights of external consultants and the active involvement and participation of concerned individuals. These are the essential principles for the best way forward.
 
As president of Seattle University, I sincerely apologize on my behalf and on behalf of the university for what has been the experience of some of our students when it comes to race, class, gender and disability in aspects of the university’s academic and social life. I hope my apology is embraced and accepted as intended. We have taken a number of steps to address these concerns, from forming the Task Force on Diversity and Inclusive Excellence to conducting a climate survey. We know there is more work to do and are moving forward deliberately on the recommendations of the task force in order to realize our ideals and aspirations.
 
We can and we will do better. You have my commitment that we will advance assertively and with urgency. The Task Force on Diversity and Inclusive Excellence will help guide us as will the expressed experience of students that we have come to more fully understand.
 
Finally, I want to honor all of the students and their families as we approach the time of year to celebrate and take pride in their accomplishments. We owe it to all of our students and their loved ones to mark what they have accomplished in a joyful and grateful way. As we engage in the important matters that have been brought forward in our community, we at the same time need to recognize and respect all of its members.
 
Please know my gratitude and blessings extend to each of you. As president, I remain deeply committed to making sure everyone feels fully welcome and part of our community.
 
Sincerely,
 
Stephen V. Sundborg, S.J.
President

Taking a fishing class at UW right now (sitting in class before my midterm tbh) but gilnets should be outlawed. They kill indescrimately and are found to kill not just fish but significant amounts of mammals such as otters and porpoises. 20-30 gilnets are lost per year by the tribes and other fishermen and become rouge. These nets will then float around the Sound killing almost anything that comes in contact with it.

"&gt; Don't be afraid to take the lane, it's often safer than riding to the right and inviting cars to pass you, especially on narrow streets or faster downhills.

I disagree with this one. Cars that care about bikes will always try to pass with lots of room. Cars that don't care about bikes will try to pass you regardless. Riding farther from the side of the road will only make it more dangerous for you with the 2nd category. 

The safest way to ride is to stay out of car traffic's way. Most cyclists just don't care enough about safety to give up the gains in speed. ",,,,bb999,,,1464053534,t5_2qhad,t3_4kp6s5,t1_d3gn3gu,-14,1466055684,0,0,d3h652n,Seattle,-14,,

"How is this ""progress"" when low income minorities are getting shoved out and see no such ""progress""? This is only ""progress"" for people who can afford $1 million condos. 

That is quite literally not the definition of ""progressive."" 

&gt; Seattle prides itself (and rightfully so) on its progressive nature

Not rightfully so - Seattle has the most regressive, anti-poor tax scheme in the nation. 

&gt; repeatedly voting more and higher taxes and fees to pay for the things 

WA and Seattle have budget shortfalls and can barely fund their schools. 

Seattle has one of the [lowest average tax burdens](http://www.thestand.org/2015/02/washingtons-tax-system-unfair-and-outdated/) of any major city in the nation, and the [*most regressive*](http://www.seattletimes.com/business/economy/washington-suffers-most-regressive-tax-system-in-u-s/) tax system. 

Our over-reliance on regressive sales taxes has been shown to lead to [declining state tax revenue growth](http://www.king5.com/story/news/local/2014/09/15/washington-sales-tax-wealth-gap/15658825/) and increasing income [inequality](http://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2024548711_taxreportxml.html), with an unequal distribution of funding for public goods like public schools and services. 

In addition, Washington is one of only [two states](http://www.washington.edu/news/2014/09/18/poverty-income-inequality-increase-in-washington-state/) that saw increases in BOTH poverty and inequality last year, and structural factors like poor funding of public goods (such as schools) is part of the story. 

Your race-blind claim is also false. 

Seattle has some of the worst racial inequality in the nation. It's black population worse off than black populations in other major cities.

Seattle's [black population](http://blogs.seattletimes.com/fyi-guy/2014/11/12/as-seattle-gets-richer-the-citys-black-households-get-poorer/) is the **9th poorest black population** out of any major city. 

&gt; lack household wealth in Seattle has in fact been spiraling downward for years. Remarkably, the earnings were higher in 2000 than they are today, before adjusting for inflation: The 2000 household median was $32,000, equal to $44,800 in 2013 dollars.

&gt; Also, the rate of homeownership has dropped by nearly half since 2000. Today, just one out of five black households in Seattle own its home. 

Seattle's black population is disproportionately poor and disenfranchised, and is on the receiving end of a disproportionate amount of racially concentrated displacement.",,,,lil_vega,,,1464292246,t5_2qhad,t3_4l6tej,t1_d3ks4r5,16,1466119362,0,0,d3kuyzt,Seattle,16,,

"Guessing nobody today will much give a fuck.

~~22~~ 18 years ago when Real World was here, it was a regular game to chase after the cast to heckle their presence, there were people that showed up every day at ~~Pier 66~~ Pier 70, and the cast got regularly thrown out of or refused service at local bars or counters. (The few bars that did allow them stuck them in empty rooms or only allowed them in before opening - you see that in the production shots, the bars are always empty except for cast.  Popular!)  

Things were so unwelcome that the show pulled the plug on Seattle half way through the season, and sent them to Nepal instead.  The Stranger I Saw U was full of references to rumors and various people chirping in how they'd fucked with the cast, flipped them off, mocked them, refused them service in a restaurant or bar, etc.  Great fun had by all.  We cooler-than-you cool kids (did I mention how cool we all were?) had in no uncertain terms rolled out a Seattle Freeze welcome to those shitty MTV fucks who were not welcome in our Cool Kids Neighborhood (did I mention how unwelcome they were)?

"Sigh. Graffiti is a loaded word and mysterious topic that the public often see's but greatly misunderstands. 

While everyone is entitled to their opinions, if you haven't truly been on the inside of this subculture, your opinion is probably based on a lack of knowledge.

Let me make a few things clear. True graff artists (the ones who are the most respected in the community, have a respect for the art, or strive to be either of those things) live by a very strict set of actual rules. These rules are passed down by the most respected artists and crews to the next generations of aspiring artists and so forth. 

In this community, there are three types of people essentially. True graff artists, toys (a derogatory term to describe bad artists/people who don't follow the rules/people who don't understand the rules/new people), and the general public. Graffiti is like a big club that you (the general public) and the toys aren't invited to. Additionally, your opinion doesn't matter (good or bad) and how you feel about the art also doesn't matter (good or bad). To put this philosophy bluntly, ""fuck everyone, you don't understand graff and it's not my job to explain it to you"" is a general philosophy many subscribe to. Not everyone, mind you, (some people adopt a ""I want the world to be more beautiful for everyone to enjoy"" philosophy) but quite frankly the best artists are cocky and don't care what the general public, toys, or some other crews think or feel. They've put in their work, they developed their skill over many many many hours of practice, they've built notoriety in the community, and they've somehow done this by remaining alive and out of jail. Cockiness is justified.

All of that said, one of the rules universally preached in the community strickly forbids writing on nature, places of worship, or personal property. Those who violate the rules are ostracized in the community, labeled as a toy, and shut out. Die slow.

Either they didn't have any handlers bringing them in to explain the rules, they didn't care, they didn't know, or their handlers are toys too. It doesn't matter what the excuse is, ""fuck em"" will be echoed in the circles that matter. Nonetheless, they won't get any respect in the community and get an automatic toy label.

And one last tidbit you let you in on to help set the record straight a bit because it's a pet peeve to hear this repeated by people who really don't know shit:

There's no distinction between ""taggers"" and ""graffiti artists"". At some point, some members of the general public cooked up some idea that they had it all figured out and put these labels on people and defined them separately. This is not correct. Graff artists *are* 'taggers', although some graff artists like this term and some resent it (because of the negative connotation invented by loud people who don't know shit). 

Nowadaze, most writers prefer and use the term *writer*, and while the term ""tagger"" is definitively accurate, the term is kind of looked down upon in the community as it has been overused and misused by the public for so long now. When the public scoffs and demonizes ""taggers"" they actually mean to say *toys*. But they don't know shit, so naturally they use the wrong terms.

By definition, graff artists/writers *are* taggers and these terms aren't defined differently in the graff community. If you want an accurate distinction of terms, you can say there is a difference between true *writers* and *toys*. Toys being kiddies like this guy who used some wack ass handstyle on a fucking tree.

#TLDR: Unless you're actually in the graff community, you don't actually know anything about it. You can read my post and get your daily dose of knowledge about a rabbit hole that's deeper than you could imagine. It's painful to see so much lack of knowledge on the subject, being spit out as facts by people who've never *touched*  a blackbook in their life. There's many rules to the game, and it's a violation to hit nature, among certain other things. I'll give you an inside scoop to a club you're not invited to.

"Seattle's white population as of 2016 was disproportionately attracted here by the tech and aerospace sectors, which means it is going to be more educated per capita than whites in cities like Philly.  So, the gap is going to be larger on that basis alone.  You'd have to compare white performance in each city first in order to compare things like that.  Also, whites are a vanishingly-small minority in many urban school systems like Chicago Public Schools.  Most have gone private or suburban by now; Seattle's public system retains more white students than those places.  

But ultimately, I'm not sure why this is seen as something that even CAN be ""solved"" by outsiders.

I try and use my passenger's name first (""Is there a Hortense in there somewhere?"" and the like) to establish the connection because it's 100% convincing/reassuring if I know their name first. If a passenger leaned in my window and asked ""Are you /u/GEN_CORNPONE?"" I could be anyone and still say ""Yes!""

So first try and establish identity. 99.99% of the time this'll cover it and you'll be good all the way home. If for some reason you're still not satisfied you can ask for the driver's Uber-issued ID card (no picture...useful only for claiming discounts...I don't carry mine FWIW) or ask him/her to show you the app with your name on it. At this point I'd probably think you were a little nuts, but then I'm not an axe-murdering Uber impersonator.

Ed: Calling your driver via the in-app PBX is another good method. If no phone rings in the guy's car or someone other than the guy in front of you answers the phone you have cause for concern.

Your ultimate protection if you feel hinky about your driver is to cancel the ping in your app, wait a couple of minutes, and ping again hoping to get a different driver. If you think your experience warrants some sort of official attention make a note of the suspected impersonator's license plate state &amp; number, the make/color/model of the vehicle, and a description of the driver. Report these details to Uber Support and/or SPD as your conscience dictates.",,,,GEN_CORNPONE,Lower Queen Anne,,1463339698,t5_2qhad,t3_4jfasr,t3_4jfasr,17,1465873087,0,0,d36ltzt,Seattle,17,,flair

"Hi. I'm a former UPS driver, and I just want to spread some knowledge in hopes that the more people that are aware, the less likely unwarranted accusations are thrown around in future situations similar to this one.

That being said, I'm not defending or attacking either party in this situation, just trying to add some insight.

UPS drivers are rated on a variety of stats that are tracked by computers in the vehicle in order to promote safety (backing after delivery, open bulkhead door while driving, seat belt on while engine is on, etc.). 

With that in mind, if I were in the same situation, I would have done the same thing to avoid unnecessary backing. While I was there we had a newer driver explain a situation he got into where he actually had an on-car supervisor with him while he was out on route and he pulled into a cul de sac where a party was going on (so there were a lot of cars making it hard to turn around). The on-car supervisor got out and helped him turn the thing around, and the driver asked what he should have done if he had been alone. We were recommended to go knock on doors and ask people to move their cars before attempting any backing. If that didn't work, we were told to call in to the distribution hub and someone would drive out to us (usually a 30+ minute drive for a company that basically counts time as money) and help us back it up.

UPS is very serious about avoiding backing.

That being said, they're really just protecting the drivers, because they know that once you hit something there's no going back, but if you call you did everything you could to avoid it. Helps with legal ramifications and helps you keep your job.

Also, I'm not insinuating that the posted situation is the same, I'm just trying to add some perspective on a situation that this reminded me of.",,,,Soundproof81,Bothell,,1462942653,t5_2qhad,t3_4isary,t3_4isary,59,1465776007,0,0,d30yesf,Seattle,59,,flair

"That's expensive, and quite frankly I'd rather tax dollars go to programs that actually try to get people out of the Jungle rather than creating a perpetual liability for the city to maintain.  You could figure at least two cop-years would have to be assigned to this; with benefits that's probably $250k a year.  Sanitation workers that can deal with hazardous materials, probably another $250k.  Add in additional city bureaucracy and conservatively I'd estimate it'd be a million dollar per year.  Total waste of money; it just lets people shit in slightly cleaner conditions than they did before.  It doesn't get them into a place with a real roof over their head.

It also sends the wrong message.  It says that we accept our failure as a community to deal with the homeless problem in any meaningful way.  We shouldn't expend money to let people subsist as addicts living under the freeway.  We should do everything we can to get them out, get help, get back on their feet, and rejoin the rest of society.  Those that don't want to come out, that's their prerogative, but I don't want any money going to those who would stay under a bridge.  Displacing them just moves the problem elsewhere.  Removing them forcibly so they don't disperse requires incarceration or committing them, and that's a waste, too.  We cannot subsidize people living like animals under the freeway.

"For almost 50 years now, Seattleites like have [voted down](http://seattlish.com/post/83663717975/on-blast-90-years-of-fucked-up-seattle-public) any efforts to make modern, functional, forwarding thinking programs to create transit and better transit infrastructure. 

* In 1968, voters approved the Kingdome, but rejected transit  

* In [1970](http://www.seattletimes.com/business/economy/the-mass-transit-system-seattle-might-have-had-jon-talton/), voters rejected four transit-related bonds, causing the federal government to reroute transit aid to Atlanta instead of here.  

* In [1972](http://metro.kingcounty.gov/am/history/history-1970.html) voters allow a small transit tax for busses, but reject the tax for electric rail. (Even the meager vote for busses was the first time Seattleites approved new taxes for transit since 1918)  

* In [1995](http://metro.kingcounty.gov/am/history/history-1990.html), voters reject a Regional Transit Authority (later Sound Transit) measure for a gigantic, $6.7 billion transportation system over three counties that would’ve featured commuter rail, light rail, express buses, and expanded HOV lanes 

* In 1999, with Initiative 695, local voters show their love of Tim Eyman and regressivism- scrapping the progressive car excise fee for a super-regressive $30 state car tabs. Since 29% of the vehicle excise tax went to local transit, local communities have been scrambling to keep their buses running ever since. 

* In 2002, voters showed their hatred of forward-thinking transit/infrastructure funding and support an Eyman initiative yet again: voters approved I-776,which restricted local governments from adding their own excise taxes and limited local license tab fees. While the measure was shot down at first for being unconstitutional, it was upheld by the State Supreme Court in October 2003. 776 repealed many taxes that the public had [already voted on](https://researchcouncil.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/initiative776.pdf)  

* In [2005](http://www.seattlepi.com/local/transportation/article/Monorail-will-go-to-voters-for-5th-time-1183631.php), Mayor Nickels gets the ""all-or-nothing"" plan for a West Seattle-Ballard monorail on the ballot. The plan is a watered down, poor version of the original, so it failed. Its rejection gutted Seattle Monorail Partners, which had been working to upgrade our transit system since they were created by a public vote in 1997. Council President Jan Drago (accurately) expressed fear that not building the monorail segment means ""we will pass it to future generations."" **Now look where we are!** 

* In [2011](http://seattlest.com/2011/07/13/last_night_people_are_voting_with_t.php): The Congestion Reduction Fee. When our regressive and outdated sales tax revenue plummets during the recession – the King County Council approves a $20 fee on vehicle tabs to make up the $60 million deficit, collected in 2012  through 2014  

* In [2014](http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/with-transit-money-approved-seattle-pledges-to-spend-new-dollars-well/), Seattleites vote *FOR* maintaining some bus transit, with more regressive taxes - a $60 car-tab fee and a 0.1 percent sales-tax increase - to keep many bus lines from being cut and to expand services on a couple bus lines. 


Just think where we could be now if voters hadn't rejected mass transit on multiple occasions and hadn't supported regressive taxation and Tim Eyman's anti-transit, anti-infrastructure initiatives. ",,,,lil_vega,,,1462919879,t5_2qhad,t3_4irb4e,t1_d30h5yp,11,1465769300,0,0,d30kbnf,Seattle,11,,

Oh boo hoo.  There are plenty of things I don't appreciate seeing on a daily basis, but I'm an adult about it instead of trying to make it someone else's problem.

&gt; I'm allergic to dogs (but not humans, even small germy ones)

I don't think you get how germs work.  The only thing you need to do to avoid an allergic reaction to a dog is to not pet it.  She's not shedding dander into the air at a rate which will bother you.  What, are you going to roll around on the floor at that grocery store trying to get you bare skin to touch dog hair?  On the other hand, maybe that germy kid touched the cheese you bought or the counter top you touched and now you have the flu.

&gt; find it a bit rude that people bring their pets into stores that explicitly forbid them.

Well yeah, if they explicitly forbid it then that would be rude.  However, the stores I go to don't explicitly forbid it.  In fact, many of them have the exact opposite attitude.  I'm not talking about trying to force my dog down people's throats at stores where we aren't welcome.

"Nope. They were all over the city. However, they were mostly privately-owned and unprofitable. Developers would build a streetcar line from Downtown to their housing development in order to attract buyers. For example, the line you're referring to on Woodland Park Ave N was built by [Guy Phinney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Carleton_Phinney) (the namesake for Phinney Ridge) in order to sell homes around Green Lake. 

Once all the homes were sold, they'd be stuck with the lines and losing money in operations. After the lines traded hands a bunch of times, with each owner losing money, the City of Seattle eventually agreed to take ownership of them all. The city incurred lots of debt operating them all, but was able to eventually secure a federal grant to pay off the debt. An independent commission took over and converted all of the lines to ""trackless trolleys,"" many of which still operate today with their overhead wires powering the electric buses.

"It is a complex issue. You cannot just build houses for everyone and expect it to solve the issue. SLC did it, i know, but Seattle is not the same as SLC. Look at the issues Ballard is having with the RV lots, not the same as housing but a good indicator. 

Looking at some of the ""camps"" in my neighborhood, the people staying there literally trash the place right where they sleep (there seems to be a growing number of bikes around all the time too) when there are trash cans nearby. What do you think they would do with a house?

I am not totally against it, I am not happy with current resources available. But this is a very complex issue and there is no simple solution. I personally feel way more needs to be done on a Federal level (Why it hasn't be a talking point in the Presidential debate, I don't know. A lot of states are struggling here). There is a redditor here who is homeless in Capitol Hill and he did and AMA about a month back in this sub and he said there are a lot of homeless people who are addicted to that lifestyle and they wouldn't take a home if you gave it to them - I assume they are a minority but I just want to emphasize that there is no easy, complete solution

&gt; You don't just move if you have mental health issues.

Haven't states like Nevada been caught sending homeless people to San Francisco? Why wouldn't they do the same here if they knew they would just get houses? NYC pays travel fees for someone who is homeless if they can prove they have relatives in another state to take them in. Would other states not just advertise free travel to Seattle where you will get a free house and if that doesn't work out for you, the weather is never that extreme and the cops don't cite you for as much as CA or other states.",,,,EyeSightToBlind,,,1462245733,t5_2qhad,t3_4hiwa1,t1_d2qhorq,10,1465596993,0,0,d2ql4sc,Seattle,10,,

"""Pretty damn good""? You're joking, right? Mass Transit in all other major metropolitan cities in the US including Portland, SF, LA, Atlanta, New York, Boston etc are a lot better and more complex than our simple one line light rail that goes from the airport into the city. Let's not even get started on the rest of the world and how their mass transit compares to Seattle's. 

edit: I would consider myself a native of Seattle too and the main reason why I complain is because the Seattle Process is a real thing and our mass transit (Light Rail) could be 100x better than it is at the moment but due to whatever the hell goes on during their ""process"", we don't. They even decided to go ahead with the new 520 bridge without building a light rail track on it?

We need to decide specifically and explicitly what standard of living should be accessible to someone who works 40 hours a week at a minimum wage job: Sufficient to rent a living space of at least X square feet within Y minutes commute of their place of work, and afford a typical grocery list consisting of at least Z from grocery stores in the area, etc. etc. Then work out on a region-by-region bases exactly what minimum wage is required to support that lifestyle given the current market.

That makes the debate about the thing that actually matters: quality of life. Plus, it would require conservatives to state once and for all, on the record, precisely what they believe the standard-of-living of a minimum-wage worker should look like. It would also mean more incentive for municipalities to lower cost of living through things like rent control (or building more affordable housing) and providing adequate public transit (since cost of commute would be factored in).

"I'm always amazed when anti-growth folks argue that the reason they don't won't growth is that they want to ""protect affordable housing"". It just demonstrates a basic ignorance of economics on their part. The reason housing prices here are rocketing up is because supply is not keeping up with demand.

The way to keep prices in an affordable range, is to allow more supply. Now, I'm allow for increasing that supply in a smart and sustainable way, but we clearly need a lot more supply.

"From the Seattle Subway FB page:

Why did Sound Transit waste $850k of taxpayer money on a party?

First off, they didn't. Over 50% of the costs were associated with crowd management, police overtime, and marketing for the opening of service. Nearly all of those costs would be required even if there were no “party” - just to deal with opening day crowds and to advertise the opening of service. 

Second, U-Link opened $200M under budget and the event/advertisement worked: Just in the first month since opening ST has taken in over $1M more in fares than expected - more than covering the expense of the marketing effort. 

Attempting to cast a project that was delivered $200M under budget and has ridership thousands of people/day higher than expected anything other than an unqualified success is a desperate attempt by anti-transit advocates to foment controversy around a massive victory for our city and region.

"Yes, especially in Seattle. I used to work in a school in White Center and the achievement gap was huge. Most of the white kids came from families that were doing at least okay financially while most of the students of color were first generation Americans with parents who worked very low wage service industry jobs, if they were able to get jobs at all due to language barriers. A lot of the black students came from generations of poverty. I remember seeing one particularly hard conversation go down between two kids after spring break where the white kid was telling the black kid that he and his family went skiing. Meanwhile, the black student spent several nights of spring break sleeping in his dad's car and most of the rest of the nights at his mom's house where he took care of his younger siblings while his mom worked until 10 pm. These kids both lived in White Center and neither deserved to be in the situation that they were in.

"Thanks for starting this discussion. This is something we're continually trying to message about, often in conjunction with our Work Zone safety messaging but also just in general because it is such a major issue. I know when I do ride-alongs with our Incident Response Teams or am out at a job site, it is alarming how many people I see on their phones while they're driving. Talking to our road workers, they say the one thing they'd ask people to do is to focus on the road, it would make a huge difference in safety. It's a rare day when they don't have some kind of close call, and it's often because people just aren't paying attention and are checking to see if people reacted to the picture they posted of their lunch, or whatever. The State Patrol said the top 3 reasons for work zone crashes are speeding, following too closely and inattentive driving, and 96 percent of people hurt in work zone crashes are the motorists, their passengers or pedestrians.

"I ride my bicycle on Seattle public streets daily. Some advice, in no particular order:

* Learn and follow the bicycle laws in [Washington](http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/bike/Laws.htm) and [Seattle](http://www.seattle.gov/transportation/bikecode.htm).
* Follow traffic laws while riding your bicycle. With some exceptions, riding a bicycle is like driving a car as far as traffic laws are concerned. Speaking from years of experience, it's much safer and drivers will understand you better. Use hand signals. Predictability is life.
* [Read about common types of collisions and how to avoid them.](http://bicyclesafe.com) Note that many of these types of collisions can be avoided by taking the lane, which may seem counterintuitive at first but it does work.
* Assume you are invisible to any particular driver until proven otherwise. Any time a driver passes you, assume your presence has immediately been purged from that driver's memory. Assume cab drivers are actively trying to kill you. Ride defensively just as you would drive defensively.
* Stay out of the [door zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Door_zone).
* Wear a helmet. It's the law in Seattle and it's worth spending a few bucks to protect your head.
* Use lights, at least one each front and back, day and night. I have six lights, as I don't want a driver to get away with causing a collision by uttering the magic words ""I didn't see you.""
* A cable lock will not slow a thief down at all. Get a strong U-lock (preferably at least a Kryptonite Evolution equivalent or better). Standard/cheap U-locks can be defeated with strong bolt cutters. [Use your U-lock properly](http://www.sheldonbrown.com/lock-strategy.html).
* Lock your wheels with a secondary lock (a cable is OK here *only when used in conjunction with a U-lock*). Even better than a secondary cable is replacing your wheel/seat/etc. quick release skewers with locking skewers. Several good locking skewer products are available, ask your local bike shop (LBS) or google it.
* Darkness and time are a thief's allies. No lock is foolproof; better locks buy you more time. Always keep your bicycle indoors overnight.
* Keep your bicycle well maintained. Ask your local LBS for maintenance tips. At the very least, keep your tires at the recommended pressure and grease your chain every couple of weeks if you're riding often. It is normal to need to top off your tire pressure every week or two. Low tire pressure can cause punctures (""pinch flats"").
* Register your bike on [bikeindex.org](http://bikeindex.org). It's completely free and may help your bicycle be returned to you in case it is stolen.",,,,pentium4borg,Ballard,,1464031882,t5_2qhad,t3_4kp6s5,t3_4kp6s5,16,1466048538,0,0,d3gr9tv,Seattle,16,,flair

"Well for one thing, there's a very different history of how different minority groups got to this country. It's fascinating to read up/listen to podcasts about (I recommend backstoryradio.org, esp their episode on China-US relations).

 But for example, many of our 'model minority' groups come from populations where we only accepted high-income, highly educated people from that racial group as immigrants. So Chinese and Japanese immigrants for a while were already coming from backgrounds of relative prosperity. Take, on the other hand, Asian populations that came here largely as refugees (Cambodian, Laotian, etc) and you see much larger achievement gaps. 

Now consider the history of anti-black racism in American wealth, education, and general society, and you can start to see that likewise, there are structural reasons outside some sort of innate 'culture' that contribute, over the course of generations, to these kinds of gaps. My personal background in in Native American identity politics, where you see a similar, but distinct phenomenon. The over-arching point is that blaming people for their poverty and telling them to pull themselves up by their bootstraps because-that-other-minority-group-is-doing-just-fine doesn't work.

"Carty McCartface

Carty McCartface (born 1960, People's Republic Of Unincorporated King County) makes sculptures, installations and conceptual artworks. By replaying the work for each exhibition and pushing the evocative power of the work a little further, McCartface tries to focus on the activity of presenting. The character, shape or content of the presented artwork is secondary. The essential things are the momentary and the intention of presenting.

His sculptures are notable for their perfect finish and tactile nature. This is of great importance and bears witness to great craftsmanship. By creating situations and breaking the passivity of the spectator, he considers making art a craft which is executed using clear formal rules and which should always refer to social reality.

His works are based on inspiring situations: visions that reflect a sensation of indisputability and serene contemplation, combined with subtle details of odd or eccentric, humoristic elements. By focusing on techniques and materials, he often creates work using creative game tactics, but these are never permissive. Play is a serious matter: during the game, different rules apply than in everyday life and even everyday objects undergo transubstantiation.

His works are presented with the aim not to provide an idealistic view but to identify where light and the environment are important. The energy of a place and its emotional and spiritual vibrations are always important. By taking daily life as subject matter while commenting on the everyday aesthetic of middle class values, he wants the viewer to become part of the art as a kind of added component. Art is entertainment: to be able to touch the work, as well as to interact with the work is important.
His works are characterised by the use of everyday objects in an atmosphere of middleclass mentality in which recognition plays an important role.

Carty McCartface currently lives and works in Tukwila.",,,,hovercraft_mechanic,Columbia City,,1462428657,t5_2qhad,t3_4hxur4,t1_d2thli7,17,1465647731,0,0,d2ti2yd,Seattle,17,,flair

I've read your comment several times trying to figure out exactly what you're arguing for. Are you saying that parking minimums need to be present so that car owners interests will be represented? What about all those people who don't own cars? Cars are already the most subsidized form of transportation on the planet. The developer should be required to build spaces because you don't want to pay the cost of market rate parking at a garage nearby? Your argument seems to be that because lots of people drive now we should keep making it easy for them to drive, which is the exact opposite of a smart growth strategy for an ever-densfiying city.

"I've been in this same situation as a kid and it never ended like this for me but then I never tried to run or bike away. Technically she was trespassing. If you watch the video you will be that just before she tried to bike away the cop takes out a notebook and pen. He is taking down her information. He is doing this so that if anyone reports that their car was broken in or vandalized he can contact her. The only time you're going to be arrested for trespassing is if you are nuisance.

When he try to stop her from getting away she runs from him and when he gets a hold of her she fight and continues to fight and to try to run away. At the same time you can see the boy with is told to sit on the ground and he does so. The cop doesn't touch him until he tries to get up. As long as he is doing what the cops say he doesn't get touched, even after trying to stand up. It'll be interesting to learn what a jury says about all of this because they are going to watch and analyze it frame by frame.

"i'm new to the area, so i might not know much more than you. but i'm working with caseworkers with an agency that helps the homeless downtown while crashing at my friend's place (i'm REALLY LUCKY to be able to store my stuff. shelters act like that's not important.) 

i came here expecting to get into a shelter that advertises itself as one of the main emergency shelters for my demographic (single woman). I came, they said no, no emergency shelter is offered here at all, down the road there's a tent city, though- maybe they're taking places. (said representative lied. in social services it's actually common to either say no there's no space or no, we don't even offer what the website says we offer if you don't think that person can handle your program) 

i made my way downtown and *almost* slept on the street until some kind soul told me about city hall, which is a shelter the salvation army puts on for the street homeless. you can't keep any of your stuff there, so i was lugging around my suitcase, backpack, and one other bag all day. 

''Why did you come to seattle homeless? you bum! stay where you were!''
i was going to be homeless where i was. and i was struggling to find a job. there's NOTHING for homeless single women there. all the shelters automatically say no, no matter how many beds are open, unless you have some kind of job. i had just gotten cut from my temp job and my close friend offered me $ and a plane ticket.

i've always dreamed of moving here.  and when you're unconnected and unemployed, as well as possibly homeless, well...why not move? so i did. there's more industry here, as well as more social service. i'm applying hard for jobs now that i have the ability to look professional sans luggage and plan on pulling my weight.

it's only due to my friends, though, who let me crash with them in exchange for me helping with the utility bill and around the house.

i *could* still be at city hall and lugging my suitcase around.

i'm not saying drugs and mental illness don't play a huge role in street homelessness -they totally do.  and not every chronically homeless person *wants* to become a functioning Seattleite for a variety of reasons.

i *am* saying that there are also those of us who are trying and because of stereotypes about homeless people that affect the mayor and shelter shutdowns and the fact that tent cities are the main emergency shelter offered here in king county, it's harder than you think to get back up.

but really, it'd be cheaper for the city to just offer more shelters and stuff like that. right now ,they're paying a lot of taxpayer $$$ for removal of homeless people's belongings from tent city as well as emergency room fees and day centers. homeless shelters and transitional housing with a permanent supportive housing option for those who qualify is a *much* *cheaper* option. instead of looking down on the homeless who don't want to get back to life, look down on the politicians who know there's a better cheaper way to use your tax $$$ (it's demonstratably worked in other metro areas) and refuse to take it.",,,,Gottagetanediton,,,1463513993,t5_2qhad,t3_4js2yg,t1_d395s5s,38,1465918284,0,0,d397pw5,Seattle,38,,

"Mmm.. I'm a bit conflicted because years of following the rules tells me to keep this world a secret, but setting the record straight with people that may have an intrest/respect for the art (but are just unaware of how deep things are) kinda motivate me shine some light on the truth of it all a bit. I don't know..

I thought about doing an AMA once, but I think it's kinda self absorbed to do so, especially when there's ambassadors more respected and recognized than me who I respect and trust to decide what the public could or should know.

I can't tell you everything of course, but I can say this : 

There are pretty much 5 traditional forms of graff, all of which have their own functions, uses, and significance. They are tags, stickies, throwies/bombs, and pieces.

*Tags* are single color, single line ""signatures"" on universally accepted mediums like USPS mailboxes, bus stops, inside of busses, newspaper bins, etc. They are your signature. They are done with paint pens, *mops* (extra drippy paint pens that you make yourself of out various materials, along with making your own ink from ink recipes passed down), or simply just a single color of spray paint. 

Tags have their own place and importance because they are the fastest of all forms of graff, showcase the basis of your letter form to world what your complex pieces have evolved from, and let the graff community know you're still alive. They showcase what is called your *handstyle*, hand, or handsteez. Your handstyle is essentially the foundation of the letter form that complex multi color pieces that take hours to paint have evolved from. You need to let the graff world you're alive and you exist, so putting in some work (but not overdoing it) in this avenue is a necessary evil. The public hates this the most, but if you do it in appropriate places and actually have developed a good handstyle, the graff community will give you *some* respect after your style is carefully critiqued and analyzed, although this is the lowest denominator of respect, as they are the least risky and fastest to produce, and fastest form to learn and increase your skill in. Bonus points for creative placement, ease of getting to that spot, use of clearly homemade mops with homemade inks, and of course most importantly, a completely unique and beautiful style.

*Stickies* are the next form of graff. They are stickers that you make, traditionally out of stolen postage stickers from the oost office. They are those paper postage labels with the USPS logo on them and a decent whitespace to draw a character you created or your name. *Thanks USPS!* You should take time to draw a multicolored piece with drawing markers or paint pens and put some effort in to them. Usually people slap them around bus stops, metal poles, busses, subways, pay phones, and community spots that have a lot of other stickies from many other artists all in one place. The respect you get from this in the community is determined soley on style, placement, time consumed making each sticky, and volume. The community spots where you might find many stickies from many graff artists is a place where the artists have put their sticky and they return to look at it and see who else is new in town. You critique styles here and if you see something you like, you might keep your eyes open for his name later.

*Throwies* or throw ups or *bombs* are bubble/block letter, single color/two color, fast, forms of your name with or without  fill color. Again, style, placement, speed and volume are what gain respect here. Some writers have different philosophies about throw ups. Some stray from them altogether, some only do throwies and bombs and just focus on shear overwhelming volume, some use them just as one small piece of the graffiti diet and do them simply because as a graff artist, you *should* do them and perfect all forms. It just depends what your personal philosophy is, but traditionally, if your handlers are good, they should tell you to dabble in *all* froms of graffiti, and that these single/dual color bubble letter, large forms of your name are just another slice of the pie of who you are. Bonus points for high risk spots like police stations, police cars, busses stopped at red lights, dangerous bridge overpasses, etc. They are fast and critique of your bubble style or block letters is considered vital.

More on the final form, pieces, later...",,,,RationalLies,,,1463554590,t5_2qhad,t3_4j9jka,t1_d39lfi1,11,1465930882,0,0,d39xuvf,Seattle,11,,
"&gt;If anyone noticed I was a person of color, they either didn't care or were grateful for the exonerating power of my presence. (""This campaign can't be racist! There was a woman of color at the phone bank today!"")

Yeah, I'll go with they probably didn't care (or even notice that) that the author was half-Filipino. I would be surprised if anyone in that room was nearly as obsessed with race as she is.

&gt;To my surprise, I wasn't the only woman in the room. 

I don't understand why someone would be surprised by that. Trump's disapproval rating among women is 70%- that means that roughly 30% of women hold either neutral or favorable impressions of trump. 30% is a lot- even if only 1/2-1/3 of that 30% holds strongly favorable  views that would still put Trumpettes at 10-15% of the female population or roughly the population of the united state's that is black (13-14%).

Are you surprised when you see a black person on the tv, on the cover of a magazine or on the street? Of course not; in fact black people are roughly as well represented on the television as they are in real life. So if you're not surprised by a black person on your television why would you be surprised by a female trump supporter?

"This meeting is being held by Matt Fox and his anti-density supporters. It would be good to hear from the proponents of density at this meeting.

I think Fox's negative opinions on density in the University District are the minority opinion and the majority of University District stakeholders, residents and business owners support the increased density being proposed. 

The University District is at a unique geographic nexus of a world class educational institution, business / residential district and also will be on a multimodal transportation hub. Increased zoning in this area is a ""no brainer"" good thing for the City and would increase the vibrancy and development of housing in the area.

Also the proposed up-zoning should be applied uniformly throughout the area and should especially include University Way (which is currently proposed as not made significantly higher). If excluded, the Ave will become a wall of 6 story apartments instead of inviting diverse taller and further spaced developments (ala Vancouver BC vs the current plethora of Ballard box apartment projects).

The short answer to the question: ""Is it as crazy as it seems?"" is probably no, it's even *more* crazy than it seems, if you want to buy a home in the same places everyone else wants to buy, which right now is indeed North Seattle and the Eastside.

I'm not going to say what anyone else should do, but if I were thinking about buying a home right now, I wouldn't. I don't know how or when things will cool off, but I strongly suspect there will be better times to buy in the next few years.

The only real positive for buyers today are the still-absurdly-low interest rates. Prices = all-time high and increasing at one of the fastest rates ever. Supply = all-time low. Demand (i.e. your competition) = relatively strong.

Historically speaking, this is one of the worst times to buy a home, ever.

Again, this is just my opinion. It's not advice about what anyone should do. You should do your own research and make a decision based on your own unique financial situation and life circumstances.",,,,TheTim,"Tim Ellis, SeattleBubble.com &amp; Ellis.FYI",,1462917254,t5_2qhad,t3_4iqngn,t1_d30gxw8,16,1465768401,0,0,d30ikkl,Seattle,16,,flair verified

"&gt; Really? Did you read the article?

Yeah. If you had any education on organized labor whatsoever you'd understand that not all labor unions with every business in every sector in every region are the exactly the same.

Generalizing about labor unions is as ignorant as generalizing about labor. They are not single, homogenous entities. 

&gt; The union did NOTHING for me.

That sounds unfortunate. You should do some homework on the history of labor unions. Labor unions *have* helped you. Labor unions have brought this country: the weekend; mandated breaks at work; paid vacations; Family &amp; Medical Leave Act (FMLA); sick leave; Social Security; minimum wage; Civil Rights Act/Title VII (prohibits employer discrimination(; the 8-hour work day; mandated overtime pay; Child labor laws; Occupational Safety &amp; Health Act (OSHA); the 40-hour work; workers' comp; unemployment insurance; workplace safety standards and regulations; wrongful termination laws; Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA); whistleblower protection laws; sexual harassment laws; Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA); laws ending sweatshops in the United States, etc.

"I appreciate your edit.  Calling me out for not responding to you while I'm at work is pretty ridiculous.  Have some patience before you go for the full on:

&gt; EDIT: Got it: You have no facts or evidence whatsoever to support your causal claim.

I spent some time this evening looking through ACS data and even found the lone statistic that supports your claim that black income is plunging in Seattle (hint: you have to use a very specific measure, it isn't seen in others).  And I used that to make this graph:

http://i.imgur.com/xohBvrs.png

There's an obvious and inverse correlation between median family incomes in Seattle and the county as a whole (which includes Seattle).  If I could remove Seattle City from the MSA figures it would strengthen the conclusion.  Black families have actually seen *rising incomes* across the MSA as a whole.  This suggests to me that not only is ""black middle-class flight"" a thing but that also blacks are seeing modest improvements in this economy.

Note that the scales are different.  The median family income in Seattle has changed much more dramatically than that in the MSA.  The black population is half-a-dozen times bigger in the MSA than the city.  If a large portion of middle class families were moving out of Seattle to the MSA we'd expect a big negative shift in the Seattle numbers and stagnant MSA numbers.  What we actually see is a significant negative shift in the Seattle numbers and a positive shift in the MSA numbers.  This suggests an overall improvement for black families in the area and a hemorrhaging of middle-class black families from the city limits.

There may be some advantage overall from selective immigration, but it doesn't explain away the success that Asian students have had.

Planning growth and the number of people in a given area is important when you are providing those services.

For example:  I live way out in the burbs, but when they designed the sewer system for my neighborhood they found that they undersized it for the number of people in the neighborhood itself and had to go back and alter the sewer plan AFTER a bunch of homes had been built.  It ended up costing the city and the neighborhood and eventually the HOA additional money to retrofit the sewer to handle the extra users.

"I am usually the type of person what will tolerate almost any level of customer service. If food is bad, waiters are rude, whatever, I will usually just smile and accept that things happen. No big deal.

However, Good to Go is a bridge too far. A story: I moved from Ballard to West Seattle in 2012 and shortly after I renewed my driver's license and assumed this would update my car registration too. (Not sure why I thought those two systems were connected, but I did) Anyway, I rarely drive any of the toll roads, but between 2012 and 2015 I crossed 520 during tolled hours a handful of times. Because I was expecting to be mailed a bill, I would usually put it out of mind after crossing and just wait for the bill. So, when the bills never came it never even registered to me.

So, the next Spring (2013) when I updated my tabs I used my new address. BUT, for some damn reason this did not actually update the address my car was registered under (despite the fact the tabs were mailed to this address). So another year passes of my toll bills being sent to an old address (and not being forwarded). Now, it's 2014 and I update my tabs again. Another year passes, same thing.

So, in 2015 I go to update my tabs. Guess what? I can't, because I have 7 or 8 toll bills from the past 4 years that have now accrued something like $300 in late fees and they have placed a hold on my registration. Ok. That sucks, but I guess I should have remembered that I was never billed for those trips and looked into it. I ask the woman at the licensing office if I may pay with a credit card and she tells me that I cannot pay my fines here, I must pay through Good 2 Go. Alright. I then ask her, ""If I pay them, will it lift the hold on my tabs?"" Yes, she says.

So, I call Good 2 Go, but they won't let me pay my phone. Online, I ask? Nah, I don't have the billing numbers for the bills I never received. I have to come in, but not today they said, computer issues. So, I drive up to the U-District the next day (on my now expired tabs) and I wait in line. Finally, it's my turn. Unfortunately, the guy behind the counter says that the computers just went down and I should come back in an hour. I go grab lunch and come back. Well, now a sign says they have closed for the day. Okay. I can't make it back for a couple days due to work commitments, so I'm still driving on expired tabs. I finally make it in and pay the tolls. Great, only downside is they are having another computer issue and can't print a receipt. I head to the licensing office to update my tabs. The woman tells me I have a hold on my registration for unpaid tolls. I tell her, nah I paid the tolls. She then informs me that they have know way of knowing because the Good 2 Go system doesn't ACTUALLY TALK TO THEIR SYSTEM. Apparently, these holds are manually applied and removed and it can take several weeks. Well, I'm now in week two of expired tabs so fuck that. What can I do, I ask her? She says I can get a receipt from Good 2 Go and bring it to her. I call Good 2 Go, and explain that I was never given a receipt, but could I get an emailed receipt or something similar. Nope, they say. I can get a fax. Ok, licensing lady, can I use your fax? Nope. ok.

I drive my expired tabs car back to work just to receive a fax and then drive back to the licensing place and fucking finally update my tabs. Then I drank heavily and considered abandoning all of my big government political beliefs.",,,,pjc_nxnw,West Seattle,,1462898486,t5_2qhad,t3_4ilt88,t3_4ilt88,10,1465761361,0,0,d303sr8,Seattle,10,,flair

"Thanks, Inslee. You've managed to *add* to the growing support for Trump, which has evolved exclusively because of emotional and popular appeals in the media and government. You're certainly not helping the state by twisting a public figure's words into some big discussion about race, gender, and inclusion. Just so we're clear: Trump has bagged the GOP nomination specifically because his supporters are Americans who *know* people would rather talk about feelings on racism, bathroom bills, and other shit, and go to extreme lengths to direct attention to things like ""inclusion"" and ""equality"" so they don't have to answer for things like migrants from Mexico and Central America further emboldening economically corrupt governments by fleeing; migrants who end up taxing public services because they have no education, no job skills, and thereby cannot integrate into US culture. Or the current Syrian refugee crisis, which isn't a concern for Islamic extremism, but for the fact that moderate Islam is *completely counter-intuitive* to American values and that moderate Muslims from these regions isolate within and resist integration into Western cultures, as they have done in France, Belgium, and Germany; and that is how Islamic extremists are able to organize and operate within Western societies. We don't worry for progressive Islam. We worry for moderate Islam because anti-Western rhetoric is commonplace in those communities, and all someone needs to become an ""extremist"" is to pick up a gun. The mass immigration of Syrians into the US could instantly create Muslim-dominated communities that are difficult to police and maintain authority in, and we simply cannot afford to let this happen to people already living in the US. We just recently saw this type of isolation play out with Mormons in Arizona, and the results were absolutely horrifying for residents in those two communities. With isolated Islamic communities, we will see the same thing play out.

I don't believe Trump is the best candidate, but I certainly acknowledge that Trump is popular because he has shamelessly exposed the emotional and popular fallacies of American culture that are directly responsible for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, NAFTA, and the expectation and demands for US intervention every time a genocide or civil war or argument breaks out somewhere else in the world. *We can't make* the Middle East get its shit together. *We can't make* North Korea and South Korea get along. But because people *feel* like we're privileged first-world citizens, we can afford to *make* things happen when other people can't. Trump is the first person to say we *can't* fix things like the genocide in Darfur. *We can't make* China play fair economically. *We can't end* hunger in Africa simply because we throw out hundreds of millions of dollars in food waste each year.

The world is littered with issues, but the US became a first-world country because it took responsibility for its own issues and made progress to correct them. We threw out state religion. We were among the first countries to end legal slavery. We were among the first countries to guarantee equal access to employment for women. We pushed for international trade expansion. We prioritized national defense. We prioritized market capitalism. And while I am lucky to have been born an American, I'm not responsible for South Sudan's government corruption any more than Nigeria is responsible for the conflict between Taiwan and the PRC. It's not America's job to go to South Sudan and tell everyone to play fair. The South Sudanese have to do that for themselves. And if they need help, the US can't just show up and finish the job while they go back to the countryside and do the laundry. There was a time we had a King park ships in an east coast harbor to force us into paying exorbitant taxes, and we got fed up with that shit and did something about it. We had a little help, sure, but we fought for our freedom--even the people who weren't considered a full human fought for our freedom.

Trump may be the guy everyone thinks is a racist or a misogynist, but there's not a single thing he's ever explicitly said against Latinos or against women. When Trump wants to ""build a wall"", all people talk about is how Trump *really said* he wants ""Latinos out of the country"", and how there are all these ""implications"" to the greater discussion of racism and ""white privilege"". And, honestly, it's that spin on Trump that's turned him into a fountainhead. Donald Trump is the guy everyone keeps pushing forward because Donald Trump is exposing the modern American doublespeak we get from major media, from public officials, from our neighbors... everywhere we go, be-it our work, the grocery store, or school. Trump won't be a good president. In fact, he'd likely be worse than George W. Bush. But Trump is someone who has finally exposed the great American fallacy: Rile people up about social injustice and they'll stop talking about wars, free trade agreements, nuclear proliferation, corporations paying effective tax rates of 3%, creeping and continually rising taxes on low income Americans. Bundle any law or tax hike into something ""fighting social injustice"", and no one cares to be skeptical about it. No one remembers that every tobacco tax rate hike was done specifically to help child's health... and every program created under those tax hikes has been foreclosed and the tax funds folded into the state's general funds.

Anyway, I'm done rambling. Trump, however, will continue to move forward. He may not win the election (and I don't honestly care if he does or does not, because it's a *single* branch of government), but he has certainly made Americans more skeptical. And we need that. We need to see headlines and think, ""that's fucking media bias and editorial spin"". Because not doing so has led us into three wars, trillions of dollars spent on the War on Drugs, trillions more spent on ""defense"" with zero accountability for where each dollar is going, and constant, rising taxation at every turn while our commute to and from work triples due to an inefficient infrastructure. Trump has been good for America because he's a perfect example of how far ""journalists"" will go to spin a four-word sentence into ""implications"" for the ""greater discussion"" of ""social justice"", and ultimately how *that spin* deliberately distracts us from getting shit done because it's *easier* and less stressful for politicians and everyone else to figure out a social injustice than it is to plan and execute an end to a 13-year, $1 trillion dollar war that should not have happened in the first place. But we have to plan and execute, because just as is said about love, social justice doesn't pay the bills, so spending all day on it isn't going to get us any closer to paying off the national debt or reducing the congressional budget deficit.",,,,boxedupjosh,,,1462665243,t5_2qhad,t3_4iapib,t3_4iapib,32,1465705951,0,0,d2wvv20,Seattle,32,,

"For some perspective on the NBA in Seattle you kind of have to look at how we lost the Sonics in 2008. It started when Howard Shultz (CEO of Starbucks) purchased the team in 2001. He was a shitty owner to say the least, but an NBA team was a great investment. He sold the team to a group of Oklahoma City Businessmen in 2006. 
The Key Arena had been renovated 12 years earlier, but was one of the smallest arenas in the NBA at the time. The new ownership wanted to update KeyArena with funding from the city but were turned down. They then proposed that we build a $500+ million arena in Renton. It was a pretty ridiculous plan that they knew would get rejected. They then started petitioning the NBA to allow them to relocate the franchise to OKC (on the grounds our arena was insufficient).  However, the team was still under contract to play at Key Arena through 2010. In the end, the city was paid to let them break their lease with Key Arena and they moved the team before the '08-'09 NBA season. 

Ever since, we've had investors willing to buy a team, but nothing has come to fruition. Chris Hansen and Steve Balmer almost successfully purchased the Sacramento Kings a few years ago, but Sacramento came up with the resources to keep the team. Since that deal fell through, Steve Ballmer (Microsoft) purchased the LA Clippers for $2B and is no longer able to help us land a team here in Seattle. The NBA owners aren't willing to add an expansion team (as their slice of the pie would shrink) but the NHL is looking to expand in the West. So the idea now is, build a new arena in SODO (1st &amp; Holgate) and attract potential NHL and NBA teams with a sweet arena.

"You are absolutely right. We are truly entering a scary new post-world war age. What surprises me most is that liberals and conservatives refuse to admit that there is any truth in each others statements. Whether its race, immigration, religion, the conservative concerns merit attention and have some truth. Instead liberals call them 'bigot', 'racist' and simply refuse to listen to them. I find this name-calling infuriating ... On the other hand, conservatives are usually close-minded and cannot/ will not entertain logic and new information. They simply don't trust expertise/ information anymore ... think about it, in the age of information, we have an inflation of the information currency. Even a lot of it has little value. 

It seems to me that even in this connected world we are mostly living in our chosen bubbles. We cannot empathize with individuals outside our own bubble. Perhaps it says something about the limitation of the human brain. There was a study regarding how many close friends we can have on Facebook. That number was around 30 (?) although the total number of friends can be several hundreds. I posit something similar happens in our worldly interaction. We really cannot sympathize with more than a few humans in one life. Old religions have constantly reminded us to treat the entire humanity as our own, but our physical limitations are simply too great. Even technology cannot generate more empathy.

"So, in high school I was on a FIRST Robotics team - Team 360, from Bellarmine Prep. I graduated, volunteered for 6 years at all levels in Illinois while in college, and now I do it as a job in Istanbul - I'm trying to start and help new teams in Turkey with my friend Ayse. Anyways, we've been travelling to each regional with Turkish teams for the last two months (and we flew to see my grandma in Palm Springs). This past weekend I was in St. Louis for the World Championships - where we fill America's Center and much the Edward Jones Dome with high school kids who build robots and program, and fundraise and do all sorts of amazing things. Two Turkish teams were in the championships which was awesome, and my mentor from when I was on 360 won the highest award you can possibly win as a mentor, out of thousands, he was internationally recognized this weekend as the guy you wanna be like if you're a mentor (one mentor wins it each year, out of thousands). Which was really really awesome!

So yeah, that's why I've been flying so much, my last flight, for hopefully many months is Tuesday, I fly back to Istanbul, finally! I'm really tired of airplanes.

"**tl;dr -** Yes, but with some caveats.

-----

$65k is easily enough to provide a comfortable apartment rental,  a decent car, buy groceries, eat out at restaurants from time to time, and to get your bills paid. It might be a little tight supporting two people on that, but if your wife also works then it will definitely be affordable.

**Some basic estimates:**
65k in base pay. After you back out taxes, health insurance, and retirement contributions it equates to around $48k per year take-home; or $4,000 per month.

**What's a 4k monthly budget cover?**

* 1500 rent (doable in West Seattle)
*  500 for car payment, fuel, insurance, maintenance
*  800 for groceries and restaurants (this is a pretty generous food budget - you can do it alot cheaper if you need to)
*  350 for Bills &amp; Utilities
*  200 for Enterntainment
*  400 for misc expenses (health &amp; fitness, personal care, gifts, random shopping, etc.
*  250 for savings
  
These are just basic estimates but they seem reasonable to me. Of course run the numbers yourself with your own spending priorities in mind.

**Some issues to consider:**

* It probably won't be enough to save up to buy a house, especially in this real estate market. 
* You'll be able to start a family, but this may mean pinching pennies to ensure you've got enough.
* This assumes you're getting decent health coverage and retirement match from your employer. If you aren't - then you'll see more of your 65k as take-home, but you'll have to allocate more of your take-home to those expenses anyway.

**My opinion:** You should do it. Seattle's a great place to live - West Seattle is a unique mix of an urban and suburban 'feel' and the cost of living there isn't too crazy as long as you stay away from the waterfront.",,,,just_foo,Greenwood,,1462465487,t5_2qhad,t3_4hzl20,t3_4hzl20,50,1465655550,0,0,d2tyi6s,Seattle,50,,flair greenwood

"I know a lot of you aren't Republican's, but here's what's going on. Washington GOP is allocating all their delegates by the popular vote of the Primary, but all the delegates are chosen through the caucus. So even though 40 of 41 delegates are Cruz supporters, they're still bound to the primary results. Trump will most assuredly win the primary based on Oregon results, everyone I know, and that one poll like a month ago. It just goes to show how there's a divide between the Republican voters and the leadership. Most caucus goers in Washington are church going types or neoconservatives, but libertarians and blue collar workers make up a majority of the conservative voting base. A lot of the attendees at the convention were wearing red Cruz shirts, even Vance (running for Senate) says he doesn't support Trump. Bill Bryant (governor candidate) wont say who he's voting for, and Susan Hutchinson (Wash GOP chair) is trying to avoid the national election. 

Sorry for the blog post. My jimmies were so rustled I had to post somewhere. Also Vance used to be the GOP chair in Washington but he was terrible and everyone hates him. He basically lost a ton of support for the GOP here because he focused on wedge issues like anti gay marriage and weed. So he quit and went to work in DC for, i think, young Republicans or something. Furthermore, he said we should unite around the primary winner and when Trump won he went back on his word (""I didn't think he'd be the winner!"").

Point being, it was a long shot for Republicans to get a Senate seat and I'm certain it's now an impossibility. Probably same for the governor's race. ",,,,[deleted],,,1463999577,t5_2qhad,t3_4knaca,t3_4knaca,11,1466039262,0,0,d3g7wap,Seattle,11,,

Long and short of it was that PLU (owners of KPLU) wanted to sell the station to UW for $7M to help their budget, but when the public found out about it there was a large outcry.  Since public comment is a huge component in the FCC accepting a transfer ownership of radio frequencies in the public access range, the universities had to capitulate to allow the public to have a chance to acquire the radio station.  

With the money raised, the radio station can potentially be owned by a non-profit organization without obligation to a parent institution.  People were worried about the loss of a well-regarded jazz and local news station in KPLU, especially considering the perceived declining quality of local programming by UW's KUOW.

"I'm an avid rider of both motorcycles and bicycles. There are many types of hazards that riders have to be trained to handle. There's a massive circle jerk in the riding communities about 4-wheeled vehicles being the leading cause of collisions but the statistics just don't back that up. Nearly 80% of motorcycle and bicycle accidents are single-vehicle (falls), collisions with objects or collisions with pedestrians. Most motorcyclists and bicyclists have never taken a safety course, which explicitly goes over tackling hazards like debris and tracks. 

A quarter of all fatalities involve an intoxicated rider.

A defensive driving course for bicyclists should really be encouraged. A requirement for a driver's license endorsement, similar to motorcycles, wouldn't be a bad idea either.",,,,msftdrone,,,1464210606,t5_2qhad,t3_4l0vdo,t1_d3jjtti,13,1466097532,0,0,d3jlj1w,Seattle,13,,

"Hey explorasaurr! The US Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management have this little known thing called ""dispersed camping"" which sounds like what you are looking for. Essentially, drive up any Forest Service road (usually labeled FS 6969, etc.) on any atlas/road map and you can pitch your tent and enjoy the night. Essentially, as long as theres no ""no camping"" signs in sight and you are on federal land, you should be good to go. Make sure you have a Northwest Forest pass at the very least which hangs in your vehicle and permits you access to these lands. I've camped out on many trail-heads or nearby forest service roads using this resource and have never had a problem. Some trail-heads are busier than others or may be prone to car prowls so just a word of warning about camping at ""popular"" trail-heads. The same goes for forest service roads where sketchballs may wander out into to do sketchball things but 99.9% of the time you will be left to your lonesome to enjoy the forest. Our state parks don't have a similar program so no camping on state land (legally at least)

be sure to follow leave no trace principles and of course post your photos next week to reap that sweet sweet karma.

have fun! If you've got a certain hike in mind and are still in need of a spot I could probably point you towards some dispersed camping near the trail. It's really so simple and rarely promoted that most people don't know how easy and accessable it is to find camping in the national forests.

here are some links to peruse.

If you prefer someplace a bit more suburban, Burien has a lot of nice quiet neighborhoods close to the Puget Sound (Seahurst, Inglesea, Shorewood, etc).",,,,SeattleDave0,Madison Valley,,1462461577,t5_2qhad,t3_4hzl20,t3_4hzl20,55,1465654079,0,0,d2tvixk,Seattle,55,,flair

Also, West Seattle is connected to the rest of the city by one large bridge (known by the very original name of 'the West Seattle Bridge'). If you want to live elsewhere in Seattle, start with the areas that have good access to the other side of this bridge - so that means Beacon Hill and Rainier Valley.

Anti-growth types are in some sort of delusion thinking that by locking out new places for businesses to open, it will somehow save their local mom and pop shop when 100% of the time, the end result is the exact opposite. The cost of leasing land increases and its only the yuppie businesses like Steak n' Shake that can afford to lease prime locations because they have corporate backing.

By making it impossible for businesses to stay in Seattle, you are speeding up the rate in which national chains move in and vanilla-fy the city. You want to keep Seattle unique? Don't let national chains outbid local businesses for property.

"Not to sound spoiled, because I enjoy the paths that do exist here, but I have to be constantly on edge when I'm riding to work. If I can count on one hand how many times I would have been hit had I just taken my eyes off the road for 2 seconds, then it was a good commute. Sure, it's safe and great riding on the Burke, but try riding anywhere else and it's every man and woman for themselves out there.

Merging with traffic due to construction? Check.
Merging suddenly right after an intersection with no room to maneuver? Check.
Cars parking in, opening doors on, or swerving into/out of the bike lane? Check.
Out to lunch drivers who run you off the road without realizing what they've done? Check. 

While we might have some nice paths, I'm not sure we deserve to be called best anything, and frankly, the lack of motivation on the Mayor's and SDOT's part to get the paths up to par in the downtown core is very disheartening. The cuts and changes made to the plan passed last year are a slap in the face to any cyclist wanting a safe ride in Seattle.

"all you have is empty rhetoric and slander. seriously, shut up and let the adults solve things.

The somali and amharic black students do better than the english students. I can easily substitute 'american', 'ethiopian', 'somalian' for the 'english', 'amharic', 'somali' labels and be mostly right - the immigrants are doing better. they still look black, they struggle with english on top of the coursework, but they do better. that points to culture as an explanation for the gap. Now, you have to do actual work and verify whether these groups are actually poor refugees or the fleeing middle class from those countries, but even if they are, it just underscores the importance of family valuing academic achievement over other things.

&gt; It is clear you are entirely uneducated in this field, since you ignorantly say ""it's likely culture.""

i say that because even after removing poverty and oppression, american black students still suck. I'm reminded of a group of black families that moved to a nice suburb in colorado - they were professionals, had money, the students were accepted by their peers, but they still had a gap. they hired a pedigreed researcher to find out why, and he pointed the finger at them - they didn't reinforce the lessons at home or require them to do homework as much.

"&gt;  I don't post here often enough to notice and mostly just browse for news.

So here's the thing. If you spent more time (read: too much) on this sub you would find that this is his go-to conversation ender when under pressure. He's got time to do it until he faces criticism, and that's when this excuse comes out. It's reaching meme status at this point.

You're right, civility is definitely preferred. But look at the comments he's made in this thread. He actively removes and subverts legitimate concerns and responds childishly when questioned about doing so. On top of that, the mods here maintain another subreddit /r/seattletransparency to catalog the posts and comments removed from this one. But it's selective, a lot of stuff doesn't get reposted there.

Just so you understand, I'm gonna copy and paste something I wrote elsewhere that details some specific complaints with the modding here. This was originally posted on a subreddit that cannot be linked to from this one. Doing so results in a ban despite there being no mention of that in the rules here.

&gt; The double standard is unreal.
The mod that I will refrain from naming routinely removes submissions that somehow mention local businesses, artists, musicians etc claiming they are spam. Meanwhile, things like Jimmy Johns selling $1 sandwiches or McMenamins opening a new location are allowed to stay on the front page because the local news decided to cover it. It's no secret that corporate news is a joke, and many of the stories are directly or indirectly sponsored by companies to promote themselves. [Read here](http://thebaffler.com/salvos/rest-advertising) to learn lots more about that.

&gt; Limiting spam is a legitimate concern, but it requires a much more nuanced approach than is currently being applied.
But that's just the beginning. Every rule on the sidebar is enforced at the whim of the mod(s) on a daily basis. Transparency is being given the bare minimum of lip service. And every hint of a problem is shut down immediately.

&gt; I don't run around name calling (especially comparing to a certain mid-20th century authoritarian figure) like some folks on this sub.

"Hey you. How ya doin'? Glad to see you didn't care to read my reply to you in yesterday's thread about how these events you claim happened forever ago *did not* happen so long ago.

It is funny how you are interpreting the treaties. Let me break it down for you.

&gt;You're reasonable to amend for wrong doing to someone else for what your ancestors did to someone elses ancestor in to perpetuity.

Everybody likes to paint what happened as being so far away, nobody was around for it. That is straight up wrong.

We are not talking about some distant past in where our great-great-great-great-great-great grandfathers interacted. We're talking about the [forced, government sanctioned, sterilization of Native American women up into the 1970s.](https://cbhd.org/content/forced-sterilization-native-americans-late-twentieth-century-physician-cooperation-national-) We're talking about the [the removal of Indian children from their homes and subsequent banning of their culture,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Indian_boarding_schools) which occurred in Canada until 1996. And we are talking about the violation of the [Pickering Treaty of 1794](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Canandaigua) in the early 1960s that resulted in flooding of native lands and forcing them to sell their lands.

Perhaps the 60s and 70s were too long ago. There is currently a [tribe in Canada that is fighting private and government agencies from building a pipeline on their unceded land.](http://unistoten.camp/) And there are *many* more modern day examples of atrocities happening that can be found with a google search. My point is that all of the bad things you think happened forever ago still have lasting effects and in some cases, continue today. Do not sweep these things under the rug.

You know what the Native Americans *didn't* do? Violate over 400 treaties, force white children to attend boarding schools to erase their culture and let some of them die, [create an insane asylum specifically for whites and sentences Indians for whatever reason and force them to live in horrendous conditions,](http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2011/11/04/hiawatha-asylum-insane-indians), commit a [number of massacres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Massacres_of_Native_Americans) in which many women and children were killed *outside* of a war context (and award medals in some cases to the soldiers who committed such massacres), sterilized white women against their will, [advising whites to eat grass](http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/200209/23_steilm_1862-m/part2.shtml) instead of providing rations for them on the reservations... We didn't do any of that.

Yeah, we did some horrible things too. Difference here is that we didn't commit them on the mass scale of the United States and it wasn't done in a *systematic* manner. We didn't continue the killings outside of war and we didn't impose measures against whites who lost to bring about the assimilation or destruction of their entire race. We didn't constantly violate treaties that were made in good faith. Just because we killed in defense or outright attacked someone out of aggression is **no justification** for what happened. And most importantly: we don't continue to do these things. Stop trying to level out the scales when they aren't even on the same playing field.

You need to study federal Indian policy if you're going to comment on it. Native American tribes as sovereign nations is woven into the Constitution of the United States. We have our status today because *your* government that was and is chosen by *your* people have decided we are not just some other minority group to be stepped on without any kind of legalized standing. Fortunately not everyone in U.S. politics is a genocidal monster.

We do have a lot of problems we need to fix, some caused by ourselves, others caused by history and outside influences today. Eliminating our status as sovereign nations will not help the situation.

And learn that not all natives blame ""white people."" Chances are, if you're white, you haven't done shit to natives and that is fine. But the U.S. government continues to do bad things and I, personally, hold them accountable. Society as a whole gets some blame because they condone it to a degree.

And last, but not least, we were not ""given"" shit by those treaties. Concerning the treaties, only about a third of all the treaties signed were treaties of peace. Most were our agreeing to cede portions of our land in exchange for rights, services, and protection. What those treaties did were secure rights and protection for us because we wanted to avoid war in many cases.

The U.S. government has not given us these rights because they felt bad for us. They have never, ever said that. Rather, based on the trust relationship the U.S. government has with tribes, which is a government-to-government relationship, the U.S. follows some basic elements concerning its federal Indian policy. These elements have been established over time by various Supreme Court cases and legislation. One of those basic elements is the ""Reserved Rights Doctrine,"" in where tribal rights, which include the ability to self-govern, are not ""granted"" (or given) by the United States. They are reserved rights because tribes retain such rights as part of their status as prior and continuing sovereigns within the Americas. (Source: *Indian Tribes as Sovereign Governments - Second Edition* by Charles Wilkinson.)

Treaties are considered the law of the land by the U.S. Constitution. If you want to erase treaties, you are wanting to erase a fundamental element of your own country. These treaties were not made for some pitiful reason. It was because we were **and are** recognized as nations who deserve to be treated as such. That is why the treaties need to remain. The U.S. has an obligation to fulfill them (as stated by themselves, check out the BIA website) and neglecting to honor these treaties could very well result in the death and assimilation of more natives.",,,,Snapshot52,Tacoma,,1463016802,t5_2qhad,t3_4ivzvt,t1_d31mzul,11,1465796374,0,0,d325002,Seattle,11,,flair

"You have to treat it (the hunt) like a 2nd job, you can't wait for your agent to suggest a place to check out. You've got to be on top of it every Tuesday and Thursday. You've got to have your inspector there with you when you check it out for the first time and you've got to be ready to make an offer above list price - plus you need to call bullshit when you see a place that is obviously listed low to entice bidding - but you can use this to your advantage too. I have a friend who made an offer on the 4th of July in Everett on a place that was obviously listed low - The sellers accepted the offer and then tried to reneg.

I've told my story a few times on this subreddit: Thats similar to how we found our place in Feb/March, which happened to be in Georgetown, which is a great location (as close to downtown as Ballard but without the Amazon/Lake Union bottleneck to deal with) but it's a peculiar neighborhood (no schools or grocery, small airport noise and freight near by but I'm so much happier here than in my old neighborhood of Phinney/Ballard). 

We found a newish, well kept townhouse that was being rented by day-sleepers, so it was really tough to make an appointment if you work full-time. We showed up the morning of their first open-house with our inspector. The weather got pretty crappy during the open-house hours, so that probably weeded out some prospects and so only **2 other offers** were made. We won out despite the higher offers because we pre-inspected, it was the only contingency we waived. The other offers didn't inspect.

The real estate agents are only adding to the fire. Our agents boss sat us down and recommended we waive all contingencies if we wanted to be competitive on a couple of earlier bids way out in white center and del ridge. If all the agents are making this recommendation, then that is really messed up. When they told us this ""strategy"" I just about called it quits, renting seemed like an excellent solution.

"&gt;I'd happily pay triple the tax if they got it done in half the time. 

The gorilla in the room that ST is not talking about is the impact of federal funding on completion time frames. So far, the package extends the existing taxing authority from ST2 and adds an additional taxing authority for ST3. The result is your $50B pool of cash over the life of the projects. All of that (guaranteed) money...comes from us. ST can't go around making promises for things they can't guarantee. ST3 stands to have a *huge* influx in additional federal transportation funding. Naming Rogoff as the CEO of ST was, in all likelihood, a much bigger achievement than putting a $50B plan on the ballot. Why? Because ST didn't just buy a D.C. insider...they bought D.C. outright.

Rogoff spent 25 years working in a (largely) Republican Senate creating funding packages and effectuating dispersal of federal transit funding. The guy was *received Senate confirmation* to be under Secretary of Transportation and then was named as the head of the Federal Transit Administration outright.


The guy who was a top federal transit official for the *entire united States* was named to run an under-established regional transit authority in the Pacific Northwest just 3 months before announcing ST3.

"Shepherd spends a significant amount of time on Facebook groups like ""Welcome to Murraysville"" talking about how all the young people (tech workers) in Seattle are lazy and haven't ever really worked for their money and are now ruining Seattle with their ideas, how all homeless people are rapists and druggies and should be jailed (or maybe killed), and generally how gay people and women are terrible/stupid/etc. 

Have those opinions if you want, certainly, but if you're a business owner it might not be a great idea to spend most of your time making inflammatory statements with your real name if you don't want the people you're making those statements about to take notice. 

Freedom of speech is not freedom from consequences.

"A few things.

1) Our downtown grids were laid out by two city founders who weren't cooperating with one another.  One thought the grid should align with the water, the other thought it should align N/S.  One was a drunk (Doc Maynard) and one was a religious teetotaler (Arthur Denny).  The happy fun result is the back end of Belltown is on a diagonal from the rest of town, resulting in many diagonal corners. 

2) Out in the neighborhoods, Aves run N/S and Streets run E/W, very orderly.  But the diagonals run wherever, and tend to be called ""Ways,"" but can also be a Boulevard or a Drive.  The diagonals often were the original hiking trail or horse trail out to these parts of town through what were then wooded areas.  Thus, Lake City Way, East and West Marginal Way, Olive Way, Leary Way and so on.  Denny Way is interesting in that it is an E-W yet named Way not Street.  I think that might be because it ran counter to the Arthur Denny's Belltown grid.  Not sure there.   Several of Seattle's enclaves, like Ballard, Ravenna area, U-District, Greenlake, Georgetown and West Seattle all began life as discrete little towns that then connected to the big city Downtown by a hiking or horse or street car line that eventually turned into a Way.

3) Our geography lends itself to needing to follow the lay of the land, so you get streets that followed the only path from point A to point B, which can be counter to a nice orderly N/S grid, like Madison St., which is another exception. It was actually a perfectly orderly E/W street near downtown (orderly for its grid) then was extended to Lake Washington so it could support a street car, several years before the rest of that part of town was platted.  So it follows its own diagonal, which followed the lowest line/path of least resistance from Downtown to Lake Washington.  Note that they gave up following the water around where First Hill tops out near Broadway Ave / Boren ave, resulting in yet another series of connectors where diagonals join a N/S grid.


There are articles on http://historylink.org that get into this, but most of my knowledge here just came by working at DCLU 25 years ago, and staring at a big street map for hours and hours, asking city engineers questions, and hopefully remembering it / not being too full of it now.  It might all be BS for all I know.  Denny and Maynard not getting along was real though.  I just wasn't able to find a link for that.


tl;dr  I channel old city engineers from a quarter century ago and remember what I learned working at DCLU as a land use library clerk.

Less reactionary response for you sensitive types:  The Urbanist and Seattle Times have opposing views on growth, and Seattle Times has at least a longer term perspective, which does represent a large paying customer base.  The Urbanist might have an audience, but I'd suspect it's less established and less long-term in focus.  Could be wrong, but the Times is a 100 year+ media outlet here, that ought to count for something.  The Urbanist is one of these new-arrival ""lets remake a city to fit some idealized goals"" blogging things, and outside of its own little bubble of influence does tend to not be a widely held view, at least not that I can identify.

"My wife and I just closed on a 2 bed/1.75 bath condo on Westlake Ave.  We paid 1.8% over list, but condos can be different than SFH.  Everyone told us in March that inventory would increase in May-June.  Two weeks into May and the inventory on 2 bed condos is even worse than when we started looking so things are indeed crazy.  The supply/demand intersection is not in your favor but you can do a lot to increase your odds of winning bids.  

First, get your ducks lined up: figure out your price range, get an underwritten pre-approval through a local/regional bank or credit union (I've heard national banks respond slowly), get an agent that is intelligent and has experience in the area you are looking.

When you start seriously looking at places don't get too caught up in pictures or cosmetics.  Some quality places have bad MLS pics that will reduce demand.  Some are slightly less than ""turn-key"" and it scares off buyers without a DIY attitude.  Set your search price limit slightly over ""obvious"" limits like 400k, 500k, etc.

For offers, you pretty much have to pre-inspect unless the place has been sitting on the market for longer than a couple weeks.  Make sure your real estate agent is pulling comps for you so you can put in an intelligent bid.  If you are using Redfin, be sure to factor in the refund you get towards putting in a more competitive bid.  A personal letter with picture might help you win a close bid.  My agent stressed making a ""clean"" offer by reducing contingencies when possible, high down payment, respectful earnest money, and reasonable closing date.",,,,alxkc,,,1462915437,t5_2qhad,t3_4iqngn,t3_4iqngn,22,1465767764,0,0,d30h7x9,Seattle,22,,

"I commute across the Fremont Bridge twice a day, generally during rush hour, though sometimes not. On those rare occasions when I am held up by the bridge opening, I stop and relax, observe the interesting ships passing through the canal, and reflect on the awe-inspiring sight of the bridge itself, which is really a sight to see when fully raised. It's a beautiful bridge, especially when opened.

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fremont_Bridge_\(Seattle\)), the bridge has been open since 1917, and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. The bridge was the first of four to cross the canal; ostensibly, if you were alive prior to the bridge's opening almost 99 years ago, you would have had to cross via ferry, as the Aurora Bridge did not open until 1932.

So, unless someone is more than 99 years old, the Fremont Bridge with it's openings and closings has always been a part of the Fremont to Queen Anne commute. And even if someone is more than 99 years old, the Bridge represents an improvement over pre-1917 commute options.

I see a lot of complaints in /r/seattle about ""making hundreds of people wait while some rich asshole crosses under with their yacht"". When I chose to live across the bridge from my place of work, I took into account the fact that I would occasionally be delayed by the bridge opening. That is a fact of life when your commute goes across what is, according to Wikipedia, ""the most frequently opened drawbridge in the United States."" I would suggest to the people who feel entitled to cross the bridge at their convenience that they grow the fuck up and learn to take responsibility for their life choices a tiny bit more. The world will be a better place.",,,,timtoronto,Queenmont,,1463106411,t5_2qhad,t3_4j2zqb,t3_4j2zqb,11,1465820520,0,0,d33jksq,Seattle,11,,flair

**TL;DR** Spamming is not cool, even if the product is really cool.

I liked the product, I really thought it was fascinating artwork.  But I'm not giving free advertising to products I like or even the ones I don't like on /r/Seattle.  It's just not a good idea.

Advertising is available, and I corresponded with the author of that post several times, talking about the different issues around promoting their artwork.

~~It came down to this: The author didn't want to pay for advertising.~~ **EDIT**: The preceding statement was a mistake on my part, and I regret it.  The author had no idea that advertising was an option at the time of our conversation, and my representation to the otherwise was without merit, and egregious.  I apologize unreservedly and will endeavor not to make any similar mistakes in the future.

"""Khosrowshahi said the company believes the location will help Expedia compete for technology talent, an increasingly hot commodity in the region. ""  
  
If they want to attract talent they would need to compete in salary and RSU (Stocks).  
They pay their employees less than the competition around here.  Their senior people make less than fresh college hires at the major tech companies:  
Looking at their H1B data we can get a pretty good idea of the base salary:  
The median software engineer 1 salary at MSFT is **$117,448.5**   
The median software engineer 1 salary at Amazon is **$112,540**  
The median software engineer 1 salary at Expedia is **$100,262**  
    
The median Senior software engineer salary at MSFT is **$143,094.5**  
The median Software Engineer III (Senior basically) at Amazon is **$141,800**  
The median Senior software engineer at Expedia is **$112,986**    
  
If you factor in the RSUs you get at the other major tech places the total compensation is even worse.  Amazon employees have made a killing from their stock historically.

This ruling does not prohibit the City from banning food waste and compostable paper in SPU-provided garbage cans. It merely renders invalid the provisions of the ordinance and rule that authorize a warrantless search of residents’ garbage cans when there is no applicable exception to the warrant requirement, such as the existence of prohibited items in plain view.

So, to be clear ... sanitation workers can still do ""plain view"" searches (i.e., if the recycle bin has more than 50% garbage, that would likely fit the definition of ""plain view"". They just can't do a search beyond what falls into ""plain view"". And, the fine is off the table.

"Yeah; Bi-Partisan respect, at that. More than anything, a lot of federal funding comes by way of grants and programs that need to be applied for. It's alot easier to present a winning grant proposal when the guy doing the presenting is the same person who authored the policy.

This is pretty much the same reason people who clerk for federal judges are such hot commodities...it's not because they know the law better than someone else...its because a law firm can basically buy insider information on what a judge is thinking (in addition to getting a very hard-working, accomplished person).

And don't get me wrong: a project like this takes a ton of time. Seattle is all up in arms about 25 year completion for ST3 while failing to realize that we still have about 10 more years until ST*2* is complete. That said, cash influx ends up being a big help when it comes to creating financial incentives for expediency from sub-contractors, as well as allowing a little more freedom in purchasing land rights and materials.


Personally, I think ST's presentation of ST3 has been very scripted. ST is a weird hybrid agency, but you'd be hard pressed to find an agency who has done a better job delivering on their promises and being accountable to the public. They have a lot of social capital and they know it. I think ST3 was pitched in draft form (the current form) in order to plan ahead for the political issues that could impede their progress. So, they pitch the plan with the biggest budget and long build times. Also *cough, cough* ...you put the new transit tunnel near the end of the project because you are scared as hell that even the most transit-friendly Seattleite is Bertha-averse (For further reading, [please see how two very nice ladies named Pamela and Brenda were robbed of their names](http://mynorthwest.com/244911/confusion-forces-sound-transit-to-re-think-names-of-tunneling-machines/)).

I'm actually pretty impressed with what the feedback has accomplished so far. For 30 years, Snohomish politicians were screaming about being underrepresented, only to endorse a cheaper, more timely ""spur"" plan for Everett/Paine field. There is also some rumbling that the Kirkland NIMBY's are trying to get in on the action as well.

All in all, I think the project that goes to the ballot in November will look very similar in-city, pretty different in the 'burbs, and probably structured in a way that gives ST the freedom to accelerate or postpone projects in relation to outside funding opportunities.

"Here's a big problem I had with the ST piece. In it, Dudley claims ""Personal cars were used for 82 percent of trips in the Puget Sound region in 2014, down slightly from 86 percent in 1999, according to the Puget Sound Regional Council.""

He seems to be using [this April 2016 report on mode share](http://www.psrc.org/assets/14257/Trend-ModeShare-201604.pdf) for work trips published by the PSRC. But he took the data that helped his point the most by grabbing the SOV usage for the entirety of the Puget Sound while railing against Seattle. Even looking at just King County, the SOV usage drops to 68%. But that still includes many suburban areas that would not be directly subject to these changes.

So what about Seattle, then? And more specifically, what about the biggest job centers in Seattle, that are seeing the most traffic on any given work day? [This April 2015 report using the same data as the 2016 report](http://www.psrc.org/assets/833/trend-t8.pdf) shows that the number of SOV trips to DT Seattle was only *16%* in 2014.

It is a bigger problem for turn lanes because of pedestrians and I have had issues with turning cars doing that, but even if going straight it is not safe behavior.

It is pretty simple: if you are waiting and can turn off your car (bridges/railroads) then sure. But if you can accelerate the vehicle then the phone should be put away.",,,,xarune,Fremont,,1464035561,t5_2qhad,t3_4kookh,t1_d3gparr,20,1466049837,0,0,d3gu13q,Seattle,20,,flair
"Suggestion: 

When is the last time feedback was taken from the subreddit community on the current rules and moderation practices, such as with a survey? 

Maybe it wouldn't hurt to revise *how* moderation is done bottom-up. Obviously some things will be hard required as Reddit rules, but others could be simplified and streamlined. Like this other sub, whatever it is -- just add a ""No doxxing rule"" that explicitly covers linking to problem sites to /r/seattle and voila. Problem solved.

"Check out the original analysis, written by the actual author: http://experimental-geography.blogspot.com/2016/05/employment-construction-and-cost-of-san.html, hidden in a tiny link at the end.

Conclusion (original authors, not shitty medium-content-repackager)

&gt; San Francisco is an expensive city because it is an affluent city with a growing population and no easily available land for development. Sonja Trauss is right that building more housing would reduce rents of both high- and low-end apartments. Tim Redmond is right that building enough housing to make much of a dent in prices would change the visual character of most streets, although the result could be more like Barcelona than like the Hong Kong that he fears. The unsettled question is which of these is the higher priority.

&gt; Building enough housing to roll back prices to the ""good old days"" is probably not realistic, because the necessary construction rates were never achieved even when planning and zoning were considerably less restrictive than they are now. Building enough to compensate for the growing economy is a somewhat more realistic goal and would keep things from getting worse.

&gt; In the long run, San Francisco's CPI-adjusted average income is growing by 1.72% per year, and the number of employed people is growing by 0.326% per year, which together (if you believe the first model) will raise CPI-adjusted housing costs by 3.8% per year. Therefore, if price stability is the goal, the city and its citizens should try to increase the housing supply by an average of 1.5% per year (which is about 3.75 times the general rate since 1975, and with the current inventory would mean 5700 units per year). If visual stability is the goal instead, prices will probably continue to rise uncontrollably.

"The newcomers are coming here because it's an awesome place to live and they want to be part of it. They will keep coming here as long as there are jobs and opportunities and the city isn't falling apart, because that's what people do. 

The only way you can make people stop coming here is by making them stop wanting to come here, and in order to do that you have to make it a shittier place to live. You can drive prices up by refusing to let people build enough housing, which is what we've been doing so far by maintaining these absurdly tight-fisted zoning codes, but that makes things shitty for everyone who isn't rich. Not a good choice in my opinion. Or you can make the city shittier by crippling the economy, as you're proposing to do by clamping down on commercial construction, thereby forcing jobs out of the city and into... well... who knows? Not here. So our economy would stop thriving and people would stop wanting to move here. Again, you get your ""lesser seattle"" fantasy but it sucks for everyone who's not rich. Or, you could make the city shittier by imposing awful prejudiced laws that make us seem like a bunch of assholes, like the anti-trans ""bathroom laws"" in NC or whatever, so that we become uncool and people don't want to be associated with us. But, again, that would make the city suck for those of us who already live here.

So those are your choices: take active steps to make Seattle suck, so that people stop wanting to come here, and deal with the consequences of shitting in your own bed; or deal with it and get used to the fact that change happens and people move to good places when they're good. Always have, always will.

"Many bikes don't contain nearly enough metal to trigger inductive loops on roadways. These sensors work by detecting eddy currents as you pass over them. You can make it easier for them to sense you a couple of different ways:

 - **Stop on the lines of the loop**: ~~Being in the center of the field is actually *less* effective.~~ The current runs in the lines, so the closer you are to those lines, the more eddy currents you generate. *As /u/jmputnam pointed out below, the current loops are mostly diagonal quadrupole which means a line runs through the center. As it turns out, being on the center is exactly where you want to be. Thank you sir!*  
 - **Don't use magnets - use conductive wire or plates**: Wrapping a loop of conductive wire either around your stanchions or around the bottom of the frame can help trigger more eddy currents. Keep in mind that eddy currents are generated when an inductive field passes through a conductor. Magnets have nothing to do with this (though a magnetic field IS created by the inductive loop, that's not what the sensor detects).  
 - **Try to make your conductive loop lateral to the inductive loop**: More eddy currents are generated by a conductive loop that runs parallel to the electric current in the inductive loops. If you took E&amp;M in college, you might remember the RHR? Basically you want your magnetic component to run counter to the magnetic component of the inductive loop to generate the most eddy currents. You can accomplish this by either making your conductive wire as horizontal as possible, or by leaning your bike over when you stop.

If someone finds them practical for some portion of their transportation needs--enough to get rid of a car or take fewer lyft/uber/car2go--then it seems like the cost is hardly a major impediment.

&gt; pointless toys

I'm not sure about that. I've talked, in person, to at least one person who enjoyed his commute (this guy was a geologist, IIRC, not tech).

"The headline is misleading. What he actually said, at the start of hour 2, is 

&gt;If the minimum wage had tracked the wages of the top 1%, today it'd be $28/hour. If the minimum wage had tracked the increases in productivity in our economy over the last 30 years, it'd be about $22/hour. As high as $15 sounds, my instinct is that you could push it up to $28 over time and the society would look a lot better than people think it would.

That is a lot different than proposing a $28 minimum wage.

UPDATE: here's what he said later in the show (about 10 minutes into hour 2) about paying his workers $9/hour:

&gt;It's a fair point, I don't pay $15 and yet I advocate for $15. Here's the thing, we cannot have a high functioning economy on the kindness of a few well-meaning CEOs. We need to solve the collective action problem. The truth is I don't care how big and how powerful and how profitable an individual company is, it is neither reasonable nor realistic to expect them to raise the wages of their employees way above the industry standard or above their competitors.

"It is funny how you are interpreting the treaties. Let me break it down for you.

&gt;At a certain point, we need to move on from the long distant past. . .and it was over a century ago.

Everybody likes to paint what happened as being so far away, nobody was around for it. That is straight up wrong.

We are not talking about some distant past in where our great-great-great-great-great-great grandfathers interacted. We're talking about the [forced, government sanctioned, sterilization of Native American women up into the 1970s.](https://cbhd.org/content/forced-sterilization-native-americans-late-twentieth-century-physician-cooperation-national-) We're talking about the [the removal of Indian children from their homes and subsequent banning of their culture,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Indian_boarding_schools) which occurred in Canada until 1996. And we are talking about the violation of the [Pickering Treaty of 1794](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Canandaigua) in the early 1960s that resulted in flooding of native lands and forcing them to sell their lands.

Perhaps the 60s and 70s were too long ago. There is currently a [tribe in Canada that is fighting private and government agencies from building a pipeline on their unceded land.](http://unistoten.camp/) And there are *many* more modern day examples of atrocities happening that can be found with a google search. My point is that all of the bad things you think happened forever ago still have lasting effects and in some cases, continue today. Do not sweep these things under the rug.

&gt;You know who also raped/murdered/slaughtered Native Americans? Other Native Americans. Shit happened, it was bad all around, and it was over a century ago.

You know what the Native Americans *didn't* do? Violate over 400 treaties, force white children to attend boarding schools to erase their culture and let some of them die, [create an insane asylum specifically for whites and sentences Indians for whatever reason and force them to live in horrendous conditions,](http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2011/11/04/hiawatha-asylum-insane-indians), commit a [number of massacres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Massacres_of_Native_Americans) in which many women and children were killed *outside* of a war context (and award medals in some cases to the soldiers who committed such massacres), sterilized white women against their will, [advising whites to eat grass](http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/200209/23_steilm_1862-m/part2.shtml) instead of providing rations for them on the reservations... We didn't do any of that.

Yeah, we did some horrible things too. Difference here is that we didn't commit them on the mass scale of the United States and it wasn't done in a *systematic* manner. We didn't continue the killings outside of war and we didn't impose measures against whites who lost to bring about the assimilation or destruction of their entire race. We didn't constantly violate treaties that were made in good faith. Just because we killed in defense or outright attacked someone out of aggression is **no justification** for what happened. And most importantly: we don't continue to do these things. Stop trying to level out the scales when they aren't even on the same playing field.

&gt;It's not PC - but various tribes have a lot of problems that they need to fix - and blaming the white man isn't the salve for all their wounds. Time to end preferential treatment given to people for something that happened far in the past.

You need to study federal Indian policy if you're going to comment on it. Native American tribes as sovereign nations is woven into the Constitution of the United States. We have our status today because *your* government that was and is chosen by *your* people have decided we are not just some other minority group to be stepped on without any kind of legalized standing. Fortunately not everyone in U.S. politics is a genocidal monster.

We do have a lot of problems we need to fix, some caused by ourselves, others caused by history and outside influences today. Eliminating our status as sovereign nations will not help the situation.

And learn that not all natives blame ""white people."" Chances are, if you're white, you haven't done shit to natives and that is fine. But the U.S. government continues to do bad things and I, personally, hold them accountable. Society as a whole gets some blame because they condone it to a degree.

And last, but not least, we were not ""given"" shit by those treaties. Concerning the treaties, only about a third of all the treaties signed were treaties of peace. Most were our agreeing to cede portions of our land in exchange for rights, services, and protection. What those treaties did were secure rights and protection for us because we wanted to avoid war in many cases.

The U.S. government has not given us these rights because they felt bad for us. They have never, ever said that. Rather, based on the trust relationship the U.S. government has with tribes, which is a government-to-government relationship, the U.S. follows some basic elements concerning its federal Indian policy. These elements have been established over time by various Supreme Court cases and legislation. One of those basic elements is the ""Reserved Rights Doctrine,"" in where tribal rights, which include the ability to self-govern, are not ""granted"" (or given) by the United States. They are reserved rights because tribes retain such rights as part of their status as prior and continuing sovereigns within the Americas. (Source: *Indian Tribes as Sovereign Governments - Second Edition* by Charles Wilkinson.)

Treaties are considered the law of the land by the U.S. Constitution. If you want to erase treaties, you are wanting to erase a fundamental element of your own country. These treaties were not made for some pitiful reason. It was because we were **and are** recognized as nations who deserve to be treated as such. That is why the treaties need to remain. The U.S. has an obligation to fulfill them (as stated by themselves, check out the BIA website) and neglecting to honor these treaties could very well result in the death and assimilation of more natives.

2) They're capturing all of the benefits (very loosely defined) of low density

It's selfish and foolish behavior. Why should I be penalized with higher rent/home prices because some 60 year old NIMBY doesn't want to deal with heightened density? These people (Esp.

"Why does Seattle have so many [5 point intersections](http://www.injurytriallawyer.com/practice_areas/five-times-more-dangerous-five-point-intersection-accidents.cfm)? 5-Way intersections are dangerous, inefficient, and essentially nullify any benefit of an intersection by requiring 5 separate right-of-ways. 

Some examples:

* Greenlake Five Points - Intersection of Washington 99 (Aurora Avenue) and North 83rd Street. 

* Greenlake Way Stone Way and N 50th

* NE 40th, 7th Ave NE

* Fremont Ave N, Fremont Way N, N 39th St

* Leary Ave NW, 20th Ave NW, NW Vernon Pl

EDIT:

&gt; However, when the Pacific Highway was built in the early 1930s, traffic engineers sliced through the existing residential grid so that motorists could get to Downtown faster. The new road was labeled Green Lake Way N and, like Bridge Way N ten blocks south, required tearing down existing homes to provide access to the new highway, now called SR-99

So, just terrible planning and design.

"And every day I see drivers turn and merge without signaling, speed, run through red lights when they're obviously going to miss the yellow, ignore bus/turn lane designations, try to turn across lanes of traffic, talking on their cell phones, blocking intersections, blindly backing up into traffic from a parking spot, failing to yield at intersections, and this is just the common stuff I literally see all day.

Bikes skip through red lights, roll through stop signs, follow cars ahead of them through all-way stops instead of waiting for a turn, and generally just ride wherever they want.

My point is that everyone commits traffic violations. Everyone. I don't believe there is a single person out there, driver or cyclist, who doesn't ever break any traffic laws at all. We do what we can get away with based on the situation at hand. We are all hypocrites when we bitch about each other.

Having said that, bikes and cars are nothing alike, despite being bound to the same general rules. In some cases, this makes a lot of sense. In others, it doesn't at all. The general sentiment from the cycling side is to treat red lights as stop signs, and stop signs as yield signs. The focus is shifted from properly adhering to the intersection's signal, to simply observing the correct right of way. 

The state of Idaho has had this policy as cyclist-specific traffic law since the 80s, and while it has plenty of opponents who believe it's best to treat a bike exactly the same as a car to have uniform traffic law, there's also plenty of data to show it's safer for everyone. There are a handful of other cities and counties that have enacted similar laws, and quite a few more where attempts to make this law have failed to pass.

Think about it though. Say you have a red light with a line of cars and a cyclist up front. There's zero cross-traffic. Let's disregard the legal side of things here for a second, and look at what's safest for the cyclist. 
Option 1 is the common one. Skipping through the light, getting up to speed with no traffic behind you, and being out of the way of the line of cars trying to get through the now green light intersection. 
Option 2 is the legal one. Wait for the green light, and then get up to speed with a line of cars right on your ass trying to accelerate faster than you can, any of whom could easily prioritize racing to the next red light over your life? 

I've seen this so many times, both with myself and many many other people. Bike isn't going fast enough for impatient driver, car rides it's ass, makes a ridiculously close and unsafe pass, brake checks bike, tries to run bike off the road, basically all things that could very, very easily kill the cyclist. These people exist, they're common, and the best way to avoid them is the assume everyone is one of them. 

From a cyclist perspective, cars equal death. What's safest isn't always totally compliant with laws designed for and around a completely different type of vehicle. Personally, when I'm out on the road on a bike, I care about staying alive a lot more than I care about making sure I don't break any traffic laws.

And just to address it, blindly blowing through a red light into cross traffic is, reckless, stupid, and a dick move. I make no defense for this whatsoever.

"Not sure where you got the impression that Solowheel ""seems to flirt with, if not engage in patent trollery."" [Solowheel](http://solowheel.com/) is the brand sold by [Inventist](http://www.inventist.com/), a small company owned by Shane Chen (who hails from Camas, WA btw). He invented the Solowheel in 2010. [Here's a good article from the Portland paper with his story](http://www.oregonlive.com/small-business/index.ssf/2013/05/with_solowheel_shane_chens_inv.html).

Unfortunately for Mr. Chen, China decided that his invention was awesome and proceeded to generate dozens of ripoffs (Airwheel, etc.) that have now flooded the market. [Here's a good article about that](http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-china-counterfeit-20150531-story.html). The same exact thing also happened with those ""hoverboard"" (I hate that name) 2-wheel balancing electric scooters. Chen invented that originally as well, as the [Hovertrax](http://www.solowheel.com/product/hovertrax/), then [China flooded the market with cheap copies](http://www.npr.org/2015/12/03/458361229/the-hoverboard-mystery-where-did-the-holidays-hot-product-come-from).

Also unfortunately for Mr. Chen, some of the more recent Solowheel ripoffs are not only considerably cheaper than Solowheel, but also perform better. Higher top speed, better range, etc.

Anyway, Chen and Inventist are not patent trolls by any definition of the term. He's just trying to protect sales of his actual invention against blatant copies. That's the *intended* use of patents.

-----

I don't have one, but I have followed the market for a while. To answer some of your specific questions:

- I haven't found any canonical place for info on these. There are a few forums that people discuss them on, but it is fairly arcane, as you say.

- Can't speak to the different models.

- You can purchase Solowheel on the [Inventist online store](http://store.inventist.com/store/catalog.aspx) or locally from [Solowheel Seattle](http://solowheelseattle.com/), run by ""Barefoot Ted"" up on Queen Anne.

- As someone else mentioned, one really great use case for these is ""last mile"" in conjunction with a bus or train. The small size makes it a lot easier to carry on and off the bus.

- Who the hell cares what kind of heckling you get riding? If it's fun and functional, that's all that matters.

- I don't know of an enthusiast group, but that guy Ted who runs the local distributor can probably hook you up if you get in touch with him.",,,,TheTim,"Tim Ellis, SeattleBubble.com &amp; Ellis.FYI",,1463077588,t5_2qhad,t3_4j1tk6,t3_4j1tk6,33,1465811175,0,0,d32zy0d,Seattle,33,,flair verified

"Oh this shit again.

When it comes to the minimum wage debate and the political conservatives who desperately glum onto anything to support their overly-simplistic, preconceived economic ideas, a key point gets overlooked.

Suppose that lower wages does mean more jobs.  It doesn't, but let's give it to 'em cause we're nice like that.

Then more jobs means that more people are employed at those lower wages.  In other words, we have more working people living at or below poverty; some of whom will require government assistance in order to eat, feed their families, maintain a roof over their heads, etc.

In other *other* words, exactly what we've got now.  What we've been doing for decades.  Where taxpayers are subsidizing the workforces of low-wage employers such as Wal-Mart and fast food.

&gt;Q7. What questions can a covered entity's employees ask to determine if a dog is a service animal?

&gt;&gt;A. In situations where it is not obvious that the dog is a service animal, staff may ask only two specific questions: (1) is the dog a service animal required because of a disability? and (2) what work or task has the dog been trained to perform? Staff are not allowed to request any documentation for the dog, require that the dog demonstrate its task, or inquire about the nature of the person's disability.

"No competent linguist on earth would take that statement seriously. What, did you think the rest of our language was voted in by some kind of formal council or something? 

This is exactly how new words get invented: someone sees a linguistic need (however tiny) and fulfills it with the other bits and pieces available. Whoever coined this word took a perfectly valid word and a perfectly valid suffix and combined them using perfectly valid means, and your peevishness does nothing to invalidate that process. 

You know what makes something a ""real word?"" People using it. End of story. (And here's a TED talk from a real linguist to back my opinion up: https://www.ted.com/talks/anne_curzan_what_makes_a_word_real/transcript?language=en ) 

If there *is* an authority on what constitutes a ""real"" word and what doesn't, it's a lexicographer, not a random dude with a chip on his shoulder and a neophobic streak. But there isn't, and unless the English gets an equivalent to the [Académie française](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acad%C3%A9mie_fran%C3%A7aise), there never will be. 

(Also, FFS, if you've really got to be a grammar prude, at least spellcheck.

"I love your attitude. A lot of folks here are hating on the timelines, even now that the new ones are better across-the-board. We should know by now that even moderate-sized transit projects can take a decade -- and this is an absolutely enormous project, one of the largest in NW history. And ST has a track record for delivering on time, which is miraculous in the infrastructure world. A tighter timeline would inevitably get delayed, and either way Reddit's pet Ballard light rail comes in the 2030s. Infrastructure ain't easy. Plus, as the system slowly grows over the next two decades, gridlock will ease up and those of us stuck in cars and buses will benefit, too.

I'd like everyone here to honestly ask themself: do you want transit because you care about Seattle? If you just want your commute right now to be shorter, and you vote NO because half a generation will pass before you get light rail walking distance from your house, then you're really just looking out for yourself. These projects take the whole community to move forward, and we've got an agency who clearly is listening to us and has earned our trust with the Cap Hill and UW line.

"Getting to and from Expedia campus is going to be a major challenge. It's in a geographically isolated area and the nearest east-west arterials connecting 15th/Elliott Ave to I-5 are 45th and Mercer. Neither of those roads can handle any more vehicles during about half the day. Sending more cars and especially transit down either of them is crazy. But that's what Expedia's move will require. Frankly, it's difficult to say what, if anything, can be done.

Perhaps this is a really great time to start making more noise and remind our leaders this problem is urgent. We don't need any more year-long studies of mobility; we need action. (Ironically, a mobility study on Expedia's impacts to traffic might be warranted.) Seattle needs to get serious about prioritizing transit and non-SOV-based modes of transportation based on the dozens of studies we already have. For example, 3rd Ave, the main bus corridor in the Downtown, still allows cars and lacks seriously enforced connections to city and regional roads. Or RapidRide D still has to fight cars along most of its route. Or zero transit priority on Denny despite carrying tens of thousands of riders per day. Or the 2017 timeline for extending the 2nd Ave bike lane to a *safe* terminus. Even with the clear victory of Move Seattle, Prop 1 (more Metro funding), and concerns over ST3's timeline; a visible urgency is lacking.

"He owns the damn company. He forced himself out of his own job in order to avoid destroying his own business. I'm not saying that to belittle his apology, which appears to be completely sincere; just to point out that nobody is forcing anybody to do anything, he's reacting to the fact that people were about to start voting with their dollars and refusing to eat his burgers, which would have screwed all the people who work for him. Instead of letting that happen, he did the honorable thing, took responsibility for his own opinions, and separated himself personally from the business so that others wouldn't have to pay the price for his mistake.

Everything is working as it should: he continues to own his business, but now has to go off and re-evaluate his life before sticking himself back in the public eye. Perhaps he will become a better person for it. His family and employees don't have to suffer. Nobody who likes Red Mill burgers has to stop eating them.

So long ago, I am sure its not on the website, but it might be. The general slant of the article was how awfully racist this particular program was.

But that isn't the interesting part of this story - that came a couple of issues later, in the Letters to the Editor section.  Letters from former students, African American, who were members of said program.  The Stranger got it wrong, these people claimed: the teachers at their school were the most supportive people they had ever had in their lives. The real problem came from the almost unbearable peer pressure from fellow students to not work so hard, to not take school work seriously, that it was a waste of time.

"The port was citing a study, non-peer-reviewed, that the Port itself provided.  Outside of this argument, the report really has little value because the Port specifically created the document to help fuel its arguments.


What then came out immediately following the vote was that the Port was eyeballing the Hansen properties for its own building expansion.  So in a funny way without saying directly, the Port was correct - Hansen's building would cost jobs - but they weren't Port shipping jobs, they were jobs developing and building the property that the Port wanted to own, that Hansen swooped in and bought up, and that now the Port thinks it can get a sweet deal buying off of Hansen.

"I'm not hating on you. I'm stating simple facts.

No matter how ""tame"" it is, it is not domesticated. Strange people, loud noises, unfamiliar scents, and being out of its territory in broad daylight are a recipe for disaster when it comes to wild - and that is non-domesticated, which means exotic - animals.

I'm asking you to consider the animal's safety before you consider your own fun. That law enforcement will kill the animal before capturing it is something you really want to risk? Even with a collar, a leash, and a little bow attached?

I'm sure it's leash trained. I'm sure it does well in its home territory. But you said your sister is visiting, and this is bound to be stressful for the animal.

Stressed cats react by attacking irritating stimulus.

Ocelots are wild animals and their behavior cannot be reliably predicted.

Like I said, I know you're not stupid, so don't be stupid.

EDIT: And I'd like to make it clear also that I 100% believe the ocelot is a precious rubby baby and a sweet kitten -- in its home territory, where it feels safe enough to open up. Small wild cats are natural climbers and hiders; if you bring a small exotic cat out of its territory, into broad daylight, surrounded by unfamiliar sights and smells, with people being loud all around it, it's not going to be comfortable for the animal! I'd love to see more gentle, happy exotic cats being shown off to people in public, but sadly, it's simply not the typical reaction.

Again, if you do it anyways, you need to make sure the cat is comfortable. If you are determined, then you should bring a small dark crate that the cat has shown willingness to hide inside of before. Animals backed into corners and surrounded by predators (such as unfamiliar people) are not safe to be around. Don't make your cat want to bolt, strike out, or run and hide, and if it does want to run and hide, give it somewhere safe to retreat to.

I just don't want to see the cat hurt, dude. I don't want to read about you guys on the news and see the ocelot was harmed, or someone else was harmed. You have to consider that any exotic cat is a spokesmeow for EVERY exotic cat, and that includes servals, bobcats, savannah cats, etc. If something goes wrong, lawmakers will notice. Ocelots aren't on best terms with ownership in WA, and if something happens, the laws may get tightened and some exotic cats may lose their homes and have to be surrendered. You have to realize that your sister's cat is an ambassador, and you have to be so, so careful both that it doesn't get hurt, and that it doesn't cause a scene and cause important people to think it's unsafe to have exotic pets.",,,,valerianmenthol,Snohomish County,,1463188371,t5_2qhad,t3_4j8dv2,t1_d34qitl,126,1465841776,0,0,d34s34p,Seattle,126,,flair

"I'm a bartender and this came up yesterday.

[WA State law](http://www.wla.org/assets/WALE/2015WALEConference/Service%20Animals%20and%20the%20Washington%20Law%20Against%20Discrimination.pdf) recognizes two types of service animals that are allowed in food-related spaces (restaurants/groceries):

&gt;The types of service animals that must be admitted to food establishments are limited to:

&gt;1. Miniature horses that have been individually trained to do work or perform tasks for the
benefit of a person with a disability.
&gt;
&gt;2. Dogs that have been individually trained to do work or perform tasks for the benefit of an
individual with a disability.  

No other types of animal.

The ONLY things you're allowed to ask about a dog that someone brings into the establishment: **""Is it a pet?"" ""What has your dog been trained to do?""** 

State law emphasizes the dog have training and have some specific task(s) they do. Something like 'alert on medical emergency', 'act in reaction to my state',  or 'provide physical stability' are totally legal and within bounds. Things like 'companionship' or 'emotional support' are not (note the intangible qualities), and the business should ask the animal be kept outside.

You are not allowed to ask the person about their condition and there is no need for them to disclose that. However, if they cannot articulate a trained task that the dog performs, they are not following the law and cannot expect to bring the dog in with them. 

Also, if the dog misbehaves (repeated barking not related to work task, urinates/defecates, wanders off) then they can be asked to leave as well.  ",,,,retrojoe,Central Area,,1462824473,t5_2qhad,t3_4il085,t3_4il085,24,1465742520,0,0,d2z0jw2,Seattle,24,,flair

&gt;You know what I hate most about New Seattle? All these goddamn buildings. Fucking capitalism, you know? This parking lot at Summit and Howell is the perfect antidote to all that shiny, techy bullshit. It's surrounded by a pale salmon-colored wall (quirky!), and it's half-empty most of the time (like the good old days!). Inside, one wall reads in huge, Helvetica letters ""NO TRESPASSING.""

Another is just a ride to another city:

&gt;Amtrak to Portland
303 S Jackson St

&gt;I will admit that I stopped using Amtrak for trips to Portland and have switched to BoltBus, which is much cheaper. But the train is by far the most comfortable and romantic way to make this journey. Nothing beats a train when it comes to ground transportation. A bus is still on the road, and roads have no magic whatsoever (particularly the main one to Portland). Cutting costs always comes at a price. In the case of using BoltBus instead of Amtrak, the price is your daydreams. You always arrive in Portland with daydreams that are much poorer than the ones you would have had if you'd taken the train. I-5 is not for the lovers of dreams. CHARLES MUDEDE

**I get it - /r/Seattle thinks that institutionalized racism doesn't exist an that racialized inequality doesn't matter.**

Sure. What is your point? This ignores the racial divide in income. 

When poverty is racially concentrated, policies that disproportionately affect poor people cut across racially segregated lines.

Seattle and WA have the most anti-poor, regressive tax system in the nation, is seeing both increasing inequality and poverty, and has some of the nation's worst racial inequality.

Thus, Seattle and WA's inability to implement progressive tax and fund policies disproportionately affect certain minorities, and reinforce racial inequality and segregation.

"A girl answers a similar ad, meets the guy, has a few drinks, makes a porn, and consents to everything that happens.  She leaves and goes on with her life.  Is there anything to blame her for in this scenario?  No, because without a transgression/crime, there is no blame.  The only difference between this girl, and the girls this post is about is circumstance.  
The girls posted about are no different than the girl in my hypothetical, and deserve the same amount of blame.  Moreover, blaming the victim inherently takes away blame from the perp, which is wrong-headed.   Is he any better than a guy who rapes an unsuspecting bystander?  Victim blaming discourages victims from coming forward, reduces the guilt of the perp, and often has sexist overtones.  So yes, this is victim blaming, and if you entertain it you are juggling knives.",,,,didntstopgotitgotit,,,1463635036,t5_2qhad,t3_4k0c6a,t1_d3b8tg6,33,1465953665,0,0,d3b9fq8,Seattle,33,,

"&gt; In fact, of course, new people will move to Seattle whether we build for them or not. The only thing we have control over—unless we decide to build a wall—is whether we're prepared for those new residents.

This is the crux of the issue here, and by being stubborn and attempting to stop all development you end up falling into the same trap that the bay area did.

Seattle's economy is booming. People are moving here by the hundreds/thousands every month. And it's not *only* the tech sector that is booming. Even the most recent financial crisis hardly slowed Seattle's growth or real estate/rental market. Barring some seriously catastrophic economic turn of events, that's just not going to stop any time soon.

So either you can accept that the city is growing rapidly and we need to plan and compromise on how to best develop it to effectively house, transport, and sustain the population, or you can dig your feet in screaming ""no, no, no!"" and do nothing to further the conversation while those with means outbid you for rent/housing/development through the existing laws and accelerate the transformation into SF 2.0.",,,,GuinnessDraught,,,1462383256,t5_2qhad,t3_4hvi3w,t3_4hvi3w,110,1465633206,0,0,d2sohg2,Seattle,110,,

"I'm a driver and heard the conversation. It was another driver. The complaint was his radio never switched over to tunnel mode. Multiple coordinators controlled large group of buses. When you enter the tunnel you are under a different set of coordinators controlling just the tunnel. They also control the trains. This is a different system of radio, it's more of an open-air radio system where you can hear everything being broadcasted and when you need to say something you wait for open-air and then speak. 

I'm still considered a rookie bus driver doing this for only two years. I've never driven through the tunnel on a live route but I am qualified to do so. I understand how to switch the radio over to Tunnel mode. Now here comes the fun part I have no idea how to spam the entire metro Fleet. I've tried to figure out multiple times how someone would be able to do that. My guess is that his radio somehow glitched out and spam the entire fleet simple as that.

"&gt; Calling a speaker who is making political comment ""sexist"" is just another kind of ad hominem

It is *not* ad hominem. That's a logical fallacy, which would require /u/Cadoc7 to explicitly say that their opinion of the vote was *incorrect because of their sexist comments*. He simply said the behavior was unacceptable, which is not a comment on their position or a justification for why it's incorrect.

Separating the two is precisely the correct way to handle it: the validity of a statement on the vote is unrelated to the sexist comments in that commentary. If he *wasn't* separating the two, and instead argued that their opinion of the vote was incorrect because of their sexist comments, then *THAT* would be the very definition of ad hominem.

&gt;argumentum ad hominem, is a logical fallacy in which an argument is rebutted by attacking the character, motive, or other attribute of the person making the argument, or persons associated with the argument, rather than attacking the substance of the argument itself.

"Hey, I'm from Little Rock and moved to Seattle a few years ago.  I'd say that $65k total household income is do-able if you live frugally.  What city are you in now?

A few things to consider:

* Seattle is so much safer than the cities in Arkansas that it was kind of disorienting at first.  Single women walk alone downtown at all hours of the night and make it home okay.  People pull out high-tech gadgets late at night after going to bars and clubs.  Seattle does have crime, and property crime is worse here, but violent crime is very low.  Some parts of town are worse than others, but there are no neighborhoods where it's simply unsafe to be there at any time of day.  I found it useful to compare crime stats here with where I was living to gauge which neighborhoods were safe.
* Traffic in Seattle can be truly awful.  Don't be deceived by the fact that Everett is only 30 miles away.  That's not generally considered a reasonable commute- we're talking about 1.5-2+ hours one way in traffic when things get really bad.  Also, free parking is very limited- people pay hundreds of dollars a month for parking spaces downtown.  Don't assume that your employer will provide free parking.
* The good news is that transit here isn't awful.  Normal people, people with good jobs who shower daily, ride the bus.  My boss has a bus pass, as does my VP.  You'll hear people complain about buses being late, and they're far from perfect, but they're miles ahead of anything you've seen in Arkansas.  As a consequence, living near a bus stop or, even better, a transit center, is considered a very good thing.  You'll notice that homes near bus stops cost a little more.  That's because they really help your commute.  Since your wife will be a student, check out Google Maps and see what her trip to school would be like.  Colleges in Seattle tend to be transit hubs, so it's likely she won't need to drive.  If you can find a good way for you or your wife to ride transit to work/school I'd seriously consider ditching one of the cars.  You'd still have one if you want to get out of the city and it will free up quite a bit of your budget to not have a second car payment.
* Your job prospects here will likely be much better, but there is also tremendous wealth in the area.  No matter how much you make, someone out there will make more.  You'll notice the people with lakefront homes, boats, luxury cars, etc.  Even if you're doing okay it can make you feel poor by comparison.  There are also people living on the streets with nothing.  Wealth inequality is both higher and much more apparent.  That bothers some people more than others, just know that it's probably different than what you're used to.
* Rent is high, and so are home prices.  Normal, middle-class people are often priced out of buying a home anywhere near the city.  If your dream is to own a home, know that it will be difficult to find something in a reasonable price range.  It's very normal for an adult with a good job and a family to rent here.  
* Renting a home from across the country is more difficult.  There's a huge demand for places in the city, so many smaller rentals don't even bother to list open apartments online- they just put a sign out and know that they'll have the place filled within a couple of weeks, tops.  There are also scammers out there- don't hand over a payment to an individual until they can unlock the door for you.  Be wary of wire transfers or people who demand cash.  Lots of people moving here for the first time find larger management companies easier to deal with, but smaller landlords will usually offer better deals.  Be ready to write a check for an application fee (usually $20-50) on the spot if you really like a place.  Remember that you can always sign a 1-year lease and then look for something better/less expensive once you've been here a while.

Let me know if you have any questions, and feel free to PM me.  I wish I had been able to move here when I was your age.  :)

"Personal anecdote:

I went to a private high school, and when I was a freshman one of the required courses was called ""Society and Justice"". It's purpose was to open student's eyes to the less fortunate, and educate them on the social injustices that plague portions of the US (and global) population.

Our teacher (who was also a priest), asked a homeless gentleman that he'd met while volunteering at a local soup kitchen to come in and address our class. I'm sure he was hoping that hearing this guy's personal story would help put a human face on homelessness. 

This guy proceeded to tell us that he was homeless by choice. That he lived in a tent under a bridge because he liked camping. That he made more money panhandling then working a job, and didn't have to pay taxes on his income. That he had been married once, and had a few kids that lived with their mother in California and didn't get to see them very often because he didn't have a car but that was ok.

The problem is multidimensional, both within schools and at home. Seattle's schools are [heavily segregated](http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/education/the-resegregation-of-seattles-schools/), with grossly unequal funding across schools. 

Seattle and King Co. have the most regressive, anti-poor tax scheme in the nation. Per-pupil spending is well below the national average. Our schools were so underfunded they were in violation of the state constitution.

So long as middle and low-income families are [continually uprooted and displaced](http://crosscut.com/2010/11/how-seattle-is-exporting-poor-people/) from their homes, so long as middle income jobs are vanishing, so long as public goods and services are underfunded due to our regressive taxes, equal educational attainment will be an uphill battle.

"I notice that he conveniently chooses not to mention the option of building (nearly) all the parking above ground, as some of the large new towers I've seen going up do.  

And his bit about ""the area surrounding your building has vast, untapped reservoirs of parking: surface lots at grocery stores and movie theaters, underground spaces at shopping complexes and office buildings, and idle spots at nearby apartments"".  As if somehow that magically works to ""borrow"" the parking someone else paid for and to preempt its intended use won't result in a backlash when it's not making the local parking situation a clusterfark.

I get it.  If a developer didn't have to provide any parking, they could turn that space into more units to rent and make more profit.  But that doesn't give a flip to anyone who might actually need a car while living there - just make it someone else's problem is not the answer.

5) Major corporate sponsor remains upset at spending large amount of money on sponsorship and having it blow up in their face.

What made me finally okay with giving up my car was realizing that I could pull out my phone and call an Uber any time, day or night, and have it pick me up and take me home pretty inexpensively.  I rarely need it, but it's nice to know I'll never be stuck.  I highly recommend checking it out when you get here.  Plus, it's pretty awesome to sit in the back with your SO on ""date night"" instead of fuming at traffic.


Whether or not you drive in the city, you'll notice that biking is a thing here.  We have crazy bike messenger types who laugh at our silly laws and limitations, super-safe dads with kids riding in cargo trailers (both dad and kid wearing helmets, of course), and everyone in between.  Cyclists generally aren't crazy, and are just trying to get to wherever they're going.  But when you get too close it's like walking up to a guy mid-workout and threatening him.  They'll get angry if you put them in danger.  Give them plenty of space and you'll be fine.


/u/zax9 has some good points about the culture.  The winter darkness here can really get to newcomers, and summer days seem to go on forever.  We have very temperate weather, so sometimes it's easy to forget how far north we are.  In the month of June the sun comes up by 5:15am and doesn't set until after 9pm.  In December the sun isn't up until about 7:45am and sets before 4:30pm.  If you work standard hours, you'll likely go several days without being outdoors when the sun is up.  Some people buy sun lamps, others spend a week in Hawaii or Mexico, and some of us actually enjoy the lack of sun.


Another note about the culture- Seattle is very socially liberal.  For someone like me who didn't really ""fit"" in Arkansas, it's the best thing ever.  But if you're really socially conservative it may be uncomfortable.  Washington as a whole seems to tend towards libertarianism- as long as you mind your own business no one cares what you do (thus our support of same-sex marriage and marijuana legalization), and Seattle just elected a Socialist to the city council.  There are plenty of churches here of many denominations, but there's also a higher proportion of atheists.  I've yet to be asked if I've ""found a church home"".

"You seem to be one of those people who has seen too many tv shows that portray childbirth as an urgent situation.  **it isn't**.  Even broken water is typically followed by at least 6-12 hours of gradually increasing labor, only the final stage of which actually involves being on a table having the baby yanked out.  If there is an actual urgent situation relating to the pregnancy (as in, something abnormal), 911 and an ambulance is by far the best bet not only for public safety but also the health of the patients due to immediacy of first responders providing care much faster than driving your car and hoisting the patient into the ER and shouting for triage.

This does not excuse putting holes in the walls, stains on the walls, repainting the unit a different color, grease from cooking coating the walls, or pet or smoke damage.

"Ugh...Erica C. Barnett at it again. First she's patting herself on the back for having her ""article"" (read: gossip blog) posted in The Atlantic, and now she has to eat crow after the publication issued a correction because the piece included false accusations based on an anecdotal comment from Councilwoman Sally Bagshaw that she didn't bother to verify. [AND she's blaming her own ineffectiveness as a ""journalist"" on Bagshaw:](https://thecisforcrank.com/2016/05/24/atlantic-correction/)

&gt;I wrote this anecdote based on Bagshaw’s recollection, in which she told me the story I described in the piece. In retrospect, although this was an anecdote (and not, as many seem to think, the subject of the story), I should have asked Ron and Don to verify or deny Bagshaw’s account. I did not do so because I consider Bagshaw, whom I have covered for many years on other subjects, a reliable source, and still do. Because this story was about the misogyny about council members, not Ron and Don, I took her at her word on this anecdote and I regret that I did not call them to verify. (Like other reporters, I also didn’t individually contact the authors of all the tweets, Facebook posts, and emails, nor the people who called and left nasty messages at Bagshaw’s office. Instead, I took her and all the other council members at their word about their own experiences.) Bagshaw now says that they gave her phone number out on an unrelated occasion after being interviewed on another show about homelessness.  I will be reviewing the tapes to verify this.

The problem Ms. Barnett doesn't seem to recognize is that her presentation of this ""anecdote"" suggested that the radio hosts ENCOURAGED the misogynistic behavior directed at Bagshaw and other members of the council, which they categorically did not. And she's dismissive of her error, saying that she ""and other journalists"" also didn't bother to contact the authors of various offending tweets and Facebook posts...which is ridiculous because the tweets and posts themselves are not anecdotal, and are verifiable simply by the fact that they exist. 

Erica is either a journalist or a gossip blogger- not both. And by this account (and let's face it, every other ""article"" I've seen her name attached to), I'm convinced she is the latter.

2.  Money.  Every available cent in the public budget has 100 other projects with their own champions and spheres of influence.  All of them competing for the same money that would be used for a homeless reduction program.

3.  The homeless themselves are hard to help.  The temporarily disenfranchised or those caught up in the correctional system nightmare in our country, those are simple to help.

"DO

NOT

BRING

YOUR

WILD ANIMAL

INTO

PUBLIC

SPACES

Not on a leash. Not in a crate. Not for fun. Not for emergencies.

If it gets loose, it WILL be killed by law enforcement because it is a WILD ANIMAL.

Ocelots are not tame and can never be, no matter how much you love them and dote on them. They are wild, and they WILL act like it. They are unpredictable. If someone is injured, your animal will be put down.

The number one rule of keeping exotics is not to trust them. All wild carnivores have prey drive. Small things (animals, children, hands) are not safe around them, especially in stressful environments (such as broad daylight, surrounded by strangers and traffic). Ocelots are nocturnal, territorial, and carnivorous.

Is it worth your animal's life just for the fun instagram opportunity?

Don't be stupid. And I know you're not stupid, so don't do it. Consider the animal's happiness. As owners we have an obligation to put their needs before our amusement. The endless ""what ifs"" involved in this consideration should be enough to clue you in that it's not a very good idea. So many things could go wrong, since the animal is not domesticated no matter how ""tame"" it is. Don't risk it.

And if you do risk it, I advise contacting the owner of whatever business you do settle on before you go, so you can ask them personally and make reservations and arrangements. Since I have the feeling you're going to do it anyways.

EDIT: thx for votez i know its a troll now. but still, something to think about: dumb people from out of state might try this. ocelots are small exotic cats, and there's a serval &amp; savannah cat craze going on, and they're just as unsuitable as pets. but people do it anyways! because it's ""cool"". thankfully most owners are more responsible than dumb relatives of friends of family who might be sincere in their questions on the sub.",,,,valerianmenthol,Snohomish County,,1463185051,t5_2qhad,t3_4j8dv2,t3_4j8dv2,479,1465840886,0,0,d34q74z,Seattle,479,,flair

"The quote is ""you could see she had blood coming out of her eyes. Blood coming out of her whatever""

Other quotes are much older like the 1991 Esquire quote ""you know, it doesn't really matter what [the media] writes as long as you've got a young and beautiful piece of ass""

Or in his 1997 book ""The Art of the Comeback"": ""women have one of the greatest acts of all time. The smart ones act very feminine and needy, but inside they are real killers...I have seen women manipulate men with just a twitch of their eye- or perhaps another body part""


He quoted a tweet in April of 2015 saying """"@mplefty67: if Hillary Clinton can't satisfy her husband what makes her think she can satisfy America?""..."", but then he deleted the tweet


In 2006 in an interview with Larry king he said ""[Angelina Jolie's] been with so many guys she makes me look like a baby..."". I don't fully get this one.

"I don't know if this article is true but I can confirm that the owner is an asshole so I could see him making these comments. I have told this story here and I will tell it again.

Many years ago I was living out of the country in a place that didn't really have any hamburgers. I was gone for a year and a half and I was constantly thinking about going to Redmill to get  a real Bacon burger and Onions rings. I couldn't wait to get back so I could go there. All I wanted was a fucking burger and onion rings
When I got back that was one of the first places I went.. I went in the middle of the day so there were only a few people ahead of me in line. The owner was behind the counter doing some cleaning. I had forgotten that they didn't take cards there and so I opened my wallet and realised I didn't have any cash.

 I wasn't going to let that stop me so I left to go find a cash machine and come back. I walked around the side of the building and the owner came out of the side door and told me "" There is no free lunch""
I couldn't believe it. His comment was completely unprovoked. I didn't bitch about them not taking cards( Why do they still not take cards). I didn't complain about the prices? I was craving it so much I would have gladly paid double. 
He went out of his way to be an asshole to someone who didn't have money. I don't understand the thought process that lead to him thinking that was an appropriate response.

So fuck Redmill and fuck that guy.

I work in the SLU and am well aware of the tracks.  However, the subject section of tracks come into the lane of travel from the left and narrow to about one ft. of space between the curb and the track - so, if for instance, you are riding in the right side of the right lane like you're supposed to, at night, you cannot see the tracks enter your lane and run parallel to you, with only one ft. of space for riding.

"I think if you allow the division of those lots in red on your diagram than the developer that buys them will build the max height building allowed, to the edge of the new boundary.  Much like what is happening south of 65th st. in Ballard.  They won't build houses that look like houses there, is all I'm saying.  They'll build the box looking new townhome type buildings that they're building everywhere.  I don't know if that's good or bad, I have mixed feelings on the design, but it definitely changes the character of the neighborhood.  Cities change though, and that's not going to stop no matter what we do.

Also because the houses built will be sold for somewhere north of 650K, the demographic shift that may or may not occur changes the feeling of the neighborhood as well.  I don't know where exactly you live so I don't know if all the houses around there are already very expensive or not.

"I have no facts to back up these claims, but there were always rumors that he was getting hundreds of thousands of dollars from boosters. These boosters are smart and more than likely were filtering this money through these camps. Very similar to how a certain presidential candidate gets paid ridiculous amounts for speaking fees. 

Also if you never heard, there were some serious allegations of the team and boosters recruiting players, providing housing and also paying for players to go to a private HS. The HS supposedly was super easy on the players so they could be eligible to play football. The district claims that this isn't why they fired him, but there has to be some pressure to take action.

I went to a nearby HS(we weren't rivals at the time) and we were always curious about where certain players were coming from. Generally the area where Bellevue HS feeds is very white and there seemed to be more black players than one would expect. All of this is speculation, but should provide you with more info about why he's going to be fired.

edit: Here's some links to the previous findings(not the districts BS internal investigation). I personally think Bellevue SD wanted to find a way to fire him without the district getting in trouble.

"1. Do not use a flashing front light at night, they're illegal in WA and decrease your safety

2. When locking your bike do a ""Sheldon Brown"" or modified Sheldon brown lock - your rear wheel is the most expensive wheel to replace. http://www.802bikeguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/modified_sheldon_brown_lock_strategy.jpg

3. Don't ride close to the right hand side of lanes, either take the lane or ride far enough from the parked cars that you could feasibly dodge a door - cars should have to cross into the other lane to pass you, if you're not forcing them to do that you're asking to get buzzed. 

4. Don't sit at a red light late at night - if it's clear, run it. Sitting at  red light any time where people are getting out of bars is an invitation to get rear ended/hit. 

5. Fatter tires are your friends. 23s are painful for the city, 25s are better, 28s are awesome for city riding (but if your bike has clearance - going larger is better!)

6. Get slicks. Treaded tires are shitty for traction in the rain, you want a smooth or ""slick"" tire with no or minimal treading. 

7. Fenders are your friends. 

8. Wool is your friend in winter/rain

9. Your voice is useful - if a driver is doing something that could hurt you, use your loudest voice to call their attention to you.

"I know exactly how difficult this is.  I'm a disabled vet and despite owning my own successful business that easily handles my income needs to pay the rent, I have had a ridiculously difficult time finding a place to live with my family in the past.  This wasn't a major issue before I degraded to the point of needing a cane to walk, but once I did, I began seeing this.

My previous landlord freaked out on me halfway through a lease, wanting to double the rent and other odd changes.  When we objected because we were in the middle of a *lease*, she started coming in at odd hours and even stealing things.  I set up video and captured her walking around the house nude, setting the heat ridiculously low, and even taking small electronics.  She also began spreading nuts around our kitchen, placing our severely nut-allergic child at extreme risk.  We had to have him and his mother move out temporarily and began looking for another place to live.

In the course of looking, it was absurdly difficult to find anything.  I finally lucked into a referral to a place run by a local non-profit aimed specifically at families.  While our income wasn't low enough to qualify, the fact I am disabled combined with the extreme situation did.  I spent several hundred dollars on various application fees before finding this place, yet not a single one approved us.  When we asked for reasons, we got unspecified things like ""we rented to someone else"" and such.  Two complex managers actually verbally told me it was because their boss had seen my cane and assumed I would have unstable income as a result, but wouldn't put that in writing for obvious reasons.  This despite the fact that I have a 16 year history of my business, including riding out the last 2 major crashes.

It's absurd, in fact, that this is the case.  Not everyone who is disabled is a low-income tenant.  Not everyone who is low income is a bad tenant.  In fact, the current landlord I have specializes primarily in low income tenants and they have very few bad ones in general!  This crap has to change, somehow.  I'm not nearly an expert in how that could be done but having seen the impact of it personally and for no other reason than I walk with a cane.

"Wow, that was the complete opposite of my experience.

The cop didn't give me a case number, and I found out how important that was as soon as I called my insurance.  They called me a few days later saying my car was found in some guys front yard, it looks driveable, and I'm free to pick it up. ""Great!"" I think. 

I get to the house, and my car is crashed into a tree and completely stripped.  It has no seats, no steering wheel, no headlights, and the wheels have been replaced with steelies. The cops were nowhere to be found. What the FUCK.  I had no idea what to do.  It was 9pm and dark.  I called the non-emergency line to ask what the correct course of action was.  I don't even know if the people who live in the house had any contact with the police or know what happened.

I end up knocking on the door of the house and thank goodness they were really nice people.  I was expecting a confrontation into who was going to pay to fix the tree and the yard. But I just paid to have it towed to an impound lot and insurance took care of the rest.

"Opening Day is a long time Seattle anchor event  probably been going on for 50 + years.  It's multifaceted boating event. First, it's a UW Crew invitational where bunches of crews - local, US and international - race from the east end of the Montlake cut to the finish on the west end; right where Portage bay starts.  If you don't follow it, the UW crew - men and women's - has been an international contender for decades (note to self: read Boys in the Boat) and this is their chance to show off on their home waters. Combined with the crew races, the Seattle Yacht Club hosts a boat parade that starts in Portage bay after the races and proceeds east through the cut into Lake Washington.  Yacht clubs from as far away as Canada bring boats to run in the parade.  The parade is traditionally started and end by a Seattle Fire boat spraying water from their fire fighting cannon for a really spectacular show.

As part to the event, a log boom is setup on the east side of the cut where local boaters can tie up and enjoy the races and the parade.  Bigger boats - those with overnight abilities - will tie up Friday and make a 3 day party of it.  If the weather is good - like this year - you get a lot of small boats that show up for the day to enjoy the party.

If you can get there, it's quite the boat show and is a lot of fun.  You can always watch the crew races and the parade from the sides of the Montlake cut - no boat required.  Wanna be a true Seattleite?  Then it's definitely something you make a point to experience.

"I don't see the point in using public money for private stadiums. The economic impact from stadiums is overblown: [Last Week Tonight] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcwJt4bcnXs

&gt; There are a lot of things economists disagree about, but the economic impact of sports stadiums isn't one of them.

&gt; “If you ever had a consensus in economics, this would be it,"" says Michael Leeds, a sports economist at Temple University.  ""There is no impact.""

&gt; Leeds studied Chicago – as big a sports town as there is, with five major teams.

&gt; “If every sports team in Chicago were to suddenly disappear, the impact on the Chicago economy would be a fraction of 1 percent,” Leeds says. **“A baseball team has about the same impact on a community as a midsize department store.”**

"So funny story here for you - 

I was training for a triathlon last year, mostly in a local pool. I had ordered a wet-suit for the race per requirements (and obviously they help a lot with buoyancy/speed). Late last spring, around this time, there was a really nice Saturday, so me and a friend who was also doing the triathlon decided, ""Hey let's head down to Matthews Beach and train there!"" 

We get down to the beach, tons of people out in the sun, but nobody really swimming, save perhaps a few kids in the shallow areas pitter pattering around. 

We're putting on our suits thinking how cool we'll look swimming out there. Some lady even comes up to us and asks us if we were planning on swimming across the lake...?

Regardless, we get going and as we're walking out a bit further it quickly hits us both that this isn't going to last very long as our feet, hands and face were FREEZING the minute we dunked. We both swam about half a lap trying to tough it out, only to both concede at the same time that, no, this wasn't going to happen.

We shamefully come out of the water only to have someone yell, ""well that didn't last very long!"" as we gathered our things and left...

Also we have way too many companies running a bunch of different transit systems. They are not cohesive and are competing with each other.

"""Privilege"" as a term has been ruined by assholes, but don't let that get in the way of understanding what the actual point of the theory is: to understand social systems. Anyone who makes it about individuals is applying an individualistic lens (very popular ideology these days) to a theory that breaks when you stop looking at the bigger picture.

It's very useful to know how power/resources flow in society, how people get what they get, and how people can change society. The most insidious part of corrupt social systems is that *individuals making personal choice cannot change them*. Only mass movements can, but all these shitty activists have been using the concept of privilege to bully people to make themselves feel better, instead of raising mass consciousness that fuels social movements, which actually changes things.

"It sounds like a lot of work to moderate such a big subreddit.  I can understand how wires get crossed, especially with a grey area like spam/advertising.

But I think this could be a good opportunity to be more specific with your rules and moderation.  Let's enumerate the different types of candidates for promotional content that could be allowed and not allowed.  This will allow moderators and redditors to be on the same page.  And it would minimize the conflicts you mentioned.

May I suggest that instead of a blanket ban on promotional content, we revert [reddit's guidelines on self-promotion](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion) and [on spam](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204536499).  These allow promotional material that **benefits the community** to be allowed.

"&gt; In the City of Seattle, unincorporated King County, Bellevue, and Redmond it is illegal for landlords to discriminate against someone because of their status as a Section 8 voucher holder. Landlords in these areas cannot legally refuse to rent to someone just because they use a Section 8 voucher to pay their rent. Landlords in these areas must initially offer one-year leases for Section 8 voucher tenants, and cannot charge Section 8 tenants a rental rate that exceeds the rate charged to a non-Section 8 tenant. However, landlords do not have to lower their standard market rental rates to make the unit reasonably affordable to Section 8 voucher tenants.

"i don't see a single rule in seattle or reddit that says anything about deleting threads because someone linked to a reddit that careless doesn't like. there's nothing about making it wrong to link to a subreddit because something happened there once that you don't like. 

you have a way to get that content removed from that subreddit. you have that recourse and you should use it. but there's just no reason for you to be removing people linking to another subreddit. ive had my personal information posted in a sub before, i got it removed. what i i didn't do was take power of a complete subreddit and make it my mission to delete any and all links to things that i didn't like.

it's simply you on a power trip because you don't like that community. but that's not seattle's fight, that's your personal battle. what people are trying to say is for careless to keep his personal problems out of moderation. also, a huge group of people wish you would not be a moderator because of your immature behavoir and your abuse of powers as a moderator.

"I've mentioned before that Seattle's tech boom will drive a crime boom as well. Crime syndicates follow jobs just like any other retail industry. People with money are the ones who can support drugs, prostitution, etc. You don't get rich selling crack to poor people, you get rich selling cocaine to rich people. This is just the latest in a continuation of stories and statistics that continue to prove me right.

The story doesn't end there though. There will be a crime boom, followed by stabilization as markets are claimed by larger national and international gangs, violent crimes will drop off but drug addiction and such things will skyrocket. Shortly after this stabilization period Seattle and Washington politics will become increasingly corrupt and controlled by these criminal syndicates. They will then begin to take money via legal means such as taxes, transportation fees, and so on which will go to criminal controlled businesses via contracts for shoddy construction work and other non-materializing services.

The story ends with Seattle being controlled by the gangs that are currently behind this increase in violent crime. Violent crime decreases but everyone ends up being affected by poor and corrupt governance.

"I just want to clarify that the only reason OE can continue selling ammunition in Seattle is because they are a distributor, in addition to being a retailer. So they can lower ammunition prices by 15% and remain (slightly) above water, to soften the blow of 25% tax. For us, we get 9mm ammunition from distributors at $9.95 per 50rd box, and we sell them for $10.99 (because that's what people get it for on the Internet). This includes credit card fees. So if we did the same, we'd be PAYING customers 85 cents per box to take it off our hands.

Also, I expect that city will be making much less than $21k going forward. First, not everyone have caught up with the tax in the first couple of months, so I imagine a lot of customers bought it because they already came for it.

"A lot of folks here are hating on the timelines, even now that the new ones are better across-the-board. We should know by now that even moderate-sized transit projects can take a decade -- and this is an absolutely enormous project, one of the largest in NW history. And ST has a track record for delivering on time, which is miraculous in the infrastructure world. A tighter timeline would inevitably get delayed, and either way Reddit's pet Ballard light rail comes in the 2030s. Infrastructure ain't easy. Plus, as the system slowly grows over the next two decades, gridlock will ease up and those of us stuck in cars and buses will benefit, too.

Honestly ask yourself: do you want transit because you care about Seattle? If you just want your commute right now to be shorter, and you vote NO because half a generation will pass before you get light rail walking distance from your house, then you're really just looking out for yourself. These projects take the whole community to move forward, and we've got an agency who clearly is listening to us and has earned our trust with the Cap Hill and UW line.

"I despise police who don't follow the rules and the reason for stooping these two appears to be very flimsy, but does using the description ""brutalizing"" help? She tried to flee while being questioned by a police officer. I don't see that the officer used excessive force and especially not at a level where ""brutalize"" is apt. He had to stop her from fleeing and she was on a bike. No matter what he did she was going to fall to the ground in that situation. Once she's up against the car he's holding her sweatshirt with one hand. 

&gt;The lawsuit says he tossed her around “like a child’s doll, slamming her into parked vehicles, forcibly shoving his forearm into her chest, grabbing her by the hair and body-slamming her into the pavement,” the suit claims.

&gt;In the video, it also appears that Williams was holding Tillman against a vehicle by her throat for a time.

Where did he body slam her into the pavement? Or slam her into parked cars? Or grab her hair? 

Maybe this stuff happened off camera? 

I think the cop should be reprimanded for stopping the kids for no reason but his actions after that seem pretty much in line with protocol. 

We've all seen those cop chase videos where the cops finally catch the person and start beating on them mercifully. This wasn't even close to those actual instances of brutalizing someone.

Absolutely we should be figuring out how to improve the scores (and really, just educational outcomes) of the less privileged kids, but it's not going to be fixed by more money thrown at the schools themselves.

"I think land use policies will change. Seattle has shown itself to be pretty open minded and dynamic, especially compared to SF (source: grew up in SF). The biggest issue I've seen while living here for about 5 years is when Seattle tries to do something cool, someone gets involved and says ""if we tweaked it slightly, we could make a lot of money"" and things get unnecessarily complicated quickly. 2 steps forward, 1 step back.

SF has much more efficient housing and civic development though, it's been a denser and more popular city for longer than Seattle. Compared to SF, Seattle has *a lot* of unused space. Look at all the yards and parks on Capitol Hill for example. That'll change but it'll take another generation or so, probably not until after everywhere else has filled up, like Beacon Hill, Columbia City, Ballard, Queen Anne, Georgetown, West Seattle. Then when the current owners of houses with huge yards in Cap Hill die, their children will sell to developers who will build incredibly dense condo buildings with retail spaces on the ground floor.

On the one hand, the people who sarcastically say ""Thanks Amazon"" are legit but on the other hand they should also say, ""Thanks Microsoft and Boeing"", along with ""Thanks city hall for doing such a terrible job with planning back when the city was a blank canvas"". It's really shocking how myopic Seattle has been throughout history, always focusing on the short term, always focusing on how to make a quick buck.

Amazon probably wouldn't have built in SLU if Seattle wasn't so well insulated (economically) and so small at the same time. They've made much better use out of what used to be a scary but mindblowingly beautiful part of town, central to everything. SLU sounded like it used to be a hive of scum and villany which is now what ""downtown"" is.

"I think the students raise good points as well. Points that the school has recognized and is working to address and make changes to improve. The problem is that the students are demanding the changes be made immediately and that someone who is clearly an ally to their cause and open to their ideas be fired. It comes across as an attempt to use the fear of being labeled racist (by the school/teachers/etc) to enact their policies on their timeline and to fire anyone that they deem worthy of being fired. It comes across as their attempt to form ""idea police"" that they get to decide who to fire and who to hire (and then if the person they hire says something they don't like - since not all people of color or LGBT people have identical opinions -, presumably they'd get the power to fire them too).

Raising awareness of issues with the curriculum, which has been a problem for hundreds of years (""classical"" education = white male authors, etc, being a very obvious and well-known problem with such an education), is not a bad thing. Even staging an event to raise awareness is not a bad thing. Their unwillingness to compromise and meet the school halfway, when the school clearly is willing to meet them when it doesn't have to do so, and work through designated channels set up now for making the changes is the problem a lot of people have.

I walked toward the Substation, ran into some drunk Fremont regulars, they said that it wasn't the Substation, because they thought it was further away, just as sitniz called me and said that he saw the flash of light in the general direction of the Substation. 

Everyone on twitter was talking about it, and tons of FB posts but nobody knew what caused it.

I figured that tons of people would be at the Substation,if that had been what it was. So almost turned around.

I saw some flashing small lights at the Substation, as I got closer realized it was too workers with flashlights. I figured they were looking for secondary damage caused by wherever exploded somewhere else. I decided to see if I could ask them what happened.

As I got closer I saw that they had a raccoon between them that was chasing after them in a slow staggering manner. The two guys were doing the keep away maneuver, where the farther guy would make the raccoon head towards him until he was the near guy, then repeat.

I have only seen a raccoon a handful of times, and always running away from people.

I yelled through the fence ""is it normal for one to chase after you like that?""

One guy said ""that guy is dazed"", I said ""he is?"". They said ""he is who knocked out the power"". Around that time it stopped coming after them, and they let him wonder off.

It's weird to me that only two people would respond to the power outage's source, and they were inside the enclosed fence, so seemed like authorities on the matter.

"Royal Caribbean in 2012. We had a GREAT time!!!

The things is, we made a point of organizing our own shore excursions. 

In Victoria, we walked all the way from the cruise ship terminal to Craigdarrogh Castle, took the tour (fantastic); stopped for lunch at a cafe on the walk back. 
Cost without lunch: $13 a person.

In Skagway, we spent time in the very cool Gold Rush Museum, then rented a SUV (6 people) and drove up to the Klondike summit. 
Cost: $30 a person.

In Juneau, we took the city bus to the end of the line, then walked 1.5 mile to the Mendenhall Glacier; we hitched a ride on a tour bus to get back into town (we also saw many bald eagles). 
Cost: $1.75 a person.

"The title of the report does not reflect the study's abstract:

&gt;We study the effect of the minimum wage on labor market outcomes for young workers using US county-level panel data from the **first quarter of 2000 to the first quarter of 2009.** We go beyond the usual estimates of earnings and employment effects to consider how differences across states in the minimum wage affect worker turnover via separations and accessions and job turnover through new job creation and job losses. We find that a higher minimum wage level is associated with **higher earnings, lower employment and reduced worker turnover** for those in the 14–18 age group. For workers aged 19–21 and 22–24, we find less consistent evidence of minimum wage effects on earnings and employment. But, even for these age groups, a higher minimum wage is found to **reduce accessions, separations and the turnover rate.**

"I think the large cities along the entire west coast of North America tend to move together, with some variance for local factors (such as Vancouver being in a different country with it's own politics and immigration policies, or San Fran having a severe construction shortage, etc).

Seattle real estate is rising, but so is San Fran, Los Angeles, San Jose, San Diego, Vancouver (BC), and Portland.

As companies that hire folks learn that people like living in the Seattle Metro area, they will continue to build satellite campuses here, as has been done by Google, Facebook, EBay, etc.

This contributes to the housing demand, on top of the demand created by the companies that are already headquartered in the Seattle Metro area: Microsoft, Amazon, Expedia, T-Mobile, Nordstrom, Starbucks, REI, Adobe, Boeing (okay, technically they are Chicago now... but still a giant presence here), etc, etc.

Prices here will continue to rise as long as the West Coast economy is doing well. Nothing will change that in the near future, short of a severe recession/depression that affects multiple economic sectors.

If you already own property here, enjoy the ride. If you are still trying to buy here... good luck.

If you are getting squeezed out, or just care about afordability in general, then reach out to the Major and City Council to implment the full HALA recomendations.

**Re: mass transit &amp; driving**

Based on where you are staying you could honestly walk to many of those destinations if weather and effort permit. Mix it with Lyft/Uber and you'll be able to go beyond those spots  fairly quickly and easily. My partner and I visited 6 years ago (on a virtually identical touristy/less-touristy itinerary) before moving here and during that visit I relied solely on buses and the LINK light rail; ridesharing, had it existed, would have made staying out later or moving quickly that much more convenient. 

**Re: beer**

Bottle shops/alehouses with above average selections (Neighborhood):

* Ballard Beer (Ballard). You can get cans of pretty solid craft for ~$2-3 w/out a corkage fee. Its nice to pad the draft selection.
 
* Toronado (Roosevelt). Born in SF, you can't go wrong with their selection.

* Uber Beer (Green Lake). Wide and varied selection of bottles and draft.

* Duck Island Ale House (Green Lake). Divey spot with a rather inexpensive and extensive bottle/pour list...also fine-enough bar food.

* Chuck's Hop Shop (North Greenwood). Over 40 beers on tap, prices are similar to the ABV of the brew.


For breweries, this [Zagat](https://www.zagat.com/b/seattle/8-hottest-craft-brewery-taprooms-in-seattle#1) (lame I know) list isn't bad. Use it to find spots close to other destinations.

"I don't want to see this thing anywhere near seattle, just because of how lousy the infrastructure is for cars. The sidewalks are cluttered with crap, signs, tourists, half-parked taxi cabs.. and then they want to put a thousand people out on these searching for drinks and food before/after a game. Its been two years since i went to a game in sodo, and all i remember is my bus taking its time, so much traffic.. every side-lot gets turned into a parking lot, businesses around the area are competitive and aggressive about policing their customers. These stadiums can bring a lot of pressure, that i experience going to them as a fan, and also as just someone wandering around going home for the day.

Why a huge stadium right in the busiest most expensive place they could find that would fit it? Thats what seattle is, especially that end of sodo. Put it near that giant empty multiple-acre lot near the end of sodo at the river, where the highway / bridge begins? 

What if they put the stadium in south-center? it wouldnt be far from light rail, close enough to do a shuttle or modify the existing bus traffic. property would probably be 1/4 the cost, more room for bars and resteraunts to build without the well-known high rents/property costs.

"The problem is you'd need to have it continually staffed, maintained, cleaned, and policed.  That would be an expensive proposition.  It would not be unreasonable to expect to have to fund an armed police escort by sanitation workers in the Jungle every time they go do a cleanup.  It would get unsanitary very quickly, so cleanups would have to be frequent.  I'd rather see the money invested in programs that actually help the homeless stop being homeless (housing, job development, etc.).  

I think there's a certain segment of the homeless (that are likely more prominent in the relative isolation of The Jungle) that are always going to choose to be homeless rather than submit to the rules of any program offering assistance (getting sober, working, whatever).  That population is essentially a money pit.  I don't think it's wise to direct limited resources at that population when there are plenty of homeless who would be able to take advantage of programs and follow the rules/requirements to get back on their feet.

State and local candidates will take cues from these presidential primary results. The filing deadline for candidates is a week away, so those campaigns are still developing policy and messaging and getting ready to kick into high gear. 

These results will either reinforce what ""the establishment"" is doing or repudiate it, particularly for Democrats. If there's significantly less support for Sanders than there was in the caucuses, Democratic candidates will take as a sign that Bernie support was just another fad and an endorsement of Hillary's politics and policies.

Republicans didn't have caucuses that awarded delegates, so there's no direct comparison of levels of support possible, but if you've noticed, many GOP candidates in this state have avoided saying whether they'll support Trump as the GOP nominee.

You clearly don't understand the horrors of private prisons. Most private prisons have agreements with the government to keep them at a certain capacity. Its been found that police departs fill these quotas but arresting minorities for small or non-existent crimes and then trump up the charges. Once they are in the private prison the employees of the private company decide on parole. They are incentived to keep people in jail as long as possible. Meaning if two people commit the same crime the one who goes to a privately run prison will stay there much longer than the person going to the publicly owned prison. I don't even see how private prisons are constitutional, only the government has the authority to keep someone against their will, not a corporation.

Convict who are applying to a school are trying to turn their lives around and be a better person. By discriminating against them you are forcing them to go back to their old ways and increasing crime instead of helping to stop it.

"I'm not particularly against allowing businesses to allow pets inside, as I agree the public health risks are probably minimal. But I don't think they should just be allowed everywhere by default. If a particular restaurant wants to designate itself as pet-friendly, I don't really have a problem with that, but I probably won't go to that place. I love animals, but I don't really want them around my food - I'll eat something off the ground, but I'll definitely wash my hands if I've petted a cat in the past few hours.


And I'm a proponent of selective enforcement of laws relative to the severity of the infraction. There should definitely be a speed limit, but I'm happy that the system relies on an officer's discretion to decide whether or not 5 over the limit warrants a ticket.


So I guess I'm maybe content with the system we have now, where bringing a pet into a food establishment is illegal, but rarely enforced. I wouldn't support making it explicitly legal to bring pets everywhere though, because there *are* some health and cleanliness concerns, and it simply seems logical to keep animals separate from our food. There's not really any reason for people to be bringing their animals into restaurants and supermarkets, but if it were legal and socially accepted, more people would do it and the risks to public health would be much larger.


It just seems polite to respect the law and keep your pet away from other people's food. If you take it into QFC and nobody stops you, it's not an endorsement of the activity, but rather just that nobody thought it was a big enough deal to try to stop you.

I love Folklife. I don't hang out under the trees, but I see a lot of shows and have performed in a fair number of them. There are a mix of world-class artists from around the globe, to hometown artists trying their hand at this performance thing. And it's damn cool.

You're right, there's some so-so to downright bad stuff at Folklife. But the great stuff really outweighs it all, and the energy it creates to have all those varied artists and intentions in one place?

"Be careful of your initial assumptions:

Assumption 1:  This cop who pays his bills, works two jobs, has a family and a home is a complete racist sociopath looking to hurt people of color.

Assumption 2:  This cop who's been working security at the mall for some time, in an effort to combat car prowls was specifically watching people that seemed to be wandering around looking into cars.

I completely disagree with the ""safety through overwhelming aggression"" training that's swept over the police forces in this country.    You can't completely separate actions and emotions, and ramping up your actions to full assault mode also starts to color how you feel towards your targets.  It's my fear that officers who have recurring physical altercations are conditioning themselves to feel rage and hatred simply because their training is to act incredibly aggressively.  

But saying ""they were stopped for no reason""  automatically includes the accusation of this person being a sociopathic racist.   He's a cop acting as security, so either believe he's over zealously inclined or he's crazy racist looking to hurt someone.

"I have a bit of a theory question... 

If cis people shouldn't care who uses the bathrooms they're in, why should trans people care who's in the bathrooms they use? 

Why is their discomfort any more valid than anyone else's discomfort? 

Personally I don't give a shit who's in the public bathroom I'm using but I can't help but see this as a double standard. 

If a woman says she's not comfortable with a man using the women's bathroom, she's a bigot and should learn to deal with it. 

If a man who identifies as a woman isn't comfortable using the men's bathroom, she had a totally valid point and we should implement rules to alleviate that discomfort.
