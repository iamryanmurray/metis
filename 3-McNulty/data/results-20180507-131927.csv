That's not really true at all. Lots of people with skills work low paying jobs, and while the bulk of them are service industry there are plenty that aren't. It's also just not ""young"" workers. 

The job market is such that there just aren't that many high paying jobs outside of tech, and while you might favor ""dur just learn to program"" as a solution...not everyone wants to, is capable of it, and even if they were the glut of new tech workers would drive down wages there too.

"I've been to Denver several times, and don't see the appeal. The winters are brutal.

There's a more temperate, lush-green, by-the-water feel to Seattle that my family really enjoyed.

The summers there were unbelievable. The weather right now should be perfect.

And if you do activities on the weekend, you shouldn't hit too much traffic. Or, plan on doing things that go against the rush.  Out of all the stuff we ever did as a family, we weren't inconvenienced by traffic all that much.

I like being on a coast and having coastline nearby, even if it was the Sound. And I liked having pretty mountains to look at. In Denver I felt like the mountains were there, but smaller and further away. On a beautiful summer day when I'd walk out of my house and see the water and mountains and clear blue sky, it felt *special.* The same way destination vacation places feel special.

My main complaint was the isolation. I didn't like being in a place where getting anywhere else (aside from Portland) took forever drive-wise, or a plane ticket, which doesn't work too well with a family.

"What across the country would you compare it to? 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_cities_by_population#United_States

We're the 18th most populous city in the USA, and if not the hottest then the second hottest place in jobs growth, *coming* on the heels of the nastiest economic downtown since the late 1970s.

"Do you have any source for this? It's an often repeated claim, but I really doubt Seattle has above-average foreign investment. Also, foreign investment isn't necessarily bad - you'd also have to show that foreign firms/people owning Seattle apartments hurts people who live here in some way. What about foreigners who want to move here and aren't just using the housing market as a speculative investment?

Here's an [article about LA](http://la.curbed.com/2015/5/13/9961364/just-how-much-foreign-money-is-there-in-the-los-angeles-real-estate) discussing a report ([pdf](http://pdf.euro.savills.co.uk/global-research/12-cities-h1-2015.pdf)) with some data about real estate investment in 2014.

* SF: $21B, 8% cross-border ($1.7B)
* LA: $23B, 11% cross-border ($2.5B)
* NY: $45B, 13% cross-border ($5.8B)
* Chicago: $12B, 9% cross-border ($1.1B)

London, Paris, and Shanghai are 68%, 46%, and 26%, resp.

Unfortunately, no Seattle or Vancouver on the list, but in general:

&gt; US cities attract high levels of investment but this is mainly domestic and they have a lower proportion of cross-border deals than London, Paris and Shanghai, for example.

And there's just no way Seattle competes with LA, SF and NY in this respect. Still, hard data would be nice.

"As an avid reader of this sub, I appreciate rule #5. On a daily basis, I see several if not half a dozen posts from users asking for generic recommendations on x, where/how to find a job here (seriously?), and what to expect when moving here. Or even how to plan a bachelor party. A reasonable person might say all of these questions/life decisions can be made with information easily obtained from a Google search, a Yelp search, or submitting your resume for a job with a Seattle based company. There are also no shortage of websites that will take user input and create a comparative cost-of-living analysis for them. This is due diligence. If you still have a specific or detailed question about x after performing these rudimentary tasks, I have no issue with it being posted here.

These types of posts detract from the community based interaction and relevant news and discussions that I appreciate about this sub. Others may disagree, and that's fine- this is just my opinion. Otherwise, I'm ambivalent as to whether these posts get removed by the mods- I certainly would not characterize it as abuse at all. On the other hand, I will downvote these submissions, as well as any users who engage in providing answers to these submissions that consist of anything other than saying ""see the Sidebar"" or ""/u/seattleconcierge"" or referring them to the Wiki.

Again, just my opinion.

"Welcome to capitalism. Poverty is required under a capitalist economic system. Why? Capitalism requires an exploited class. Capitalists don't make money through their labour. Capitalism makes money by owning private property (property to make profit) from others and stealing the surplus labour of the workers. 

Workers have nothing to sell but their labour. Workers do all the work and create all the wealth for the capitalist, but only receive bread crumbs. Capitalism loves poverty because it keeps wages low and workers fighting each other to sell their labour to the capitalist.

If we want to solve poverty we need a system which prevents poverty.

This system must include:

- Abolishing Private Property: Every worker has access to resources to help them create wealth and every person has easy access to resources to help their lives.

- Access to Shelter: Every person should have access to shelter. Landlords are nothing but leeches to make profit from workers. No one should be denied access or forced to leave because the tenant is unprofitable.

- Access to jobs: Everyone should have access to a job that they want to do as long they are able to do so. Disabled, Elderly, and children are exempted.

- Worker ownership of production: Private owners would be abolished and the store, factory, industry, and etc democratically controlled by the workers.

"My Leroy's story I re-post every time I see a Leroy's reference or a suit buying question: Long story.

Way back in high school in the mid 1980's someone told me an urban legend about Roger Mosley (aka TC on Magnum PI &amp; had a bit part in McQ). The legend was that he was on the game show $25,000 Pyramid. He and his partner got to the last stage where he would give clues and the partner/contestant would answer ""Things that are ____."" If the partner could guess enough right answers she would win the $25,000 prize.

Things are going swimmingly until they got to a clue and the conversation went like this:

Roger Mosley (calm): ""Purple Suit""

Contestant: ""Things that are odd?""

Roger Mosley (patient):""Purple Suit.""

Contestant: ""Things that are colorful.""

Roger Mosley (less patient): ""Purple Suit!, Purple Suit!""

Contestant: ""I don't know. Ummm... Things that men wear?""
Time is now almost out.

Roger Mosley (exasperated and almost yelling): ""Purple Suit!, Purple Suit! PURPLE SUIT!!""

Contestant: ""I don't know, I don't know. Things that are bright?""

Buzzer sounds. The contestant doesn't win. The host comes over and decides to give the contestant a couple of clues just to see if the contestant could get the answer even though the money was lost.

Host: ""A new car. A new house. A fur coat.""

Contestant: ""Things that are nice?""

Host: ""Correct.""

The host looks oddly at Roger and says: ""Purple suit?""

Roger Mosley: ""Where I come from there is nothing nicer than a purple suit.""

Fast forward about ten years. The place that I work had a very successful year. Big year end party and it is made clear to me that I have to do ""something very nice for the occasion.""
So I spend about a week trying to figure out what to do. And then into my head the answer pops: ""Well there is nothing nicer than a purple suit.""

So off I go to find a purple suit in Seattle. I try Nordstrom, The Bon, The Men's Wearhouse. Not only does no one have a purple suit, but they all look at my like I'm an idiot for asking.

A couple nights after giving up my search and knowing that all is lost, I am rolling into the BP Gas Station right next to the Space Needle at 4AM after a Saturday night of having fun. While I am gassing up my car a guy rolls up in a big Caddy. He is wearing a gray shiny shark skin suit and has three of his ""ladies"" in the car with him. He is obviously a player.

Me (Excitedly yelling like a dork at 4 in the morning): ""Oh man I love that suit!""

Player (Jazz cool): ""Thanks man.""

Me: ""You wouldn't happen to know where I could get a purple suit? I've been looking all over the city and all the shops just laugh at me when I ask them.""

Player (Still Jazz Cool): ""Oh yeah man. Go over to Lee-Roy Menswear over on Pike and 2nd.""

Me: (Way too excited by the good news): ""Oh hey thanks man. I really appreciate it."" 

That next Monday I go down to Leroy's (La-Roy's) Menswear. I walk in and look at the guy behind the counter and say:

Me (very cautiously): ""Would you happen to have a purple suit?""

Leroy (looking at me like it is a silly question. The exact same look as the other stores): ""Well of course. We have several. And you have a body like a black guy. They will fit you great.""

I then tell the story of the guy in the Caddy and the shiny sharkskin suit.

Leroy says: ""Oh yeah that is Willy T. Good customer. Big player.""

The other thing I remember when trying on my grimace colored Nehru cut purple suit, was when I asked if should have purple shoes.

Leroy: ""No way. That would make you look gaudy.""

The suit was a huge hit. I was walking down the street in it and a lady slammed on her brakes, rolled down her window and yelled: ""Damn white boy! You look great!"" Without another word she drove off.

I went back and bought another one two years later. I'm still looking for that elusive shark skin dark purple suit.

My friends would invite me to their weddings with the stipulation that I could only show up if I wore one of my purple suits.

tl;dr. There is nothing nicer than a purple suit. Shop at Leroy's Menswear. It is awesome!",,,,purplesuit,,,1467851151,t5_2qhad,t3_4rlmop,t3_4rlmop,26,1471254063,0,0,d52602y,Seattle,26,,

At no point did I think SPD did anything wrong, and I'm usually a big critic of cop mistakes.  They appear to have been significantly patient with Wineberry, who was blustering and accusatory at SPD the whole time, despite there being report of a stolen vehicle.

"I am not the OP but am a software engineer (not amazon) and I believe them. Obviously I don't have people yelling at me as I walk down the street but there are times when I am making small talk with someone and when they ask what I do I can see their eyes roll and then they almost immediately stop talking to me. I've had people rant at me when drunk at bars - not often and not aggressive but it's a little awkward when you are talking to someone and suddenly they are talking about how you are ruining seattle. There are also the passive aggressive posters that people put up about how Amazon and tech bros are ruining seattle. I was at an outdoor show recently for Pride week and one band had their amps way way louder than the other performers and some people called in with a noise complaint and the MC spent 5 minutes ranting about tech bros ruining the neighborhood - not sure if the complainants specified their occupation upon calling.

Just want to clear up a few things though: We hate the high rents as much as everyone else. I genuinely don't see myself ever affording to buy in Seattle and with rent constantly rising it worries me. Do people expect us to ask for lower wages? Also I don't get where the ""tech bro"" stereotype comes from - I think the awkward nerd stereotype is way more accurate.

"Building manager here-

Background checks are essential for the following reasons:

- Evicting people is a long a very expensive process in Seattle. Tenants have a lot of rights (rightly so), to protect them from predatory landlord practices. However, these also give them extensive rights to fight lawful eviction. Once a tenant has signed a lease it is very hard to get rid of a bad tenant.

- I frankly don't want people with extensive criminal records in the building. Previous felony convictions for buglery, larceny, drug (specifically distribution), and of course sex offenders, I am allowed to refuse and I have done so repeatedly. 

- Just because you have the money now, does not mean that you haven't been a hellacious tenant in the past. I do a full rental reference check to insure that you: haven't walked away from a lease, haven't been evicted for destruction of a previous rental, and haven't been a bad tenant (overly noisy, rude, inconsiderate) 

- I want to know that you actually have the income to rent to debt ratio required to rent a unit in the building I run. You may make a lot of money, however if your wages are being garnished due to absurd amounts of debt, it means you won't be able to pay your rent.

- if you have a bad history of credit defaulting, I won't rent to you because I don't believe you have skills to handle your finances and pay on time. 

- the applications are also a way to find out more info about you, if your hobbies include playing the drums for your punk band, I will ask you and insure you understand the noise regulations of the building.
They are not just to disqualify applicants, but to help mangers know their tenants.

I think your view of the rental process and market is a little naive. Just because you are a good person doesn't mean half the people who apply are. We stand in judgement because we frankly can. Running a building is a lot of work, it's all hours, nights and weekends. The property you rent, you don't own. You may live in it for a year or two but it is a long term investment by the building management company.

You have no education on this topic, you have no argument, and now you're deflecting.

"Nobody is happy to hear about kids passing away.  It's tragic and I'm sure what their parents are going through is awful and excruciating.  This is an excellent opportunity to remind everyone that spirited driving is something that many, many teenagers get excited about. They were kids, being kids. It's not bad parenting to let your kid drive a car.  It's not bad parenting to let your kid drive a BMW or any other car for that matter. The morbid reality is that car accidents are the #1 cause of death for teens in the United States. 

Taken from http://www.cdc.gov/motorvehiclesafety/teen_drivers/teendrivers_factsheet.html

* Teens are more likely than older drivers to underestimate dangerous situations or not be able to recognize hazardous situations.  
* Teens are more likely than older drivers to speed and allow shorter headways (the distance from the front of one vehicle to the front of the next). The presence of male teenage passengers increases the likelihood of this risky driving behavior.  
* Among male drivers between 15 and 20 years of age who were involved in fatal crashes in 2012, 35% were speeding at the time of the crash and 25% had been drinking.  

So many people in this country take driving for granted.   **""In 2013, 2,163 teens in the United States ages 16–19 were killed and 243,243 were treated in emergency departments for injuries suffered in motor vehicle crashes. That means that six teens ages 16–19 died every day from motor vehicle injuries.""**

**SIX KIDS A DAY.**  THAT NUMBER IS ENTIRELY TOO HIGH.  So if you want to get on a soap box and preach about being PC, you go right ahead.  I'll be over here pleading with parents to sit there kids down tonight and show them what can happen. Please, talk to your children TONIGHT, show them this news article.  Talk to them about driving safely.  Ask them if they want to learn to drive fast in a safe way. Take them to an autocross! Take them to a track day!  Show them a place where they can safely learn to go fast, because let's face it folks, we as a people (for the most part) like to go fast.  

It's tragic that parents have lost their children, it will be even more tragic tomorrow when more parents lose their children.

A great quote from the late great George Carlin:
“I don't vote. Two reasons. First of all it's meaningless; this country was bought and sold a long time ago. The shit they shovel around every 4 years *pfff* doesn't mean a fucking thing. Secondly, I believe if you vote, you have no right to complain. People like to twist that around – they say, 'If you don't vote, you have no right to complain', but where's the logic in that? If you vote and you elect dishonest, incompetent people into office who screw everything up, you are responsible for what they have done. You caused the problem; you voted them in; you have no right to complain. I, on the other hand, who did not vote, who in fact did not even leave the house on election day, am in no way responsible for what these people have done and have every right to complain about the mess you created that I had nothing to do with.”",,,,rwingvr6,,,1469418741,t5_2qhad,t3_4ug4k3,t3_4ug4k3,-62,1471659040,0,0,d5pkbnl,Seattle,-62,,

"Law traditionally tries to distinguish between two types of fraud.

* **Fraud in the inducement**: A person makes an agreement understanding what they're agreeing to, but only does so because they were misled. For example, X signs a deed giving property to Y, but only because Y lied and said if X didn't, the bank would foreclose.

"Way different culturally - especially in the last five years or so since Amazon really took over. Before then, the East Side was the place where you would see much of the ""I have money, get out of my way"" type of crowd that I am slowly seeing seep into Seattle. You didn't really see the ostentatious displays of wealth that I see now. But I suppose that's to be expected when you dump thousands of new, young people with very high paying jobs into a city that previously didn't quite have that ""world wide"" reputation that we are now building. Kids these days!

Pre-2000. You basically had Boeing, Microsoft as the major players and to a lesser extent UW, WaMu, etc.

In the late 80s and early 90s Microsoft was in an even bigger boom that what we see with Amazon. It had far less of an impact on *Seattle* than what we are seeing with Amazon since MS was off in the boonies of Redmond (and it *was* pretty far out there for that time). I know many folks that retired in their 40s because of Microsoft. (has that ship already sailed with respect to Amazon?) While MS played a huge role in building up the east side into what we see today, it seemed just far enough away that it didn't drastically alter the culture of Seattle itself. We still benefited greatly, but as a Seattleite, MS wasn't in your face every day unless you went to the east side. And really, who actually does that for fun?

Before that, it was basically Boeing and forestry. I think forestry peaked in about 1980 and was about 10x what it currently is today. If you've gone hiking in the cascades, you'll notice all those forest roads. They used to have people working there! Like a lot of people!

Much of Boeing changed in 1997 when they ""purchased"" McDonnel Douglas and then in 2000 when they moved their headquarters from Seattle to Chicago - The Boeing of old left in a literal and figurative sense at that time and its culture has suffered immensely now that they are just another big company.

I guess the city just felt smaller, a little more special and unique, less homogenized. Ballard really was a sort of sleepy Norwegian fishing town. Capitol Hill was the place where all of gay/alt/artist crowd lived - not really sure what you would call it now. And the U-district was always a shit-hole!

"Dealt with this for sometime not too long ago. I didn't mind them until they yelled at the girfriemd, threatened me, dumpster dived, broke into our apartment's mailboxes,  had screaming matches in the middle of the night, trashed the pseudo park, and jerked off and shit in front of older ladies.

First things first, I didn't have much help from the neighbors at first. I would get wasted and start throwing rocks at the tents. It escalated to me chasing off the one guy who happened to be there in the late evening and tossing all of their stuff in the road. One time I went up to a tent and started reciting Cannibal Corpse lyrics. She screamed amd screamed and screamed. 

That stuff kind of turned into a game. It was surprisingly interesting after too many beers.  But it really wasn't scalable - one group leaves and another took their place. It also became increasingly unsafe as they caught on to my antics and began banding together. Most importantly, it wasn't a good thing. The guys were fucked up and more violence wasn't helping anybody.

Eventually,  I found out that my neighbors were just as frustrated as I was. They had already been in contact with the project manager who was working on a nearby park since construction pushed additional dirt bags in our direction. I contacted SPD and the city via the Fix It app as any encampment over a certain amount of structures is illegal. I also contacted the City arborist asking if I should cut down the bushes and a couple of small trees if they didn't - they did it pretty quick. We also made sure to hammer them over and over again. We did not receive any responses to emergency calls but the constant pestering eventually led to emails from cops in the precinct.  

They are now gone except for 1 new guy. I met him the other day and he seems like he is just down on his luck  with only some heroin or meth use. If he keeps the area clean he can do his thing.

Congestion in the 'burbs is going to continue to degrade as the years go on. ST3 helps alleviate a lot of the additional congestion pressure by not only expanding Light Rail through places like Kirkland, Issaquah, Everett and West Seattle, but it completely overhauls our current public transportation options along the I-405 corridor by building out new Transit stations and adding BRT along with other improvements.

"My opinion shouldn't matter here - nobody's opinion should - because these are issues that heavily depend on data, evidence, and years of research. 

Regardless of parental involvement, we have heavily segregated schools based on income, and confounding with race. Poorer children have shittier public schools than wealthier children in WA state, so even if their parents had equivalent involvement, we have a two-tiered, unequal, discriminatory educational system.

Parental income, literacy, education, availability outside of work, etc. - all factor into children's educational success, based on the variety of research I've come across. 

However, when children with disadvantaged parents are *also* attending disadvantaged schools with shittier teachers, we're exacerbating educational inequality.

"Seattle has way more to do with Heaven's Gate than just some donation by Marshall Applewhite.  

Little known fact, the precursor to the Heaven's Gate cult, called the Bride of Christ Church, was formed in Corvallis, Oregon by a man named Edmund Creffield.  This is in the very early 1900s.

Creffield wasn't as much a man of God, as a guy who wanted to score with ladies, so his cult involved stripping naked and rolling around, often ending in an orgy. 

Some local Corvallis residents didn't like that too much, so they literally tarred and feathered Creffield, running him out of town.  

Eventually, Creffield flees to Seattle, where a man named George Mitchell tracks him down on 1st Ave, between Columbia and Cherry, in front of a place called the Quick Pharmacy, and kills him for having sex with Mitchell's sister, Esther.  

Mitchell was found not guilty by reason of insanity and two days later, July 12th, 1906, Esther shot and killed her own brother with a gun supplied by Creffield's widow, Maud.  That murder happened in the waiting room of Union station as he was getting ready to head back to Portland.

The cult basically broke up after that and most of the remaining members moved to Waldport, Oregon and continued their weird ways for decades.  

In the 1970s, Marshall Applewhite's first recruiting meeting to form Heaven's Gate was held in Waldport and he recruited a significant amount of followers whose relatives had been members of a Bride of Christ Church, which was called the 'Holy Rollers' by the locals.  

Weird stuff.

I know of no other customer service job where repeatedly swearing at the customer is considered professional and respectful. I believe the officers were frustrated and acting on emotion. Generally such language does not calm citizens or promote compliance, nor does the tone of voice used convey to a citizen that an officer is going to be respectful of their rights. 

Did the SPD break laws or misconduct? Probably not. 

SPD's conduct professional and respectful; I can not agree with that statement.

"Blame the old mayor who clashed with the council.  Classic.

&gt;Why the huge increase? Back when the project was first budgeted, the council “had limited cooperation” from then-Mayor Mike McGinn in estimating how much it would cost, Murray spokesman Jeff Reading said in a statement Wednesday.  “Without a comprehensive team to establish a reasonable cost for a complex project like this, the $89 million budget … was intended to act as a place holder,” he said.

The survey that said 157 of 158 respondents drove to work alone is interesting.

&gt;Even though nobody indicated they carpooled, two people answered Question 5 regarding how many people they rode with when they carpooled or vanpooled (1=3; 1=4).

&gt;The survey asked respondents for their home zip code (Question 6). There were 80 different zip codes given. The zip code that represented the most number of respondents living in it was 98258 **(way out in Lake Stevens)**

&gt;Question 11 and 12 asked about for the 3 most important reasons for not driving alone/driving alone. 

&gt;58 people wrote in the “Other” category with variations on the theme of no/lack of options given the shift schedules and unpredictability of the start/end times.  The amount of gear (including firearms) that they must carry to work; and **the overall safety issue of riding public transit as a sworn police officer.**",,,,ChefJoe98136,West Seattle,,1469721718,t5_2qhad,t3_4v1899,t3_4v1899,13,1471753126,0,0,d5ukvqs,Seattle,13,,flair

If the condo board made a rule that would normally require a community wide vote (and here it *might*), you are allowed to ask them to cure this by holding a vote with notice.  Generally the board members will overreach their authority unless someone calls them on it.  That's where you come in.  

Usually, Boards will cave-in in order to keep all their *other* stupid rules intact if they took a shortcut in the CCR's rule making process.  In my experience, boards rarely even have enough members to show up much less abide by the record keeping required to make rules.

"All of these people acting smug with experience of badly over-packed transit systems are really missing the point. Just because it's poorly planed and an awful experience elsewhere doesn't mean we should just be apathetic and allow our system to become an awful experience too.

Even getting on at Othello, I almost always have to stand, and nobody gets off until Westlake, where almost the entire train lets out. even just a few short months ago it was a pleasant, comfortable, even peaceful experience. Now, I will sometimes get up earlier or decide on being late to work because *the bus* has become an easier, if much slower, option.  

Honestly, the thing that annoys me most are the tourists/travelers that pack the train with a bunch of luggage and use it as a means of taking up multiple seats, or even the entire handicap sections. Or they put a bag on a seat instead of underneath them or on their lap. I think there would be a good 15% or so more seats if people had manners.

"ITT - quite a few people who find it difficult to accept this type of hurtful racism exists in Seattle. It does. Since relocating here I've been stereotyped more than any other state or country I've ever lived or visited at length. The racism here feels quite passive aggressive. I personally had an experience a few years back where someone left a note on my car calling me the ""N"" word and a black bitch. I did nothing to warrant it or provoke it. I reported it to the authorities. But it went nowhere. I moved to a different neighborhood a month later. At the time the racial climate wasn't as tense as it is now.. so it wasn't news. Plus, I'm a black woman, our issues typically aren't newsworthy. 

My heart breaks that this happened to this family. You feel so unnecessarily bullied, violated, confused, picked on, helpless, and tired..as all you did to piss someone off was walk around in an unacceptable skin color. You try to shake it off, ""rise up"", ""turn the other cheek"" ""stay strong and proud"" and all that, but it always stays with you. I'm glad the kids are only 4.. they shouldn't have to remember this. I love this city for a myriad of reasons and after 10 years I've FINALLY made real friends.. but sadly, I can't take the stereotyping and passive aggressive racism anymore, it's exhausting - so I'm moving next year. 

I wholeheartedly believe this happened to this family. It's so sad. I hope it isn't true.

The eggplant appetizer is fantastic and the vegan might enjoy that - the pieces are battered and fried so they look almost like big french fries and have a nice crust.  The money bags appetizer is also really good.

You can probably do well with Thai.  Rice and rice noodles are gluten free, most entrees can be vegetarian (not sure about Vegan) and I can't think of any dish that would contain lactose.

You can walk around Fremont afterwards, get an ice cream at Bluebird (sorry vegan and lactose intolerant kids), and maybe stroll over to take photos at the troll.",,,,joemondo,Fremont,,1467848422,t5_2qhad,t3_4rl45v,t3_4rl45v,34,1471253214,0,0,d52476n,Seattle,34,,flair

"Completely absurd to suggest that Dan Newhouse doesn't care about health:

There isn't a single scientific or health reason to label GMOs: [2000+ studies have found GMOs to be safe](https://www.geneticliteracyproject.org/2013/10/08/with-2000-global-studies-confirming-safety-gm-foods-among-most-analyzed-subject-in-science/) without a single credible study to the contrary. The [vast majority of science and health organizations](http://gmopundit.blogspot.com/p/450-published-safety-assessments.html) support GMOs. This comprises [hundreds of organizations.](https://www.geneticliteracyproject.org/2015/06/16/240-global-science-organizations-affirm-consensus-for-gmo-food-and-crop-safety/)

Hundreds of thousands of GMO-free options are available including certified organic, 40,000+ non-GMO products, other GMO-free labels, Whole Foods, Central Market, co-ops, farmer's markets, CSA boxes, online shopping, etc.

GM labeling killed the GMO industry in Western Europe against the advice of the vast majority of their scientists and a 10 year review by the EU. The foremost anti-GMO activists [openly admit this is their aim with labeling in the U.S.](https://www.geneticliteracyproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/GLP-right-to-know-infographic.pdf) 

It's also worth noting that GMO labeling ballot measures have failed in every state in which they've been proposed--even progressive states like Oregon, Washington, and Colorado. 

Above all, the label is somewhat arbitrary: [Anti-GMO activists support the random mutagenesis of entire genomes](http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/500409-its-labeled-organic-but-its-genes-were-scrambled-with-gamma-rays/), potentially causing unpredictable mutations in tens of thousands of genes, but somehow manipulating a single gene is an outrage.

"Well, that's the problem for the last 50+ years: We talk out of both sides of our mouth when it comes to housing prices. We keep *saying* we want affordable housing yet we continually support actions that *increase* housing prices (mortgage tax deduction, incentives for first time buyers, zoning laws, tax exemption on gains for moving into a new primary occupancy, etc) and act as if it is some basic human right that everyone should own a house. Low housing prices and promoting everyone that can fog a mirror getting a house tend to be mutually exclusive when it comes to places people actually want to live. Note that this is not a Seattle-specific issue, this is at the national level.

I get annoyed when I hear politicians say they want affordable housing as they blindly ignore what that actually means: lower housing prices. So okay, we change the zoning and build a *ton* of new houses. Now the vast majority of the people who purchased in the last 10 years see a loss in their home's value and are potentially underwater on their mortgage or (ideally) zilch for return on housing prices for the foreseeable future. Try phrasing it that way to the people that want affordable housing and their brain goes into this cognitive dissonance - ""but can't *my* house stay the same value and all the new ones be cheap?"" This is especially difficult to promote in a country where the vast majority of the middle/lower class has their total net worth tied up in their primary residence. Good luck getting that passed by the voters who own a home, let alone developers, realtors, and other vested interests. It also doesn't help a city that utilizes (drumroll) housing prices for taxes. You can bet they plan on that inflation in housing prices in their tax revenue projections.

So if building a shit ton of houses and cratering prices isn't a feasible option, then we're exactly where we currently are now: subsidizing for those deemed ""poor enough"" - yet there will always be more people than there are subsidized houses - not to mention knock-on effects of attracting *more* people to the city if you happen to have a truly large amount of affordable, subsidized housing....so lather, rinse, and repeat.

EDIT: I would also add that simply removing zoning laws so more housing can be built may not actually result in lower prices. Nobody forces those developers to build and they have a nasty habit of *not* building when prices go down as they want to actually make money (think of all of the empty lots and half finished buildings from 2009-2011). It might shorten/subdue boom periods as they can add more units at a faster pace, but I would be surprised if they kept building to the point that we saw prices go down significantly.

As an aside, I hate that comparison to Houston's policies being some cure to our woes as it ignores the obvious geography differences at play between Seattle (or SF) and Houston. Houston can expand in 3 directions almost indefinitely. They have over 7x the area of Seattle, yet only ~3x the population. They are the opposite of the density these same proponents keep advocating. It makes sense why it works there: it's way easier for people to cope with expansion into farmland rather than increasing density in existing neighborhoods.


TL;DR: We pretend we want lower housing prices but do everything in our power to keep them high. ""Affordable housing"" really means ""lower prices"" - something that many people don't actually want. Vested interests will ensure prices never go down (if they can help it, of course), so nothing will ever change. Also, Houston is a massive colony of suburb-esque housing and people should stop pointing to it as a model for increased density through lax zoning laws.",,,,cartmanbeer,,,1468900736,t5_2qhad,t3_4tij4u,t3_4tij4u,26,1471523979,0,0,d5hr37g,Seattle,26,,

"This is largely true, but there is one caveat worth mentioning: property taxes are tax deductable both for residences and rental properties (provided you itemize). The owner recoups a portion of the property taxes in proportion to their marginal tax rate. So the most accurate way of explaining it would be to point out that the *tax-effective* increase in property taxes is passed down at more-or-less the same rate as to homeowners.

This has one other effect that would probably upset those on the left, if they were aware of it: **property taxes are regressive**. Higher income -&gt; higher marginal tax rate -&gt; larger percent of property tax increase recouped via reduced federal taxes -&gt; smaller proportional tax-effective hit due to property tax increase.

None of this is evidence whatsoever that you have *any* education on the history of the U.S.'s mixed economy. Any economist looking at the highest indicators of prosperity an social well being would find that they fared best when the U.S. government fostered strong investments in R&amp;D and social goods and institutions.

If you had an education on American prosperity, you'd know that it was at its highest when public investment was at its highest. Try and argue against, this fact - I dare you.

&gt; and do not agree with your assertion, 

Then you're disagreeing with a simple empirical account of history. You're out of your wheelhouse here. Sorry, your little finance B.A. didn't educate you in history or political economy. 

Markets and prosperity fare best with a strong mixed economy - which is how we lift people out of poverty. You're entirely ignorant on the basic premises of institution building and political economy. You're entitled to your opinion, even if it is incorrect and uneducated. 

**[Here](https://catalog.simonandschuster.com/TitleDetails/TitleDetails.aspx?cid=12456&amp;isbn=9781451667820) is an excerpt from the recent compilation of studies that I just linked**:

&gt; “Life expectancy rose only modestly between the Neolithic era of 8500 to 3500 BC and the Victorian era of 1850 to 1900.13 An American born in the late nineteenth century had an average life expectancy of around forty-five years, with a large share never making it past their first birthdays.14 Then something remarkable happened. In countries on the frontier of economic development, human health began to improve rapidly, education levels shot up, and standards of living began to grow and grow. Within a century, life expectancies had increased by two-thirds, average years of schooling had gone from single to double digits, and the productivity of workers and the pay they took home had doubled and doubled and then doubled again. With the United States leading the way, the rich world crossed a Great Divide—a divide separating centuries of slow growth, poor health, and anemic technical progress from one of hitherto undreamed-of material comfort and seemingly limitless economic potential. For the first time, rich countries experienced economic development that was both broad and deep, reaching all major segments of society and producing not just greater material comfort but also fundamental transformations in the health and life horizons of those it touched. As the French economist Thomas Piketty points out in his magisterial study of inequality, “It was not until the twentieth century that economic growth became a tangible, unmistakable reality for everyone.”15 The mixed economy was at the heart of this success—in the United States no less than in other Western nations. Capitalism played an essential role. But capitalism was not the new entrant on the economic stage. Effective governance was. Public health measures made cities engines of innovation rather than incubators of illness.16 The meteoric expansion of public education increased not only individual opportunity but also the economic potential of entire societies. Investments in science, higher education, and defense spearheaded breakthroughs in medicine, transportation, infrastructure, and technology. Overarching rules and institutions tamed and transformed unstable financial markets and turned boom-bust cycles into more manageable ups and downs. Protections against excessive insecurity and abject destitution encouraged the forward-looking investments and social integration that sustained growth required. At every level of society, the gains in health, education, income, and capacity were breathtaking. The mixed economy was a spectacularly positive-sum bargain: It redistributed power and resources, but as its impacts broadened and diffused, virtually everyone was made massively better off.” ",,,,lil_vega,,,1467667402,t5_2qhad,t3_4r7uxs,t1_d4z8ufx,10,1471203605,0,0,d4z8xye,Seattle,10,,

"It depends.

NORMAL PEOPLE: 

Sell, then buy.

If you're a ""normal,"" you pretty much have to sell before you buy a house. You need cash for a down payment. Normal people don't have $200,000 in cash lying around.

And if you scrimp to just barely get it together, it can still be tough (but not actually that tough) to get financing for a second house. You'll pay an extra percentage point for the mortgage if it's a second house and you'll just barely have enough downpayment when sellers prefer people with 30+% (and plenty of people have that).

So you can either:

 - make a ""contingent"" offer on a house. The bad news is no one will take this offer if the competing offers are cash or non-contingent, so you're stuck making offers on the left overs that didn't sell in 2 weeks.

OR

 - Sell your house and get a short term rental. The bad news is you have to move twice and find someone who will rent to you and waste a lot of cash. It gives you more time though! Heck - it will probably take a year to win a bidding war anyways.

You'll probably be waiting around a long time for a house to come on the market and to win the subsequent bidding war on it under either of these scenarios unless you are willing to be the most desperate person in the next bidding war and you can afford to be this person. 

Or you're a weirdo who likes ""quirky"" houses that don't sell. It's okay to be a weirdo. Just own it.

The good news is it's really easy to sell your house! Price it reasonably close, but below market and you'll get a bidding war. You get top dollar today. It isn't like anyone can sell a house for the same price - there's lots of upside if you can get it fixed up, looking good, get the right photos and getting it staged.

RICH PEOPLE:

If you have cash, you can buy your next house before selling your current one. It's better - you only have to move once, you can get out of your old house before you can fix it up and stage it.

Time is also on your side - you won't be stuck in limbo after you sell your house. You can wait until the right house comes on the market and see if you can / want to actually afford it. Once you get it, you can move and then sell your old house. 

If you play this right, it can really make you money if you buy in the fall or the winter and then list your old house in the early spring. Prices appear to actually go up every spring as more buyers are in the market.

(It's okay if you want to call yourself middle class, but if you own a house and also have $200,000 lying around, you're pretty rich.)

Is the patio exposed to full sun when the dog is left out? If this is the case, and there is no doghouse or shade provided, then this is a clear violation. 

Is there a water bowl? Fresh water should be available at all times. 

Is the pup exposed to its own poop or pee while on the patio? Waste is required to be cleaned up on a daily basis.

"This is a pretty common argument that I hear. However, you're missing one key part: Bicycles do not damage the roads that they ride on to nearly the degree that cars do.

The U.S. General Accounting Office has a study that concludes that road damage is related to the per-axle weight raised to the 4th power.

Let's say a bicyclist on the road weighs 200 lbs, that's 100 lbs per axle Let's call this ""1 Unit of road weight"" (basically looking at damage cause relative to a bicycle) 1^4 = 1, 1 Unit of Damage

Let's take your standard everyday Prius which weighs about 3,000 lbs (a little bit more but we'll round down to make the math a touch easier by working with round numbers). That's 1500 lbs per axle. 1500/100 = 15 road weights, and if the relationship were linear that would mean that the Prius is causing 15 units of road damage, but it's not. 15^4 = 50625 Unit's of road damage. 15 Times the weight causes 50,000 times the damage.

Then look at an 18-wheeler, that cab and trailer empty start at about 30,000 lbs, or 60 units of road weight (5 axles). 60^4 = ~12.9 million units of road damage. Or 256 times that of a car (and note of course I'm assuming the trailer is empty and an even distribution of weights among the axles, which is inaccurate).

The state would hemorrhage money trying to license and register and keep track of bicyclists, who would not want to pay more than their share of taxes for the roads they use. 

This also ignores the fact that most bicyclists also already have a car and pay license, registration, and insurance on that, so are already paying for the roads that you're driving on in the ways that you want them to drive.

Would you rather have more cars on the road causing more damage that hurts everyone or more open roads that are easier and safer to navigate?",,,,PendragonDaGreat,Federal Way,,1467480544,t5_2qhad,t3_4qxfpo,t1_d4wpedr,12,1471160339,0,0,d4wrhjb,Seattle,12,,flair

"**OP!**

You need to go to this website: http://aptfinder.org/listings.php

It is a list of all the low income housing apartments in Seattle, including ones with vacancies.

You also should check out this: http://www.seattle.gov/housing/renters/find-housing 

Click private apartment buildings, it appears three have openings:

- Link Apts, 4550 38th Ave. SW, 866-346-2724 has 2 vacant 1 bedrooms at 80%AMI income and rent limit (6/24)

- Othello Station South, 4219 S Othello St, 206-782-8466 has vacant MFTE 1 bedroom at 80%AMI income and rent limit. (5/19)

- Lofts at the Junction, 4535 44th Ave SW, 855-547-9353 has vacant MFTE studio at 65%AMI income and rent limit. (6/6)

That last one is the one you probably want. I have no idea about your income/budget for this sort of thing, but these two websites can help you! 

Also, any of the buildings in that list that are showing as ""new"" are worth contacting to see if they have any MFTE units available (units restricted to certain income thresholds).

Seattle organizations that can help you find low-income housing.  There are options out there.  Putting them in a comment reply:

I say that as someone whose property taxes have shot up from $4k to $6k per year in the past 2 years alone due to appreciation (I'm also near a light rail station).  When I sell, though, I will easily get $200k in profit tax-free; that more than makes up for the $2k/yr extra that I'm paying.  If I choose to stay here, it'll keep climbing.  If I choose to sell, I can stick that $200k in low-cost index funds and get $8k/yr in passive income (assuming 4%; that's 7% minus 3% inflation).

"Why do you need a house with 3-4 bedrooms and 2k square feet? A lot of people live in apartments. Even people who live in houses usually have smaller houses. Older houses tend to be closer to 1000 sq ft for 3 bedrooms. Also, a lot of people who own houses bought their houses before the real estate price increased sharply. (My house was $385k in 2013. Zillow/Redfin claims that it's over $600k today. Obviously take it with a grain of salt, but also realize that I didn't pay $600k for my house. It's also a 920 sq ft 2 bedroom 1 bathroom in West Seattle.)

And yes, people do get paid more. Ft Worth minimum wage is $7.25/hour (and $2.13/hour for tipped employees). [Seattle's minimum wage is $10.30-$13/hour depending on how you work for, even if you're a tipped employee.](http://www.workingwa.org/seattle-minimum-wage/) So other jobs get ""squished"" up in the wage range as well.

And yes, there are also a lot of software developers. Software engineer interns can get paid $7500/month for their summer internships. So full time engineers make even more, if they're hired by a competitive company.

"Your best bet here, is either surreptitious sabotage (using a laser pointer to burn out the camera for example) or using the HOA game to your advantage. For example, can you put up some semi-permanent structure to block the view? Get one of those gazebo things or a parasol umbrella from Home Depot and block the view. When they inevitably complain to the HOA bring it up at the next meeting, they'll look incredibly creepy for filming you AND THEN kicking up shit for not being able to see you gf's movements on camera - use it as an opportunity to push for rules of external camera placing by residents to stop this. OR would a camera from your gf's apartment be able to view your neighbors movements some way? If so, set up a camera (hell even a dummy one would work) yourself, if they kick off then you can go for a mutual withdrawal of all cameras by both of you.

Personally, I don't think it's a huge deal, if it doesn't look into a property its tantamount to him just looking out his window all the time - it's still weird and creepy, but basically harmless. There are people like this in every neighborhood. And I get the sensitivities of it - my ex-roommate made a huge fuss because I set up a webcam by our back door to monitor the cat flap (I suspected - rightly as it turned out - a random ass cat was coming into our house at night and my cat was too much of a pussy to do anything about it) and it would, as a happenstance, record the ankles of anyone doing laundry.

"So, a specific individual makes a fatal error in judgement, breaking lane and light usage laws, and a person dies as a result...  The city chooses not to prosecute under the ""accidents happen"" perspective... and now they find themselves liable for $3.5M.

I hope the city learns from this.  If a person dies on the street, and neither user is found to have caused the act, then the street's design is at fault.

I don't actually think that's the case here, but I do think it's fair to set it as a legal expectation.  Perhaps it will drive municipalities to treat criminal negligence on our streets *as criminal negligence on our streets*, or take on the liability for the damages themselves.

Note that I'm not saying anything like ""that guy needs to go to jail!!"" - punishment should fit the crime even when the outcome is extreme - but even a relatively small (as in non-jail) criminal penalty (ie, applying the vulnerable user law) would establish fault, which in turn establishes a more fair and reasonable legal paper trail for potential liability suits like this one to follow.",,,,defiancecp,Capitol Hill,,1468696084,t5_2qhad,t3_4t5tq2,t3_4t5tq2,27,1471473167,0,0,d5etl0k,Seattle,27,,flair

"Playing devils advocate is fine and all.

However, the types of occupations you cite are poor examples as they are not equivalent to a peace officer equipped with a taser, night stick, pepper spray, firearm, and high performance chase vehicle. The potential risk to a member of the public in the event of negligence or purposeful misconduct by a peace officer is significantly more severe. A closer analogy would be to look at professionals such as medical doctors (including dentists), architects, structural engineers (or any other professional engineer really), and lawyers. All of these professionals are required to obtain substantial education, on the job training, and licenses to practice their profession and must maintain continuing education standards. They all must also carry personal and/or professional liability insurance (frequently exceeding $1million dollars per occurrence per practitioner for some professions). This is the case almost universally around the world because these professions have the potential to cause life changing negative consequences to the people they serve even through unintentional negligence.

Now take a moment and think about the standards of education, training, and degree of potential liability typically associated with law enforcement occupations. Do you feel that an adequate standard is being applied to them? Do you feel that some form of liability insurance is or is not appropriate (caveat here is who pays: officer, union, or department are all taxpayer by proxy)? What do you think would be a better devil's advocate position to address the question of liability insurance? I'm not suggesting liability insurance is necessarily a good tactic for addressing this topic, but it is an interesting thought experiment to go through.",,,,Interestedinthat,,,1468398759,t5_2qhad,t3_4sk7o0,t1_d5a7twe,19,1471395839,0,0,d5acp8d,Seattle,19,,

Q. *""Did your union representative claim that a minority is hunting them, organized by the color of their skin?*

A. Yes, on July 10, 2016, Our union expressed solidarity with a police department in Dallas TX by condemning people based on skin color, not based on probable cause, or even proximity to Dallas where this crime occurred.

Q. And did your union advise SPOG members to act?

A. Yes.  They warned us to keep ""heads in a swivel.""

Q. What does that mean to you?

A. That the enemy, minorities, are plotting to harm members of SPOG.

Q.  And you pay money to this organization, SPOG, that would condemn seattle minorities for the action of a sniper 3000 miles from Seattle based upon white fright?

First of all, 10 lane highways would do nothing to relieve our congestion issues and lane limits aren't the source of most congestion problems.

We're nowhere near capacity for light rail as it's currently sitting. Most stops are 2 car still, and this isn't even accounting for the additional lines we are building. For each line, there's a max capacity of 16,000 people per hour and after ST3 is done we'll have a total of 3 different lines, amounting to 48,000 per hour max, or just under 1 million max per day.

"Guilty unless you're have enough money to prove your innocence? Sorry but these gun control groups are positioning themselves farther and farther to the fringe. Americans do believe in basic gun restriction and we do have them.

Removing due process is not a popular concept for the overwhelming majority of Americans. 


&gt; There is a hearing, but it can be in the county of the person filing, not where the gun owner lives (e.g. someone in Seattle could be forced to defend in Spokane County).

&gt;- There may not be actual notice to the gun owner.  Service by mail or publishing in a newspaper might be enough (i.e. the gun owner may have no idea that there is even a hearing before their rights are taken away).

&gt;- The burden of proof is preponderance of the evidence (i.e. 50.01%).  Usually, to take away someone's rights you need ""clear and convincing"" evidence, which is a higher burden of proof.

&gt;- Hearsay is admissible as proof (e.g. someone told me that. . .).

&gt;- The court can consider threats, even if they don't involve a firearm.

&gt;- The court may consider use of controlled substances, whether or not it is related to any firearms.

&gt;- The recent purchase of a firearm may be grounds for a protection order.



&gt;So, overall, the initiative has a low burden of proof, you may not even have actual notice of the hearing, you may be called to defend a case 300 miles away, hearsay statements may be considered, and the standards for the court to consider don't even necessarily relate to dangers with a firearm.

"I'm going to chime in.

Reading the whole article reveals the following chain of events: a vice complaint was filed by a civilian. Police completed a sting operation on the providers and will prosecute the owner for only two counts of promoting prostitution, though there were five women working. The police told the landlord who agreed to allow SPD to use the premises in a sting operation targeting clients. SPD conducted the sting, made arrests, and that's the main point of the article.

First: prosecutors generally throw all charges possible at a suspect just in case. (Source: personal friend who is a defense attorney). The fact that trafficking was not among the charges and that only two of five potential counts of promotion stuck (apparently according to the article) is telling.

Second: Seattle has an enormous sex work community because it's a liberal city and because SPD had for some years turned a blind eye to small independent local providers (source: 100+ personal friends and professional contact). It stands to reason that there is exploitation among a population overwhelmingly composed of women much as there is among the non sex working female population.

Third: It is reasonable to assume that the population most often face to face with LE (youth, woc, street based workers, lgtbq, etc) is the most at risk and likely the most often exploited. I would not disagree that the use of fraud, force, and coercion to cause people to enter sex work is real. I would argue that it is far less a chunk of the sex economy than popular media makes it seem (source: my own personal experience, repeated enough times to constitute a statistically reasonable sample size).

Fourth: thank you for the work you do towards helping those who wish to exit sex work your compassion, your aid, and the chance to speak up for themselves. SWOP, the Sex Workers Outreach Project, conducts regular sweeps of known streets where they can share information, hygiene and safer sex supplies, a listening ear, and exit services for those wishing to move on. You can find them at www.SWOP-Seattle.org and connect with them to work together towards the shared goal of protecting women who do not wish to be sex workers.

"Here's my perspective on it.  I absolutely hated living in a new apartment complex that allowed dogs, and I LOVE dogs.  Of the very small green common areas the tenants had available to them, 150% of it was constantly inundated by dog piss and shit.  Literally hundreds of medium sized dogs in this apartment complex, it felt like I was living in the worlds most expensive kennel. They replace the grass every year because its all dead within a few months.  What if I want to use the common areas? Out of the question. What if I don't want the insanely strong smell of vinegar every time I walk outside? SOL. Its like I lived in dog India.

I can understand the ""creep's"" perspective.  What if instead of calling the grass ""the pet relief area"" its actually a common area where people might do yoga, exercise, have a picnic, something other than wallow in piss?  Have you considered that?

Secondly, I moved from that apartment complex and now I have a security camera in my yard because I've had my car prowled and mail stolen.  I can see a live feed from my phone if I want to, but it also records to a memory card.  One time my mail was stolen, I think it was in the middle of the night.  I tried reviewing the footage to get a glimpse of the thief, and do you have any idea how hard it is to go back through hours and hours of footage to see one specific thing? It takes FOREVER. What exactly are you worried about?  If anything the camera provides protection. You are on surveillance camera's many times per day. Why not let it be?  If the guy wants to take up the task of watching footage of every time your gf and her mother go through there, he's basically volunteering a second job and wasting hours of his time everyday. It's not anything to worry about in my opinion. 

My advice is, let it be. There's nothing to confront, if anything just have a conversation with the guy and ask him questions, try to get his perspective on it. ",,,,ReducingRadius,Crown Hill,,1469646834,t5_2qhad,t3_4uw4df,t3_4uw4df,35,1471732137,0,0,d5td8oi,Seattle,35,,flair crown-hill

"RE: The girls that slept with this guy for the porn audition...

I'm not trying to judge them or defend the guy in the article when I say this, but they weren't raped.  Conned, sure on some level... But they decided to have sex, with a stranger, for the purposes of getting into a business where they would continue to have sex with strangers for money.  They made a conscious decision to get involved in an industry rife with drugs, crimes, exploitation, and all sorts of other nasty human behavior.  I have some sympathy for them sure, but to equate this to rape only serves to add to the tendency to question/judge the victims of actual sexual assault.

If a guy tells a girl at a bar that he's a doctor and impresses her to the point that she sleeps with him, only to find out the next morning he drives a taxi, is that rape?  If a small porn producer films his own porn and then withholds payment to one of his actors, does that change the otherwise consensual sex into rape?

If he was legitimately starting an adult film company using amateurs but funding backed out of his first film, would that make any audition/screening sex between consenting adults into rape?

Devils advocate hypotheticals, I know.  But don't think comparisons wouldn't be made at trial.

The thing that rape lacks, is consent.  Auditioning for a porn shoot by fucking a stranger does not imply a lack of consent.

Again, while I feel some sympathy for those involved, it sounds like a portion of them were simply making an uninformed business decision.  That is not rape.  Hopefully, they learned their lesson to either be more informed next time they want to do porn, or to find something they're better at.


*EDIT* Apparently those who lack reading comprehension make up for it with righteous indignation.  The girls I'm referring to were part of a different article and were not blackout drunk acquaintances but girls he allegedly recruited for porn off the internet under false pretenses, as discussed in a previous Stranger article.

"I'm not at all an expert, but I think this is covered under Part IV, Section 27 of Washington Initiative Measure No. 502:

  http://sos.wa.gov/_assets/elections/initiatives/i502.pdf

As far as ""where is our weed tax money aggregating?"" goes, I think you're asking where does it go after it has been collected by the Washington State Liquor and Cannabis Board? If so:

&gt; All revenues collected from the marijuana excise taxes imposed under subsections (1) through (3) of this section shall be deposited each day in a depository approved by the state treasurer and transferred to the state treasurer to be credited to the dedicated marijuana fund.

As far as ""who is receiving this money?"" goes, that's covered in detail in section 28, but it's a mix of the department of social and health services, the state general fund, the University of Washington alcohol and drug abuse institute, the state liquor control board (to pay for administering the program), and for the bulk of it (50%), the state basic health plan trust account.

You can see a picture of the breakdown on Wikipedia here:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Initiative_502#/media/File:I-502_Revenue_Dispersion.png

Note that this took only a minute or two to research and I've never looked into it before, so please don't take my word alone for it.

"&gt; Who the hell are you to say how this sub should be run?

Well, according to the mods, we're a community. That's right there in rule #6, the one this post is about.

My understanding of that word is that the community is more than the mods, it's also the subscribers and active posters of the subreddit. To me, that implies that the mods would welcome input from the community on what the standards for this place are.

&gt; I have opinions about economics, finance and public policy.

Yes you do, Tim. Yes, you do. Hm, let's look at your full bio on ""Forbes"" (lest we forget which is name for fiscal arch-conservative and right winger billionaire *Steve Forbes*)...

&gt; I'm a Fellow at the **[Adam Smith Institute in London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Smith_Institute)**

Oh, what's that, on Wikipedia?

&gt; The Adam Smith Institute (ASI) is a free market libertarian think tank and lobbying group

Uh huh...

&gt; It advocates free market and classical liberal ideas, primarily via the formation of radical policy options with regard to Public Choice theory, which political decision makers seek to develop upon. The President of the ASI, Madsen Pirie, has sought to describe the activity of the organisation as ""We propose things which people regard as being on the edge of lunacy...""

You don't say, go on...

&gt; The ASI formed the primary intellectual force behind privatisation of state-owned industries during the premiership of Margaret Thatcher...

"I voted against it; I don't see it as doing anything more than doubling down on status quo, *but*, the status quo has not significantly helped us.  I would ask the City Council to propose a new direction.

Me, I suggest that if we want to throw giant piles of money at something, we start at mental health, job retraining services, welfare to cover sudden loss of jobs, and ensuring that long-term care for the mentally dysfunctional is a thing (rather than having them stumble around the streets wanting a bit of food).   I'm not a policy wonk, but that's the direction that I'd push.

More broadly, I'd suggest pushing the entire King County region to upzone to allow developers to be building high density in lower areas.


edit: I think there are probably valid reasons to reup the status quo. But I haven't seen any obvious ones, and I don't *like* the status quo on homelessness &amp; affordable housing.

When I did, the attendant said, ""the manager saw in on the camera, so she'll be taking care of it."" Sure enough, they were sent out of the holding area and back up the hill, missing at least a couple of ferries additional to what they would have waited for.

"After nearly two decades here I also love the rain, but I love certain types of rain more than others. You know that old saw about Eskimos having 14 words for snow? It's the same here with rain.

Other longtime locals will recognize the 'one drop out of nowhere every minute' rain, which in other parts of the country is usually taken as a precursor to heavier rain (and the end of the outdoor part of your BBQ) but here is indicative of absolutely nothing.

There's regular rain like ma &amp; pa still get it back in ol' Kentuck but we don't see much of that here do we? Sleet too...so much sleet...so little actual snow. We get that sideways rain out of the North Pacific too, accompanied by a powerful wind: the Umbrella-Killer. Once in a blue moon we'll get the ""HFS are we in New Orleans?"" deluge too.

You know just from the chain of events that regulatory capture happened.

I get that many were overjoyed by having rental bikes be deployed, but ask yourselves this guys - if this had been for something you did not personally support, would you have been as all-in-favor of the backroom dealing it took to make it happen?

Seattle likes to pride itself on being ""not like Chicago"" or ""not like the East Coast.""  What we had here basically was an outsider coming in here and doing business-as-usual Chicago-style - you scratch my back I scratch yours, that kind of thing. 

Listen, that style of government absolutely can work.  But it strikes a lot in the Northwest as inherently unfair and immoral.  Were competitive bids taken on ride share bike companies?  Was a Northwest company sought out as a possibility instead of the DC / Chicago based company?  Did the fact Pronto had already failed as a private company strike anyone as maybe being a sign things were not as great as Kubly said?  Things like that.  The end-around what had to be existing law strikes many here as just wrong.  Despite the outcome of rental bikes.

If the idea of rental bikes being owned by the City was so great, it should have sold itself, it should not have needed an insider stage-managing the acquisition and quite possibly profiting personally from it.

"I would run and draw because I suck at sprints. Staying static against a knife will get you killed especially if your gun is holstered.

A good shooter who knows an attack is coming can draw from concealment and fire a single round in a second. The average person from 7 yards can close with you from a dead halt in 1.5 seconds. Those are averages. Handguns are also extremely poor people stoppers. You could need to dump a magazine and reload to get a stop.

My advice is that creating distance creates time for you. Put things and space between you and your attacker.

Women in particular are taught to be protective of their bodies, but suddenly millions of us are expected to accept that a stranger can grope us even though they aren't cops and we haven't been accused of a crime.

"Could you clarify for me what the non-emergency number is for? Since it seems like there's a lot of conflicting messages out there.

I feel like me calling 911 because my neighbor is having a loud party at 1am is not the same thing as a guy walking down the street waving a gun around, if you're saying they're both the same 911-wise, then why have a non-emergency number at all?

I think this an important clarification here since the u/Seattle_PD account has said 911 should be called for ""safety issues"" and to report ""crimes in progress"" but then u/AmericanDerp links to a post where you seem to be advocating calling 911 to report having a picture of a kid doing graffiti many hours previously - a situation where a crime is neither in progress nor is there a safety issue, seems like prime non-emergency number territory to me.

"Its not enough just to have a skill, or that skill be something worthwhile. For high pay you need to have a skill which difficult to attain, thereby limiting the pool of people who have it, and driving up the wage the job can command based on supply and demand. 

Teaching is difficult, but the potential pool of applicants for the job is huge. Cardiothoracic surgery is also difficult, but there are significantly fewer people qualified to apply for the job, so they get paid a whole lot more than teachers do.

That's why service work is so poorly compensated. In theory, you can informally train almost anyone to do the job which makes any one worker very replaceable. There are also lots of service jobs, and therefore by default there is going to be larger segment of the work force in that sector of the economy.

"The reason I did not mention unions is simple, they only negotiated deals possible because of the economic circumstances at the time. They did a very good job of helping the factory workers get a bigger piece of the pie, but that's when there was no competition. Today, factory workers are competing not just against non-union labor in right to work states, but against low wage labor throughout the 3rd world. If US industry was not the profitable enterprise it was in that era, those unions would not have had the success they did then, and clearly fail to have now. Again, the period was an aberration.

As for women, clearly you realize that the upper classes represented (and still do) a small minority of the total population. So I'm not sure what your point was. Sure these women were thinking of themselves as the Nouveau riche, but that wealth was a temporary illusion. The 1950s was simply economically (but also environmentally) unsustainable lifestyle, once the post-war world economy got into gear. Today, as in the 19th and the centuries that came before, most everyone including women has to work.

"I don't think it's about the public imposing conditions just to be jerks. Can you imagine shelters where people are bringing their dogs in without massive checks and balances? Are the dogs vaccinated? Are they friendly? Are we sure there aren't people who are allergic or terrified that are staying? 

I hear the sadness of the issue but the issues are more complicated. I would imagine there if there are not already groups that can help organize fostering pet programs then that might be a good place to you could start if you wanted to have an immediate impact. 

Also, regarding substance abuse and smoking, are you suggesting that shelters should allow smoking? Or drinking/using? Do you want to stay at a shelter with users in the active throws of a meth, heroin or even alcohol addiction? Those substances don't help with depression, they trap you in it.

"I'm a transportation focused civil engineer who has worked on both SDOT and WSDOT projects (not this one though, fortunately!). Without knowing the specific project details and design considerations, it's hard to just wave away particulars of the design without royally screwing things up. 

To the author's point about this being a city street:

- It may look like a city street, but it isn't functioning like one at this location. In addition to this being a state highway, it is also a freeway access point, so the design considerations should be different than on roadways at other locations (it isn't Pike, Broadway, or Roanoke, so why treat it like it is?).

- This is a project on WSDOT property with WSDOT money not SDOT, so while WSDOT designers might (and should!) take SDOT preferences into account, they are not obligated to follow them.

- The isnt a truck route, but what percentage of traffic is actually trucks? Busses? Trucks and Busses especially need wider lanes to be safe, particularly at intersections with tight turns and non standard geometries like this one.

To the authors point about the schematic being too large: Maybe they should have printed it on a different scale so the readers could see it all. Haha. Maybe they should have reduced the number of lanes, that would result in a smaller cross section, though the vehicle capacity would suffer. That's a political decision that could be made here.

Though my personal preference is to reduce spending on highway projects in favor of fixed transit, and based on a quick glance at what the designers proposed here, the schematics, including lane widths seem to be a quite reasonable and practical design for this location and set of constraints.",,,,TripleFootNote,,,1468011700,t5_2qhad,t3_4rvl12,t3_4rvl12,30,1471299341,0,0,d54s5wt,Seattle,30,,

"You say that like they didn't have their own corresponding answer to the housing shortage at the time. Read the very last sentence of the article that is barely cut off: ""1649 new houses build for sale..."", in 1941. They had plenty of brand new houses being thrown up everywhere to meet the demand, and it still wasn't enough. I can't imagine what the economy was like in 1941, at the end of the depression but just before the war picked up, but I can't imagine that a lot of people were able to afford those houses either... just the fancy new defense workers moving into town to work the fancy new government jobs. Your grandfather was the Amazon tech worker of 1941.

The reason we have so many new condos and houses being built is because they are _needed_. Desperately. They aren't overpriced, they are meeting the market price. The price is so high because of the insane demand for housing. Seattle is rapidly changing, but as this post is exemplifying, this is nothing new. It's happened before.

"This article's claims are out of touch with the findings.

**First**:
&gt; wages likely would have increased some anyway due to Seattle's overall economy. 

This statement is backed with no evidence. Since when have low-wage employers raised wages ""due to the overall economy."" Employers never say ""welp, look at the overall economy - time to raise wages for my lowest-earning employees!"" 

If this were true, wages in the U.S. wouldn't have stagnated for the last 30 years. This point is null and void. 

**Second**:
&gt; Those who did work had fewer hours than they would have without the wage hike.

So workers are making the same or slightly more money while *working fewer hours.* This is also a victory. Having more time is incredibly valuable for many low-wage workers, who are able to use any time offsets to invest in other personal assets, training, furthering education, taking care of children or family, being healthier, etc. If they feel the need or ability to take another job with their reduced hours, it gives them that flexibility as well.

But - doing things to improve your life off the pay roll isn't factored into the GDP, so economists view these benefits as worthless. 

&gt; There can be negative effects. Increasing the minimum wage increases the costs of hiring workers. As a result, employers must accept reduced margins or customers must pay steeper prices.

No shit - child labor and slave labor were great for business too. Paying workers a living wage might be ""hard"" - but it was also ""hard"" not to use cheap or toxic materials, not to dump waste, not to create cheap or faulty products, not to lie to consumers, etc. - this is why we have certain market interventions and regulations. 

If folks working full time cannot sustain themselves, save, make investments, improve the lot of themselves or their kin, then that employer is not adequately functional and can't compete in the market. 

If using cheap labor - or destroying the environment, etc. - puts you out of business, then you're not adequately competitive.",,,,lil_vega,,,1469836392,t5_2qhad,t3_4v9fqz,t3_4v9fqz,42,1471787766,0,0,d5wl7i5,Seattle,42,,

What I keep seeing is mods talking about pre-emptive nuking instead of actual moderation--i.e. monitoring and moderating on an as-needed basis rather than prescribing conditions that supposedly prevent the need for moderating at all.

"Right....  the machine was built perfect, says the company that built that machine.  Never mind that there was a delay shipping it here due to a odd noise (there was a single web article about that published prior to it arriving in Seattle but I can't locate it anymore), later explained as being seals that were compromised before it even touched Seattle dirt. 
http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/bertharsquos-big-troubles-started-in-japan/

&gt;When workers tested the mammoth $80 million machine before it was shipped here last April, they discovered damage to the seal system and ended up taking Bertha apart for repairs.

&gt;While Bertha is having trouble with the same seals that had to be fixed in Japan, it’s unknown whether the cause of the problem is the same, said Matt Preedy, deputy administrator for the Alaskan Way Viaduct Replacement Program with the state Department of Transportation.

&gt;An expert review-panel report on the Highway 99 project, written a year ago when Bertha was still in Japan, noted that the tunnel boring machine’s builder, Hitachi-Zosen, found “a significant fault” during testing that was expected to cause delays and make it “unlikely that the TBM will be completely assembled and fully tested prior to shipping.”

&gt;Preedy said that when Bertha was being built in Japan, one of the tests performed was to turn on the motors and rotate the cutter head. That’s when testers heard a noise and took Bertha apart. They found that some parts of the machine weren’t moving properly and caused “some metal-on-metal contact and basically damaged the seal assembly for the main bearing,” Preedy said.

&gt;After discovering the problem, the manufacturer, among other actions, had to “totally repair the seal system and reassemble it and rotate it again,” he said.

&gt;The seals protect the $5 million main bearing, which enables the ring-shaped drive shaft to turn the cutter, at about one rotation per minute. ",,,,ChefJoe98136,West Seattle,,1468770393,t5_2qhad,t3_4t9zp8,t3_4t9zp8,24,1471488401,0,0,d5fp7ae,Seattle,24,,flair

"as I see it, two things can cause the housing bubble to burst.

a massive 9.0+ earthquake

tech companies finally figuring out how to make a program to code other programs and or going bust (think what happened to manufacturing in the rust belt of the Midwest, that use to be what the seattle area is like now.

Basically what can happen to cause everyone to want to leave, and/or causes everyone to not be able to afford.  Right now tons of people want to move here, mostly for the jobs, which pay well, and allow lots of people to afford ""whatever"" rent prices, which is why things are so crazy here.

So either the tech industry needs to start paying their $150k a year employees 50k a year, offshore everything they can, or use their tech to reduce their need for human workers....

Or a bigass earthquake needs to flatten the area and scare off everyone and/or destroy the area.


They can build this area for the next 50 years and it wont pop the bubble so long as there are plenty of high paying jobs and lots of people flocking here to work.  There is PLENTY of room for this city to triple in size, hell the entire peninsula could be developed, while still retaining protected lands.

"Seattle is ""wealthy white people faux-progressive Democrat liberalism."" 

Seattle has the most regressive, anti-poor tax system in the nation. 

People here are latently racist, openly afraid of poor-looking or black people, and the city has some of the worst racial inequality in the nation. 

[Black Seattleites are poorer today](http://kuow.org/post/seattles-diverse-neighborhoods-are-surprisingly-segregated), on average, than they were 15 years ago.  In Seattle, 42 percent of black people under 18 years old live in poverty, and white household income is twice that of black household income. 

In addition, as [Seattle gets richer, its black population gets poorer](http://blogs.seattletimes.com/fyi-guy/2014/11/12/as-seattle-gets-richer-the-citys-black-households-get-poorer/): Among the 50 largest U.S. cities, Seattle now has the ninth lowest income for black households.

Further, [the wealthy in Seattle are getting wealthier at a faster pace than any other U.S. city, while those in the lowest income bracket are not keeping pace](http://blog.seattlepi.com/seattlepolitics/2015/03/24/rich-get-richer-seattle-tops-income-growth-of-highest-earning-households/) - and this is exacerbating racial inequality. 

In [Seattle, black families'](http://blogs.seattletimes.com/fyi-guy/2014/11/12/as-seattle-gets-richer-the-citys-black-households-get-poorer/) household wealth in Seattle has in fact been spiraling downward for years.

"if you were renting out your property and you had people banging down your door to rent your property, but you also wanted to protect your investment would you pick:

a: person with 2 large dogs

b: younger person with no rental history

c: established individual with clean rental history


who would you pick?
people want to protect their investments. a home or an apartment building can sustain massive damage from pets, parties, or irresponsible persons who get behind on payments. landlords can take their time and pick the person who they feel will pay on time and be the most responsible tenant. being a 25 year old traveler might work against you as they might see someone who moves a lot, could potentially party, might skip out and leave damage and no way for them to collect on damages, etc.

The average person does NOT take 9 trips a day. ""nost3"" math is categorically false. The correct answer is 2-3. 

So this ""1%"" of riders crap they're spewing is a statistical lie. There's 2.8 million people right now within Sound Transit's jurisdiction.

Taking that number into account, that's 5.6-8.4 million ""trips"" per day. 

The Sound Transit 3 package would make public transportation account for ~600,000 of those rides...or 8-10% of that total ""trip"" amount per day.

It's like these people don't know what statistics are. Jesus.

EDIT: I should state that while there are 2.3 million people in Sound Transit's jusidiction, that does NOT equate to 2.3 million drivers.

"&gt;In August 2010, two years after the OxyContin crisis began in Everett, Purdue introduced a new tablet that was more difficult to turn into powder. Addicts could no longer smoke the pills, but many of them moved to heroin, which is chemically similar and cheaper.

Hence the widely accepted thought among the treatment circles that all the reformulation did was cover said pharmaco's ass for the hours to few days it took for the extraction method to reach most addicts, who in those hours and days had either done much more serious damage by trying to use the reform without extraction or had already switched to heroin.  In a screwed up sense, the 'lucky' addicts were the ones that promptly made the switch to heroin if they weren't already in a treatment program.

"&gt; can you explain what is inconsistent

Right now anything with an original source gets removed while second-hand articles stay. There was an awesome thread about a challenge for local bookstore day, and that got axed for promoting local bookstores. Sadly few people saw the thread.

A more recent example. A new transit planning app launched in Seattle. [The link to the app's website was taken down](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/4rqvpl/citymapper_finally_comes_to_seattle/) while [an article about the launch was allowed](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/4rrdqx/allinone_transportation_app_citymapper_makes_its/). I find the link to the source application *far* more useful than some blog post about it.

You also allow journalists (Jillian Rafferty and Tim Ellis immediately come to mind) to post their own work despite it being explicitly against the sub-reddit's rules. I don't mind them posting the articles, but it is an egregious violation of Rule #6 that the mods let stand. If you are going to have the rule at all, enforce it for everyone.

"I fear the echo chamber of r/seattle may be at work here. The fact is, ST3 is asking for a significant increase in taxes with no payoff for 20-25 years. That *is* a lot to ask the average person who may be retired or even dead by the time this stuff is finished.

The Seattle Times has an estimate to see what it would actually cost you each year:
http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/transportation/heres-what-youd-pay-to-build-bigger-sound-transit-network/

For me, I would pay an extra ~~$700/year~~ $410/year. My parents would pay an extra ~~$600/year~~ $320/year. That is not chump change. Especially for something that wont be finished for another 20-25 years. Now factor in all the people that don't live near the planned stops. This vote will be far closer than most on here imagine.

Edit: I think the plan is very cool and would be great, but man that is a hefty price for something that my parents will likely never actually see and I wont get to utilize until I'm retired. At least if this passes, be nice to the folks in Renton who get jack shit out of it.

Edit2: Ah yes, Down-vote because you can't stand hearing an opinion you don't share. Sorry, call it 15-25 years, as I was corrected below. For the record, I'm actually going to vote for it.

To me it is not ambiguous. At the very least, after the shooting the officer could have offered medical assistance. Instead you can see the police officer waving his gun around acting tough against a crying woman and a four year old child. I'm not against the police.

"9.08.070 Mutual combat.

A person is guilty of a misdemeanor if he engages in or provokes combat with another person or persons upon the streets, walks or other areas of the city open to the public, or upon unauthorized private areas, unless such combat constitutes regularly scheduled and sanctioned sporting events such as boxing, wrestling, or the martial arts, where safety precautions are taken to reduce serious physical injury.

(Ord. O2010-022, Added, 12/21/2010)

The Phoenix Jones incident where this law was ""invoked"" is more or less at odds with the spirit of the law itself. If either party had any serious injury it is likely that a lawsuit could have arisen from the situation as safety precautions had been foregone... thankfully nobody was a lil bitch &amp; everything worked out alright but I'm sure those cops got a good lecture about it as the clip went viral.

Fighting in the streets isn't legal, fighting on private property isn't legal, not even if both parties consent. It has to happen in an authorized location which is sanctioned to host such events... this entire law was designed to dissuade people dueling with pistols, not to encourage people to fight in public.

"Society as a whole being a functioning, healthy unit actually helps increase the welfare and livelihood of your family and mine.  Your family is not safe or well-off if there are hundreds of mentally-ill homeless people on the streets every night.  These people have a whole set of issues of which they likely did not choose to be a part of.  There are certainly people who have chosen to be homeless out of personal preference, but most people living on the streets are struggling with mental illness and addiction which they are unable to seek treatment for because they are so poor.

Go look up housing first initiatives.  They've been used heavily in very conservative states.  Do you know why?  Because in the long run they cost you, the taxpayer, way less money than having to jail these people, or pay for accidental medical care, etc.  So please, get off your high horse, realize that both political ideologies have realized housing first is the only way, and get on board.

If this is purely financial for you, remember, that as a city gets more densely populated, the value of a square foot of land keeps going up.  So if you own land (which I'm guessing you do, otherwise you wouldn't be so adamant in your beliefs), and increase in density is good for your equity on your home.

"Best explanation I've seen comes from Sol Villareal:

Initiative 123

Please vote no on this one — it’s a perfect example of what’s wrong with the citizen initiative process. Someone basically had the idea that it would be awesome if we turned the viaduct into a Highline-style park instead of tearing it down…and that’s about as much thought as has gone into this entire initiative from the time it was conceived of until now. They raised some money from a major local developer early on (who later switched sides and began supporting to No campaign instead), which allowed them to pay for a feasibility study that showed that their idea just won’t work because the viaduct is structurally unsound — which is the whole reason why the tunnel exists in the first place. Their idea now is to tear down the viaduct, then build a new elevated viaduct park, which doesn’t make any sense.

But shouldn’t we have some kind of waterfront park, you ask? Great question. The City’s way ahead of you on this one — they’ve been working around the clock since 2012 to plan and fund a massive waterfront park that will maximize Seattle’s connection to its waterfront after the viaduct comes down next year. And the kicker? Not only will it include an elevated viewpoint of the kind that I-123 is so keen on, the City’s park is literally being designed by the guy who created I-123’s inspiration, the Highline in New York…and he also thinks that I-123 is a terrible idea.

"Everybody I know of was peaceful and very unconcerned.  

Some people who passed us going the opposite direction did not or would not have noticed and I know this because I encountered a friend along the way, who did not realize we were carrying, until I pointed it out to her (in a peaceful and nonthreatening way, to the point that we were doing an open carry 2nd amendment walk).  

We did two circuits of the lake, with 2 breaks.  On the first circuit, the woman with the rifle was not with us yet.  (The rifle is an ar 15, by the way.) On the first circuit, one fellow passed by us on some wheels of some type and shook his head slightly.  Seattle has an online crime map and I checked the crime map after our walk and there were no 911 calls recorded in relation to our walk, as of about an hour ago, but there is now showing a 911 call with a reported time of 5:55 p.m. ""person with a gun.""  We were done with the walk at about 3 in the afternoon and the end point of our walk was East Greenlake beach where most people got back in their cars and left and I left the area, carrying my usual knife.  The Seattle police online crime map is updated with new calls, not when the 911 is made, but after patrol has visited the area and determined the area to be safe and ready for him to leave.  I had let 2 SPD officers know ahead of time by email and also posted at reddit about the walk.  My guess is that someone saw us about 2:30 in the afternoon and called 911, and that 911 operators placed the call as a low priority given our peaceful behavior . . . and that patrol visited the small craft center area 3 hours or so after our walk.  OR, there is SOMEONE ELSE walking about Greenlake with firearms!  If you don't know about the online crime map of Seattle, then, type in 911 incident responses map Seattle in a search engine and view the page.  In any case, no SPD patrol were concerned about us, moving at walking speed, headed counterclockwise, twice around the lake, during the time that we were there.  We spent 30 minutes or so between the 2 circuits in the area of the paddle boat rental area, which was also our starting and ending point.  We were there, resting and eating and waiting for the woman with the rifle to arrive.

SPD patrol knows me and they have figured out that I am mostly peaceful, sufficiently peaceful that I do not provoke people to violence or engage in unprovoked violence.  So it is possible that the caller said to 911, the weapons are holstered and the people are just walking, and that SPD showed up 3 hours later!  Or, maybe they showed up just after we had left and spent 60 to 90 minutes patrolling the lake on bicycle or vehicle and then decided to mark the crime with the report!

A person can request the 911 call and summary of response by a request document.  The number is 16000235673.

"They really run the gamut. Most places have very strict by laws about what you are not allowed to do that can result in eviction. Of course some of the biggest rules have to do with MARPOL or marine pollution reduction. If anyone finds someone polluting the water either with oil, fuel, or sewage, it is a crime not to report it. Dumping such things into the water can result in fines of US$ 10,000 for each offense. Those fines can be attached to the marina if there is evidence that the marina manager knowingly looked the other way or let someone get away with discharging materials overboard. Because of this, it is often one of the ""easy outs"" for marina owners to get folks who are not suitable out of their marinas. 

That being said, there are few rights of live aboards to stay. After all, the place being rented is not officially your home. Your boat is your home so it's less like being evicted from an apartment or house and more like being kicked out of a parking spot. 

The marinas that allow living on boats can be hard to find so when you find one, especially a good one, people tend to do whatever is required to stay. Not to mention that, at least in my experience, boaters have a tendency to respect their environment pretty well. After all we live with the constant fear that we may sink and we tend to develop communities that are pretty cooperative and helpful toward each other.

"Hello, 

You should submit your building to our request a building form (https://gowaveg.com/our-buildings/new-building-request/). While the size of a building is a factor it's not the main driver to enabling WaveG (fka CondoInternet) to deploy. Primarily we look at how close it is to our existing network (construction costs to get fiber there are a per foot rate), what wire infrastructure does the building have (Cat5 vs two pair etc) available to support our speeds, and resident excitement/engagement.

We have a reasonably dense network in both Fremont and Ballard and would be surprised if it was enough out of reach that we couldn't make it work.

They must be educated to the same level as whites or else what kind of society are we?  

If we don't provide an equal standard of living for the coloreds how can we look ourselves in the mirror knowing the people-of-color are out there living in a sub-standard condition?

"imo the cyclist is an entitled ass. Driver might've been slow to notice the jogger, but did what they should have in the end by giving way. Cyclist (wrongly) felt aggrieved to have to slow down because traffic in front slowed down. Imagine that, needing to slow down whilst traveling on public roads through a busy city -- obviously something no cyclist should ever have to be inconvenienced by.

In case the heavy sarcasm implies otherwise, I'm actually quite in support of biking, walking, and transit options beyond driving... but as much as drivers can be oblivious, I've seen quite some pedestrians and cyclists be just as unnecessarily confrontational and entitled (and not even always against cars, people around me have been verbally assaulted on more than one occasion while crossing the street by cyclists blowing through crosswalks, for example).

tldr: D) wrong and a jerk about it

As an aside, I don't get why people think it's okay to hit someone's car unless it's some actually serious issue. Being mildly inconvenienced because a car is temporarily partially in your path... Do these people also think it's fine to punch someone who's in their way at the grocery store?

"I think most everyone would agree that chronic homelessness is a problem in our area.  There is lots of work being done in Seattle to help these people and others that are not homeless but need some support to have housing.  A really easy way to help is to vote yes on the [upcoming housing levy](http://www.seattle.gov/Documents/Departments/Housing/Footer%20Pages/2016HousingLevy_FactSheet.pdf).  

Also realize that wealth is not a zero sum game where people are wealthy due to others being poor.  Washington's taxes should definitely be more progressive, but it's not like by buying a designer bag and a smart phone the woman you saw is making people live worse lives.  Redmond isn't some center of rent seeking fat cats.  A lot of people made a lot of money by making useful software at the right time.

"I am not a native, born in Massachusetts and moved here when I was 3 in 83. But close enough.

The Seattle I remember was unremarkable, but comforting. It felt pretty safe biking anywhere because there wasn't much traffic.

Most of the city was kinda dirty looking (grunge of the 90s) but not really in a filthy sense, more just like, shiney and new is for other cities.

When I was 6 years old I visited DC and distinctly remember telling an elevator person that I was from Seattle. He said ""what, like, Alaska?""

Capitol Hill was a relatively unremarkable neighborhood in terms of material stuff--the highlight was the Fred Meyer. But it was definitely the place to be if you were queer. Not so much any more.

University Village felt more like a crappier version of Northgate Mall. Had all these weird red metal tubes constructing everything. Similar to that Fred Meyer.

The culture has changed a lot. The city has become much more bro-ey. There are lots of people with lots of money paying questionable amounts for things that aren't really any better than they were before, and in some cases worse. Example: there is supposedly a restaraunt in pioneers square where one can buy rice porridge for about $12/bowl. Said rice porridge has always been sold at every chinese restaurant everywhere, sometimes in unlimited portions for $3. Now it is branded and sexy so its worth $9 more

In PCC you used to see people walk in without shoes all the time. It was really a granola coop.

We took a lot of pride in the notion that our sports teams were not that great but had a lot of heart.

Lake WA wasn't as clean.

If you didn't live in Seattle you didn't really go into the city unless you were gonna see a show or eat out. 

Restaurant food prices have gone up and the quality has not risen proportionally so. For example Kisaku sushi for the most part hasn't changed, but it used to be $1 per piece.

Bars are filled with young men who are convinced this and that software will save the world.

Rent in college was $980 per month for a small 4 bedroom apt total (well not including utilities and such but that's not split 4 ways). Tuition was like $800-1100/qtr

Group Health was a lot better

So many volvos....all the 280s

The bus drivers were friendlier and more helpful, nowadays they remind me more of SF bus drivers which I think are legally obligated to not talk to people. Still the bus drivers here are friendlier and more helpful than most cities.

People didn't wreck the local hiking trails as much

This subreddit got a lot more annoying and whiney once it was around 4K users

The police used to be a lot more racist, maybe they still are

Things are a lot more multicultural than they used to be but not as much as other cities

There were a lot less women in the climbing gyms and a lot less posing as well

OK, so you've done the training rides; you've scoped out the ride and have planned all your rest stops; you know where you're staying the night; you've written your packing list for yourself, your bike bag, and your luggage - but have you thought about the hour or so after the ride is over? What you do once you cross the finish line can make a big difference in how you feel for the rest of the day. So here's a suggested post-ride plan:

Over the finish line? Good job! Now...

1. First thing you do is walk your bike to the truck. Trucks leave when full. It's not a big deal to immediately load if you arrive during a peak hour (like at 2:30), but it's a much bigger deal if you're coming towards the end of the day. You want your bike at the UW when you get there, and the best way to make sure that you aren't waiting around in the wee hours of the morning for your bike to arrive is to take care of this first.
- Remove water bottle, and empty it. Take it with you.
- Remove any food that you still have that you might want, even on an emergency basis
- Load your bike
2. Walk to luggage area.
- Stash your emptied water bottle and any food, your helmet and your socks and shoes.
- Put on your sandals/flipflops.
- Get your shower items (towel, soap, shampoo) and clean clothes.
3. Get in line for the shower. Take a nice hot shower and change into your nice clean clothes. 
4. Return to luggage area. Encapsulate your dirty clothes in a plastic bag. Ditto your wet towel. Stash in your luggage
5. Go to a food stand and get real food. A strawberry sundae is just dessert. Get something more substantive: a burrito, gyro, something like that.
6. Walk to the beer garden. Get a beer. Eat your food and drink your beer. Regale your cycling companions or newly-met friends with tales of the road. 
7. Return a final time to the luggage area. Rearrange the contents such that you can take a separate bag on the bus that will contain your water bottle (refill at the cistern in the luggage area), your emergency food, and any entertainment that you have brought with you.
8. Board the bus.

If you follow this plan, you are on the bus fed, hydrated, clean, and jolly, with books to read or music to listen to, and extra food and water if necessary. With luck, your bike has already long since left Portland and will be there at the UW for you to pick up.

Note that the suggested plan requires advanced work: to take clean clothes, some extra shoes, shower items (you can rent a towel, and there's usually leftover soap in the shower, but still), plastic bags to hold dirty shorts and wet towels, and a bag for the bus.

Also note that the luggage area is not perfectly secure. They will check tags to make sure that you are carrying out your own bag, but what you do in the luggage area is not heavily monitored. Carry your smart phone, your fancy $300 sunglasses, your wallet, anything of value, with you - even into the shower truck - to avoid theft.

OK?

Now, what I think you don't want to do:

1. Ride over the finish line, and think, ""Thank God that's over""
2. Load bike on the truck
3. Get on the bus

With 10,000 STP riders, and then the usual summer weekend traffic, it doesn't take much for the traffic on I-5 to snarl.  If you just do the three steps above, you'll be on the bus, gritty with sweat and slimy with bike grease. Your stomach will be on empty. It isn't like you want to eat yet another clif bar, but you would, if you had one - but they're left all in your bike bag or in the luggage in the hold of the bus. You will be surrounded by other riders who are fed, hydrated, clean, and jolly - but you will be miserable, potentially for hours. Don't do this. Make a post-ride plan, and follow it. You'll be a happier camper.

Have a non-bus ride home? Still, pretty much follow this plan. If you're having someone pick you up, let that person know that you won't be immediately getting in the car and driving away, after going over the finish line. Clean up and fuel up. You'll just have a better return home.

Which is absurd considering that it's probably thousands of hours of police driving on empty streets and cars sitting in precinct lots.

"Funny, I have the same opinion about cars. I know there are some good drivers out there, but the jerks speak in such volumes it's hard for the good ones to compensate. And [study](http://wisconsinbikefed.org/2013/04/15/our-pr-problem-self-righteous-spandex-wearing-scofflaws/) after [study] (http://www.pri.org/stories/2015-07-18/survey-finds-bicyclists-and-motorists-ignore-traffic-laws-similar-rates)has found that drivers and cyclists ignore traffic laws at about the same rate. 

As for your argument that bikes need to pay for the roads we use--we do. The gas tax only pays for part of the road upkeep, the rest comes from general funds. As cyclist cause [exponentially less wear and tear](http://bikeportland.org/2013/11/12/do-bikes-get-a-free-ride-advocates-infographic-shows-why-not-96950) on a road than a car, that general fund we contribute to pays for our fair share. 

Most cyclists would e perfectly fine paying a fee every year if it went towards GOOD bike infrastructure. The problem is, the people who design bike lanes don't often ride bikes, so what we want and what they give us don't often line up. Hence cyclists don't use it. Like the ""protected"" bike lanes on 2ndor Roosevelt. I feel incredibly unsafe riding in them, so will usually ride in traffic instead.

Why would I need to carry bike insurance? In case I hit a pedestrian or dent a car? Well, then pedestrians would carry insurance in case they run into me. (This happens. Pedestrians don't always look when crossing roads and I've had one T-bone me.)

The US has at least 5 on it's west coast, diffusing the impact. Add to that a weak Canadian dollar, a more open immigration process, banks allegedly actively subverting currency laws, self-regulation in the real estate industry until just last week, relatively restrictive development laws regarding sprawl and land use, and Vancouver is uniquely weighted towards housing issues due to outside currency.

"The problem with the zipper merge is that for it to work effectively and as intended you need a critical mass of drivers knowledgeable in the concept and it's application. Anything less than that and the system still will not work as designed.

The region for decades has been raised up on the concept of ""wait your turn"". It's not something that can be erased overnight. /u/ChefJoe98106 has a good point about the merge arrows and signage. It does encourage getting over early, which to be fair, seems like the responsible thing to do, and has probably helped indoctrinate the long queue mentality.

However for on-ramps, it's more complicated. There were a few articles that discussed it (one of them can be found [here](http://www.thenewstribune.com/news/local/article25870837.html)) Basically under RCW 46.61.195 ""the vehicle entering the arterial must yield the right of way to the vehicle which is already on the arterial."" In other words, while we have backed up lanes at on ramps as cars merge into traffic now, they do so because the cars in the arterial allow them to, but those drivers are technically under no legal obligation to do so. Someone can't race up to the end of the on-ramp and demand to be let in, from a legal standpoint.

"The Federal ADA law covers pushbuttons in a supplemental document called the PROWAG, or Public Right-of-Way Accessibility Guidelines. 

The plain old mushroom pushbutton (lower right pic) is being phased out in favor of APS pushbuttons (APS stands for Accessible Pedestrian Signal).  APS pushbuttons have vibrotactile features and voice features to provide wayfinding and guidance to persons with visual disabilities.

It is not a matter of ""contractors bidding per their supplier"", or ""using up a pile of older models"".  

For a brand new traffic signal or crossing, the law is clear.  All pushbuttons must be APS pushbuttons.  

But the Federal guidelines are less clear when it comes to upgrading and performing maintenance or repairs on an existing signal.  So the agency maintaining the signals will set their own policy.  It is up to the Traffic Engineer in charge of the traffic / signals department to make and set that policy.  

APS are also installed upon request, if a visually disabled person makes a particular crossing (say, on their way to/from work every day) the agency may opt to install APS at that intersection or, less usual, at just that crossing at the intersection.  

Without knowing more about each case you took photos of, and what the City policy is I cannot say why the City opted to install APS vs. non-APS pushbuttons at the intersections you saw.  

The rule-of-thumb where I am is that we never mix APS and non-APS pushbuttons at the same traffic signal or crossing beacon.  If an old non-APS mushroom head fails, it's replaced with another non-APS pushbutton.  But the entire system is gradually being refitted with all APS pushbuttons.  

There are several manufacturers making ADA-compliant APS pushbuttons, so that will account for some minor differences in the units you see.  

Why a non-APS pushbutton was installed on a new-looking signal pole is mysterious.  The question is, is that just one new pole at an existing traffic signal, and the rest of the poles are older, and were not changed?  Or is it a completely new signal system with new poles all the way around?  

You can contact SDOT's traffic engineer, his name is Dongho Chang (@Dongho_Chang on Twitter), provide him with the intersection address, and ask him why a non-APS pushbutton was installed.  ",,,,Dr_Adequate,,,1469281945,t5_2qhad,t3_4u68vn,t3_4u68vn,17,1471625105,0,0,d5nltp8,Seattle,17,,

"Honestly,its cheaper to buy a bottle of rain x from a car store. It's pretty cheap. Cheaper than a single car wash,but lats longer. 

I worked at brown bear car wash in past time. Do you have a nice car? I really do not suggest automatic washes. I will only speak from my location. We wash the brushes morning and night. During summer months,there was obscene amounts of sand pitted after we washed off thr brushes.like...a lot, enough to take an hour to clean away.. I couldn't fathom what a less busy wash looks like (say a gas station wash or similar). My bosses always promoted swirl/scratch free. But its unlikely. We had people complIn about swirl marks all the time. We laughed st people bringing in their new zO6 corvette. Its easy to tell a newer ish Audi that gets regular washes. Look at their paint. It looks aged. It shouldn't.

To someone who isn't aware- be aware. A lot of kids will not pay attention to antennas,stickers,traioer hitches, or antenna balls. They will be swiped away or hit your car. Also, just because you're in an automated wash,doesn't mean you're safe. Nearly once or more a day I had a vehicle accidently pull off neutral (or never be in neutral at all) and accidently hit the vehicle in the front. Which then the vehicle in the back hits.

"&gt; Washington’s treasurer wants to implement a flat state income tax to fund schools.

A progressive income tax would be much more equitable and beneficial over the long-run. 

Since we have extremely high inequality, a flat tax ignores declining marginal utility of income as we get to the top tax brackets. WA ranks [14th](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_by_GDP) for GDP, [15th](http://www.usgovernmentrevenue.com/federal_revenue_by_state.php) for Federal tax generation, but 35th in state tax burden. 


Our [outdated and heavily regressive current tax system](http://www.thestand.org/2015/02/washingtons-tax-system-unfair-and-outdated/) places disproportionate burden on the lowest earners - and a flat tax that taxes the poorest at the same rate as our wealthiest does nothing to fix this. 

Further, [the wealthy in Seattle are getting wealthier at a faster pace than any other U.S. city, while those in the lowest income bracket are not keeping pace](http://blog.seattlepi.com/seattlepolitics/2015/03/24/rich-get-richer-seattle-tops-income-growth-of-highest-earning-households/) - and this is exacerbating inequality. 

Seattle has one of the [lowest average tax burdens](http://www.thestand.org/2015/02/washingtons-tax-system-unfair-and-outdated/) of any major city in the nation, and the [*most regressive*](http://www.seattletimes.com/business/economy/washington-suffers-most-regressive-tax-system-in-u-s/) tax system. 

Our over-reliance on regressive sales taxes has been shown to lead to [declining state tax revenue growth](http://www.king5.com/story/news/local/2014/09/15/washington-sales-tax-wealth-gap/15658825/) and increasing income [inequality](http://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2024548711_taxreportxml.html), with an unequal distribution of funding for public goods like public schools and services. 

In addition, Washington is one of only [two states](http://www.washington.edu/news/2014/09/18/poverty-income-inequality-increase-in-washington-state/) that saw increases in BOTH poverty and inequality in 2014, and structural factors like poor funding of public goods (such as schools) is part of the story.

But, to what end? Almost all the stuff cut from those original plans is now incorporated in future plans. So why are we bullshitting around and taking the chance of paying more exorbitant costs in the future for the things we want now?

There is a reason that NYC leads the world in cost/mile for mass transit: the cost and bureaucracy of building new rail in a dense urban core with constantly rising property values is insane. Contrast that with a place like Denver, where they are able to throw some track down in the middle of nowhere and have a low cost intercity light rail.  We cannot afford to deny that Seattle is a densifying, expensive city with no sign of stopping. Our geography and population growth dictate a traffic problem that is only going to get worse.

"I feel bad for Nick Collison, who was one of my favorite Sonics and stood up for Seattle even after the move. Other than that? I feel bad *in theory* for OKC fans, who I don't blame for anything other than perpetuating the myth that the Sonics left because Seattle didn't want them. But ultimately those fans were gifted a team with Durant, Westbrook, Jeff Green and Serge Ibaka - they haven't really had to endure true hardship yet. This is an introduction to the ups and downs that come with sports fandom. 

I feel no remorse whatsoever for Clay Bennett and OKC ownership. Their karmic wheel has turned - now they know what it feels like to be abandoned by something they love. I'm thrilled for Kevin Durant for obvious reasons, and for the Golden State fans, who were some of the best and most knowledgeable fans in the NBA for decades despite having a consistently bad team.

"While it does sound like there was some internal friction with the admin and faculty at play, this still really irks me.

Students that are so overzealous when it comes to inclusion/culture/*their feelings* that they are actively silencing others without even realizing it is very disturbing.

SU has further re-enforced the idea for these children that *feelings* and how one internally reacts to the actions of others matters more than the actions themselves. 

A half-assed sit-in (you took shifts! such a sacrifice.) over *book curriculum* that immediately jumped to demanding the dean be removed? Get over yourselves, kids. Not taking no for an answer and demanding only to be taught what you want to hear is pretty much the exact opposite of what college is supposed to be: critical thinking, exposure to new ideas and ways of thinking.

"&gt; no payoff for 20-25 years

Not entirely true. SeaTransBlog has been covering ST3 delivery [here](http://seattletransitblog.com/2016/07/13/sound-transit-3-the-first-five-years-2019-2024/), [here](http://seattletransitblog.com/2016/07/15/sound-transit-3-the-main-body-2030-2036/), and [here](http://seattletransitblog.com/2016/07/18/sound-transit-3-final-and-ongoing-projects-2039-2041/).

To recap the next couple of decades:

* 2021: Northgate Link comes online (ST2)
* 2019-2024: various regional bus improvements
* 2023: East Link and Lynnwood Link come on line (ST2)
* 2024: Link to Redmond, Link to Federal Way, SR522 BRT to 145th Link, I-405 BRT
* 2030: Link to West Seattle and Link to Tacoma
* 2031: infill stations at 130th, Graham St, and Boeing Access Road
* 2035: new Downtown transit tunnel and Link to Ballard
* 2036: Link to Everett
* 2039: Tacoma Link extended, 
* 2041: Link to Izzy and South Kirkland

This is still a preliminary timeline. Things can move around based on how municipalities cooperate and federal funding comes in. Note Angle Lake Station was set to open in 2023 with Kent-Des Moines Road Station but was accelerated to 2016 with federal money.

"A message from his brother: 

&gt; Hello,
&gt; 
&gt; My younger brother, William (Will) Felix, age 20, has been missing since Saturday. We have a large family, he is number 13 of 14 kids, I am the oldest and we are all doing what we can to find him. He is a student at Western but found out he recently dropped out of his classes and did not pay his rent for the last few months. He has never done this before (he is an Eagle scout and has had no trouble before). His friends say his camping gear is gone from his room, that he may have had a large amount of cash on him and may have gone to Seattle or the San Juans or the mountains. He left a suicide note but we feel more like he may be running from something. The police case number is 16B31981 with the Bellingham police department.
&gt; We would appreciate your help in helping to spread his picture and our concern for him.
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you,

&gt; Uber has undertaken a number of initiatives to convince Seattle drivers not to support the newly empowered App Based Drivers Association.

&gt; While Uber took no public position while the Seattle ordinance was being debated, it lobbied heavily behind the scenes and released a number of studies favorable to Uber while the bill was being considered.

"Rent control is like global warming in that every person with a basic grasp of the issue is on one side of the debate.

Rent control means prospective builders won't be able to get as much money for putting up new housing. They'll just pass and build somewhere else where they can make more money. Meanwhile, the owners of existing properties have little incentive to fix or maintain their properties since there's less competition. So you get a situation where there are fewer housing options and the ones that exist are poorly kept.

It's not like a light switch though and doesn't happen immediately after rent control is passed. But it is an inevitable outcome. If you want lower housing costs, increase housing supply.

"Some issues from this article:

&gt; but wages likely would have increased some anyway due to Seattle’s overall economy.

I'm calling outright bullshit on this hypothetical.

&gt; Meanwhile, although workers were earning more, fewer of them had a job than would have without an increase.

I could actually see this, but:

&gt; Those who did work had fewer hours than they would have without the wage hike.

*I do not believe that both of these statements are true*. For example: A business that is open 9 hours a day for 5 days a week has to have someone operating it for 45 hours. You need an amount of minimal labor to operate. Anything extra is redundancy. So there's the following cases:

1) Not hiring, not firing: The same people are doing the same work for more money. Their wages have increased.  
2) Not hiring, firing: Some of the same people are doing the same work for more money. Either the business identified redundancies and optimized for that *or* they have made a poor decision and are instead harming the customer experience by reducing their capacity.  
3) Not hiring, shifting resourcing: The business has rebalanced hourly workers such that they are shifting the equation by which each employee now works some lower maximum number of hours and a salaried worker picks up the difference. This is sinking the wages of the hourly employees into the salaried employees' - essentially wage theft if the salaried employee works over their contracted hours.  

Assuming the second was true then that's the point and a gain. An employee going from working at $9.96 to $11.14 has gained a 11.8% in hourly income. Thus they can work 10.6% hours less to maintain their current wage level (100 hours at $9.96 is equivalent to 89.4 hours at $11.14) - assuming benefits haven't been cut, but let's be fair hourly employees have been getting screwed in the benefits game for years. ***This is good***.

"I'm not sure when the REI heyday was, but it certainly hasn't been any of the last 5-7 years.  Once upon a time REI employees typically had first-hand relevant knowledge of what they were selling, which made the slightly higher prices far beyond worthwhile.  If you wanted to be left alone they would leave you alone.  If you wanted answers they were quick with first hand knowledge.  If someone wasn't familiar enough to answer a question they would find someone that could.

Today, meaning for the last several years, finding someone that really knows what they are talking about there is like finding a unicorn.  At some point REI seems to have decided that the big-box store approach to staffing was the way to go.  If I want Amazon reviews parroted to me, I'll just buy the item on Amazon.  Keep the register and similar jobs for employees that could just as easily work at Target/Lowes/whatever but bring back the floor staff that actually knew what they were talking about (while providing the opportunity for the former to become the latter like you used to do).

Yeah, you could go extra fast for a spell but then you'd need to wait minutes for some idiocy and miss lights. 

Since it went two lanes with a turn lane I can go pretty much non-stop barring lights the length of 35th at around 30mph.

Convenient. No need to leave outside to get stolen. Bring in with you while shopping, eating, etc.

"I love the idea that Baby Boomers somehow are the root of all evil. The Baby Boomers simply happened to be the last generation to spend most of their working lives in the fantasy land that was the United States economy post WWII until the oil shocks of the early 1970s. Europe and Japan were in rebuilding mode and many other countries were hamstrung by totalitarian/collectivist regimes, so there was very little competition, and the labor participation rate was very high.

This experience gave Boomers a slightly warped view of reality, but every generation that preceded them had ideas about economics that were at least as fucked up as those espoused by current politicians. See the Great Depression, and consider that depressions used to happen every 10 years, on average, before the Federal Reserve was established.

Prior to the 1940s, most people died within 5-10 years of retirement, so entitlements weren't the weapons of mass destruction that they have become now.

Spoiler alert: [Millennials don't seem to have significantly better ideas than Boomers](http://www.inquisitr.com/3193459/bill-maher-slams-millennials-over-false-socialism-views-video/) when it comes to managing the economy.",,,,SoyIsMurder,Greenwood,,1469672593,t5_2qhad,t3_4uv9nf,t1_d5tqgvy,14,1471741433,0,0,d5twmlw,Seattle,14,,flair

"The 1950s and to a lesser extent the 60s were an economic aberration created by the post World War II destruction of all the industrial competitors the US had at that time. Without competition for American goods by European and Japanese manufacturers, and with the USSR economically hobbled by the war and communism, demand for American made goods was very high and therefore manufacturing labor could command outsized wages.

Moreover, the idea of single earner households is also a historical aberration. Through much of the 19th century, the US (and most everyone else) were predominantly agrarian societies where everyone worked, men, women and children. The stay at home non-income earning mom of the 1950s was an anomaly, not the pinnacle of historical domestic wifely leisure.

But anyway, those manufacturing jobs still exist, they're just called programmers now, and their product is code. There is also good income to be made in healthcare, real estate, investing, the law, and small business ownership. I don't think that competing for low skill low wage jobs with countries like China and India is going to advance our economic fortunes.

"I'm 51 and lived in Seattle my entire life.

The current Seattle and the Seattle of my childhood in the 70s are so entirely different that there's almost no basis to compare them.

It looks different.  The economy is different.  The culture is different.  The people are different.  The food is different.

The town I grew up in was a cheap, economically marginal place where most jobs were blue collar.  If people were ambitious or wanted to make money, they had to go somewhere else.  Hardly anyone outside of Seattle had even heard of the place.  It remember getting a lot of ""Is that in Canada?"" type comments.

The current rich, bustling, boomtown with conspicuous wealth and tremendous poverty on the same block would be unrecognizable to my younger self.

A lot of the change has been positive, but I sometime miss the weird logging town of the 70s and 80s.  I'd like to go back there for a visit, but it doesn't exist any more, which is a little sad.

"People seem to have ""non-profit"" confused with ""free"" in this thread. There's nothing stopping a non-profit organization from charging a lot of money for the services they offer. As long as the non-profit has the documentation to back up the fact that they're putting all of their revenue back into the services they provide and the people they pay - and not for simply making profits for the organization as a whole - they're good to go.

My personal experience is with many long-term care facilities in Seattle (and elsewhere of course). They're usually really expensive, because the land on which they're built is super expensive, and they offer extremely high-quality food and good conditions and healthcare for their residents. But the money that the residents pay to be there goes directly back into improving the facility and paying for the services and the people who work there. So it's a facility that ""makes"" tens or hundreds of millions of dollars per year, but it's not actually profiting from that money.

"Tech Smuck on the ground here.  In many ways Amazon is the New Microsoft.  

In the 1990s, Microsoft was big and powerful, yet still riding a wave of growth upward to even bigger and even higher stock prices, adding people right and left and expanding outward.  The growth masked some of the internal issues: The culture Koolaid, long work hours, internal politics and review dynamics and employee retention that were glossed over by many employees as long at the overall boat was rising with the stock tide and they got their chance to make an above average salary and possibly a big financial score.

Today I think you can say something very similar about Amazon.  I've met many people who have started at Amazon in the past 3 years, and to them it is a better financial opportunity, but comes at the price of working their tails off in a very cut-throat environment where they are harshly measured based on productivity and cut and culled ruthlessly at times.  Those are some of the reasons the average tenure there is so short.  It's not a place that values keeping anyone not in the upper echelons there a long time, but the survivors sometimes see life-improving financial windfalls.

As for Bezos personally?  I don't know him, but I've heard stories.   As the founder leader/dictator, he sets the tone and the tempo for the company culture and an entourage of surrounding yes-men carry it out, much lake Gates and Balmer did.

"Ghettoside is in my opinion the best book ever written about the crime problem in urban America. Conservatives like to see the black areas of the US as hopeless ganglands which will never change until black people ""stop killing each other"" and ""fix their own problems"". Liberals like to pretend that higher rates of black crime don't exist, or, in an entertaining twist, recently started blaming those disparities on the criminal justice system. The entire conversation is poisoned by outright racism on one side and a refusal to acknowledge real problems on the other.

Ghettoside really answers the question of ""why do so many black people get shot?"" with a pretty obvious answer: When someone kills a black man in America, they probably will get away with it, and that's been the case for literally centuries. The clearance rate for murders of black men is nationally is around 40%. In places like Chicago and Baltimore it's even worse. When there's no consequence for shooting someone, more people get shot. That shouldn't be really surprising.

Notably, in Seattle SPD has a homicide clearance rate of aorund 80%. And while we still have disparities, our murder rate is a lot lower than other major cities in America.

"The motive was, IMO, jealousy and control on Dr. Chen's part.

Eric Cooper was 17 when he ran away from home to be with a 27-year-old Dr. Chen (he finished his GED and got a college degree later), and he didn't have much of a life of his own after that. His whole life was dedicated to supporting Dr. Chen, moving around for him and staying focused on him. 

Essentially, Cooper grew up and around the time Chen and Cooper decided to move to Seattle from Durham, NC, they also in essence broke up. But, they moved to Seattle together and had plans to co-parent their little boy. However, I'm not sure Dr. Chen ever really wanted that and I also think it's fair to say that Dr. Chen really couldn't handle the idea of Cooper doing his own thing in a city with a lot of opportunities for a gay man. I really do think jealousy and control was the motive and I'm not the only one who thinks that.

"People old enough will recall that he was once the head gardener at Seattle University in the 1990s.  A lot of the one of a kind and odd eclectic mix of plants around campus are thanks to him, or were.  He quit one year over the Administrations not being willing or interested in him running a gardening show while simultaneously being the head of campus landscaping - they thought this would be a conflict of interest.

So he said I quit and went on to fame and glory as King5's Gardening with Ciscoe, as well as being available to other big institutions like the Mariners when asked, kind of a senior gardening consultant for those really tough questions.

Ironically, the new team at SU were all trainees / people he'd hired, so they called him in plenty of times to deal with difficult questions.  So he wound up not only doing better on TV, but being paid consulting on retainer at SU.

I'm sorry I've run afoul of the ""pot cures everything"" crowd, but I'm a working scientist and there's simply not enough good studies to say much of anything, and coupled with the fact that people swear it cures cancer, depression, anxiety, seizures (which can be different etiology), acne, obesity etc you've got to have some skepticism. Even the clinical trial you linked isn't that impressive, it warrants more research but essentially all of this is very early stuff - and if you were better familiar with how drug development works you'd realize this stuff is a long way off from really being useful. 


edit:

&gt;I work as a game dev and will definitely show this to my co workers.


It's so surprising to me that you're not a scientist! I totally thought you were based on your ability to uncritically link studies you probably found on a pro-medical-pot site!

"Proposing to abolish property taxes won't assist WA's lowest income populations, it will do the opposite. the sales tax reduction is only by 1%. King County residents will still pay 8.5% combined sales tax in addition to now paying 5% across the board in income taxes with the only real benefit to the wealthier residents who can afford to purchase property. I say raise the property tax to 3-5% on any dwelling that's not a primary domicile, while keeping the current millage rate for primary residences, reduce the sales tax by 1-2% and keep no income tax.

According to US census data, there are currently about 2.8 million people in Washington over the age of 16, and the US Bureau of Labor and Statistics indicates a national, seasonally adjusted average employment-to-population ratio of 59.6%, and the Washington unemployment rate falls right in line with the national unemployment rate, so we'll go by those numbers, meaning 1.63 million employed people in the state of Washington.

The Washington per-capita personal income as of 2015, according to the Office of Financial Management is $51,146, so the Washington gross income would average about $83.5 billion. Factoring out the bottom 10% of earners for earned income deductions, we have net tax revenue of about $3 billion from the proposed plan, mostly from the working and lower middle classes. A lot of the savings that the lowest classes see will end up offset by increased rent, since the lack of property tax will lead to increased speculation.

If we instead consider raising property taxes on speculation, we can raise this amount with the majority of the tax burden falling towards speculators, which also helps to discourage rampant speculation and help rein in ballooning property values, to bring the region to a more sustainable level of growth. According to the Washington Department of Revenue, there were $10.3 billion dollars in levies against property in 2015 in Washington state, with King County leading the way at $4.1 billion. 63.1% of homes in Washington are owner occupied according to the census, leaving us with approximately 37% of homes that are tenant occupied and owned by speculators. I wasn't able to find figures on the break down of property taxes from commercially zoned versus residentially zoned buildings, but if an even split is assumed (which seems to be the case in other studies that I've found), then 18.5% of that $10.3 billion dollars, or $1.90 billion, was generated from speculated property, with an average property tax rate of around 1%. If the tax rate for speculation were tripled to 3%, we'd then see an additional $3.8 billion in tax revenue from those sources, $800 million more than would be generated by a state income tax.

Arguments against my proposal might state that the rental market wouldn't be able to sustain such a shift, but I'd point them to several major Canadian cities, which currently sustain tax ratios of up to 4:1 for commercially owned properties versus owner occupied.

Documents from the Office of Financial Management already show that the lowest income populations pay the most in aggregated state and local taxes already, with the lowest 10% paying nearly 4.5 times as much in taxes as the highest earning 10%, and the proposal of the Treasurer would only increase that burden.

An additional benefit to this plan would be that holding onto land for speculative purposes would no longer be as profitable, so we might actually see some increase in development in some rundown or decrepit areas of the state.",,,,GodMonster,,,1469785950,t5_2qhad,t3_4v2w73,t1_d5v6uh1,10,1471772380,0,0,d5vp53d,Seattle,10,,

"Okay, the last time this was brought up was a puff piece from the Seattle Times about a restaurant.  It had no substance, no info, wasn't even a review, it was basically a promotional piece taken straight from the restaurant's PR.  

I straight up asked /u/careless if the exact same (word for word) article would be allowed if it was posted on a random blog.  His response was that ""moderators don't have the time to read every blog, we allow established journalistic sources.""  He went on to tell me the fact the article was poop was irrelevant, since it got heavily downvoted.

Now lets make this entirely clear, because it's blatant how biased this is:

**I am a professional food critic with a blog**.   I do professional reviews, but also run an amateur blog where I talk about interesting markets in the city, cool new trends I see, what's overhyped, food carts, just generally anything that pops into my mind.  This blog?  **Banned**

**I also write a column for the Seattle Times**.  One of my blog posts is pretty good, I like it.  I turn it in as an article.  It becomes an article in the Times.  **Allowed**


This is blatantly fucking nuts.  It's completely fucking nuts.  Saying that it's not obvious favoritism towards traditional media sources and away from the very blogs and other interesting sources that Reddit was designed to cast light on is untenable.

There was no increase in zoning for 20k more housing units. Later when it became clear it was amazon moving in, and the job estimate jumped to 60k they all broke their hands patting themselves on the back. Still no new zoning.

Everything that people complain about now is just downstream fallout. When all the new hires decided to live in the city, because of lack of inventory, prices soared. Developers wanted to build new units, but again lack of inventory due to shitty zoning made options limited so they bid up what few properties could be built high rise, raising prices.

Now the market is broken, the collectivists want developers to build, or pay for via taxes, cheap units, but they can't the resources where they made sense are gone they got bid up in the rush.

"Did I hear someone say ""armchair engineer""??? Real Action Engineer (RAE) to the rescue!

Let's first discuss lane widths. ""Standard"" straight travel lanes are about 11'. Wider lanes along curbs are typical to accommodate bus stops, freight trucks, and turns. Metro likes wider lanes so large buses have room to maneuver and turn without hitting curbs, planters, other vehicles, etc. That 15' turn lane at the top with the painted buffer, for example, is Metro's turn lane onto EB520 and will likely be used by route such as the 271 and 540. Anything on that diagram with a diamond or ""bus only"" will see bus traffic and possibly bus stops, so it'll be a bit wider. It's normal to use slightly wider lanes for vehicles turning to accommodate overhang and swing of vehicles like UPS and moving trucks (note how the two left turn lanes onto WB520 in the roadway's center widen from 12' on tangent to 14.5' and 15' in the curve). A 53' semi-truck (aka [WB-67](http://design.transportation.org/Documents/TurnRadii,GreenBook2004.pdf) PDF!) would have a hell of a time in here but it may fit assuming the poor driver gets creative . Engineers change ""standard"" things for reasons such as lane use, geometry, turning movements, turning types, ROW availability, and more. That's part of the job.

Secondly is behavior. Wider lanes indeed make people drive faster, but on either side of this interchange lanes go back to being very narrow. 9.5' on that south end is about as narrow as we can make a lane. And there are ""refuge"" medians to break up two of the longer pedestrian crossings.

Third is the number of lanes. While this thing appears enormous east-to-west, several of these lanes are for turn storage to move vehicles out-of-the-way to wait for left turns while other vehicle go straight or make other movements. This helps improve efficiency of an intersection, speeds up transit, and hopefully will unclog parts of it. Today, cars spill out of turn lanes and block the entire roadway; which is of no use to anyone. Additionally, I see many opportunities for ""no turn on red"" signage, which would help prevent cars turning during pedestrian phases.

Fourth, people biking and walking. A *significant* effort to create a network of paths and trails to ensure folks have a safe way to get around and can avoid the interchange. And if they cannot, there are wide sidewalks and a friggin nice covered lid to walk over. Check out this [beastly map](http://1p40p3gwj70rhpc423s8rzjaz.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/2015_0116_SR520DesignReport_11x17-overviewmap.jpg). Specifically, the orange and yellow lines, points 16, 35, and 36, and SDOT's Greenways.

Finally, I'd ask ""ok, what else are we to do?"" This is part of a $4 billion freeway project trying to right many wrongs with much more urban-friendly design than any other project around. We're adding a significant regional bike path, many walking paths, HOV lanes, restoration of the Aroboretum, and two very nice lids. I recommend taking a bus to the Evergreen Point Freeway Station to get a sample of what this thing will look like.

"I worked in retail/retail management for nearly 8 years before finishing school and moving into academic science. The dismissive tone that many people in this thread and in the wider world take towards retail employees is infuriating. There's this assumption that because the individual isn't working in an office that they're; worth less, dumber, deserve to be poor etc. The truth is that a lot of ""real jobs"" don't require any more brains than helping customers and stocking shelves, and often include a lot more free time (as evidenced by the number of people with plenty of time to comment on reddit threads during the work day). 

People with this attitude come into retail places and treat the employees like dirt. Then when these same workers get some kind of idea to  better their situations, it's all ""well they should just get better jobs"" and the implied ""like me"" is almost audible. There were times during my retail career where the self control I needed to stop myself from physically attacking a Microsoft HouseWife (this species found at University Village) were almost inhuman. 

A capitalist economic system encourages people to think of worth as dollars in, as if your shitty office job where you send barely literate emails to other mouthbreathers makes you more worthy of a home and food. Ultimately, the jokes on all of us - there are fewer and fewer kinds of jobs that lead to what we'd call a ""middle class"" life, but we're never going to effect the kind of change necessary to face an increasingly automated future if members of the ""slightly better off but still could be fucked"" classes refuse to recognize their natural allies in the working class.

"There's a bit more to it than that.

The 2nd Ave bike lane had a long history of serious crashes and injuries, all tied to the same basic design flaw, putting through traffic (southbound bikes) to the left of left-turning drivers.

City code says drivers turning across bike lanes must yield to bicycles in the bike lane.  But the design of the bike lane may have made that impossible -- prosecutors would have had to prove that the driver *could* have seen the cyclist.  No amount of legislation makes photons pass through steel, trucks have huge blind spots, and the city knew that big trucks would be making left turns from next to the substandard-width bike lane.

So the city violated accepted standards to build a substandard bike lane to the left of left-turning traffic.  It did nothing to warn drivers of the hazard.  And it got hundreds of reports of collisions and near-collisions in the years the bike lane was there.  

With that background, it would have been very hard to make charges stick against the truck driver.

The cyclist was following the rules to the letter, riding in the bike lane at a reasonable speed, expecting other users of the street to follow the rules, too.  Then the truck turned without yielding to traffic already in the bike lane.

That's what puts the city on the hook here -- if two users, both following the rules to the best of their ability, collide, the problem is with the rules or the facility, not the users.

Given the years-long record of crashes and the well-documented engineering defects, I'm not surprised the city was eager to pay for the problem to go away before trial.

People that own/rent places typically have a source of income (job, private business, trust fund baby, lottery, etc.). They pay taxes.

The saying ""don't bite the hand that feeds you"" may be old and tired it's also still valid and accurate. LEO's enjoy having a paycheck; supplied by taxes. That person helping to repave the road also needs a paycheck; supplied by taxes. City Council members receive an income; paid for with taxes. There's a large number of people getting paid by taxes; most of which realize that employed residents pay for their salary. Unfortunately homeless people pay very little to none of these taxes that are required to pay for gov't services. Now granted my family doesn't directly pay income tax.

"Summary:

&gt;Gray said that the operational threshold is “a 150-year return period seismic event. If an earthquake like Nisqually happened again, Link could remain operational with minimal disruption as long as the tracks were clear and we were able to maintain power to the system.”

And 

&gt; It’s designed to avoid major failure and maintain life safety after the worst earthquake that experts can predict will happen every 2,500 years or so. Is this scenario Link would likely not be operational because of track blockages or power disruptions but the infrastructure would be standing. Backup systems would be able to power fire/life/safety systems in our underground stations but they would not be able to power the line.

Summary summary:

A ""150 year"" quake shouldn't disrupt the system much at all.

A ""2,500 year"" quake shouldn't damage the system but outside issues could disrupt service. Emergency systems are designed to withstand such a quake and underground passengers would not be in danger.

The key word is tolerance. You don’t have to be speaking in favor of gay marriage or you don’t have to be pro-choice — but just don’t go out and campaign on these issues"". And a little further down he says how everybody wants to be rich and the Republican party can't survive if people ignore them when they talk about hating on people.

He's essentially saying he has no intention of catering to the ideals of any of the demographics the Republican party has failed to attract so far. But he's encouraging the party to sweep their controversial points under the metaphorical rug and hope these people are greedy enough to blindly respond to ""won't somebody think about the economy(children)?!"" without actually explaining what the plan is, long enough to get more votes.

Downtown was a bit tawdry. Pine Street was a ""war zone"" of porno theaters and sex workers. The donut shop on First and Pike was where pimps would recruit teenage runaways for their businesses. As a teenage female, I learned to recognize these guys and fend them off.

First Ave was all pawn shops and army-navy surplus stores.

So some of these stories are almost certainly bullshit, but I believe that there is a real hole (not bottomless though).

People would use it as an illegal dump. If you threw something in there you'd hear it bounce off the walls once or twice and then... nothing. A guy cast 15 miles of line off his fishing pole and never hit bottom. Another one of the legends says some guy threw his dead dog down there and the next day saw the dog alive, running around near the hole. Apparently the guy who talked about it on Coast to Coast was talked to by government officials who persuaded him to move to Australia or something. Probably just some crazy guy looking for attention though.

"Causation =/ Correlation;

Your statement citing that SP link claims "" research found that regressive taxes allow for increased accumulation of wealth at the top of income brackets while disproportionately taxing the lowest incomes "", meaning that states with progressive income taxes across all income tiers would neutralize or decrease the inequality of the increased accumulation of wealth at top, reducing tax burden on lowest, etc.

Yet when you look at New York State, with a respectable progressive income tax rate for tiered incomes, we find that:

In 2013, income inequality was much higher in many states, metropolitan areas, and counties than for the United States overall. In 2013 the top 1 percent of families nationally made 25.3 times as much as the bottom 99 percent.

Nine states had gaps wider than the national gap. In the most unequal states—New York, Connecticut, and Wyoming—the top 1 percent earned average incomes more than 40 times those of the bottom 99 percent.

http://www.epi.org/publication/income-inequality-in-the-us/

What's great about this contradiction is I've found numerous others, but I'm lazy and don't need to type this out.

Also, you will need to clarify what is income versus what is accumulation of wealth. These are different things; someone can have 100,000 dollars in taxable investments and make a 22.3% return in 2010, 29.8% return in 2011 and 33.6% return in 2012 (my own rates of return, mind you!), so over 3 years my income from a taxable investment alone is 0 - there was no sale of asset or capital gains event. Yet, my accumulation of wealth was awesome.

The more we dig into the weeds the uglier it gets. 

You want tax revenue. What can local city, county and state government do with these taxes to increase incomes and reduce inequality? Because I have bad news for you - if I have a series of taxable and tax-exempt investments, as a high income earner/saver, I'm going to keep winning and winning - that's a Federal (capital gains, progressive vs. flat, long vs. short) debate. THAT is where most ""income"" and ""wealth accumulation"" growth and inequality ultimately comes from, NOT base salaries.

Base salaries per region / city are in line with COL in that area; Example, Bellevue and Everett have different median incomes per person / per family.

tl;dr : The Game is rigged, making more money will make you more money, what will taxes do to increase ACTUAL incomes (base salaries/hourly wages) when business has the incentive to pay as little as possible? Government can't tell business to pay more outside of minimum mandates, which are already horrific. 15$/ hour part &amp; full time is not at all a livable wage, Seattle.

The opening line even misidentifies the American soccer demographic.

What a joke.

Seattle enters his scathing review of American soccer fandom, seemingly only because it was the only soccer event the author has ever been to.

"First of all, it's a little hyperbolic to claim a protest march is ""interrupting the livelihood of a city"". Most protests pose a temporary inconvenience to those in the vicinity, but I don't think most, if any, ""livelihoods"" are meaningfully interrupted. I think it would take days/weeks of continuous protests to actually paralyze livelihoods in such a way. You're making it sound like every protest is like Ferguson or Baltimore. 

Secondly, the whole point of a protest is to temporarily seize the public's attention and direct it to the problem being protested. There are methods of seizing that attention that are inappropriate, (e.g. vandalizing property, verbally harassing non-participants, physical altercations), but they also tend to be illegal anyway. Barring that, I don't see anything wrong with temporarily rerouting traffic or blocking a sidewalk.

"meh, lets do some math. UPDATED(didn't realize the savings was only 1.5% when you factor in the city sales tax, original numbers were calculated with a 5% savings...way too high)

The 5% is only statewide, dropped from 6.5%, **Seattle adds another 2.7%**, so if it lowered to 5% at the state, you'd only **save 1.5% sales tax**. Add 2.7% to the 5% to get 7.7% sales tax in Seattle.

&gt;150,000 * 0.05 = $7500- my $3800 prop tax = $3700 in new tax

&gt;1.5% savings = 3700 / 0.015 = $246,666, meaning you'd have to consume $246,666 in sales taxable items with a 1.5% savings to break even and start saving money with a $150,000 income.




I'll pass.

"Anyone of ""a certain age"" who was here in the 80s and early 90s has a Pavlovian response to hearing the phrase ""The Monastery.""  It was an infamous all-ages dance location held in, yes, an old wood frame church in SLU.  The church was demolished in I believe 2004, after years of its owner / sponsor of the events battling the city over permits and fines resulting from some of the more nefarious activities that took place at the event.

The owner, who /r/seattle policy suggests I not name even though his name is a matter of public record, was a fellow who had some specific ideas about free love and dance liberating the soul.  Apparently from what I was told by people who went to these, was that attendees had to stand and listen to the owner give rambling, long-winded speeches on various subjects of the human condition prior to the DJ and music being begun.  While the owner might have thought he was providing an important community service, one person who had been to these events told me ""You just had to stand there and listen to (the owner) before anything fun happened.""

So, underage teen sex, Ecstasy and other club drugs, 80s club music, all of it, being promoted by a ""true believer"" who they couldn't close down because of his politics and his force of character.

So instead, they came up with the Teen Dance Ordinance, which gave the city sweeping power to close any all-ages show it wanted, which in turn led to the Vera Project opening, and led to Kris Novaselic entering politics as a spokesman against the Ordinance.  Because as often happens with government regulation, when they outlawed The Monastery they also managed to outlaw normal rock band events, of the kind that were thriving in Seattle at the time.

So there was the spectacle, early 1990s, of Seattle both being an international wellspring of rock band talent, who simultaneously were forbidden to play inside of their own hometown at an all-ages venue unless the owner carried some ridiculous amounts of insurance and met some other fairly impossible to meet criteria.

Fascinating story to watch play itself out.  

I actually met George, oops, the guy we're not allowed to name because of /r/seattle doxxing policy even though his name's a part of public record, at my job at DCLU Microfiche Library in 1994.  He came in and was researching permits and plans as part of his ongoing battles with the City.  Without knowing him from Adam (a fictitious name, we're not doxxing anyone here that I know of), I none the less came away with the impression of a very longwinded, very politically committed, and somewhat screw loose middle-aged guy, who was very certain everyone was out to get him, even a long-haired clerk student such as myself, we all were part of this big conspiracy according to (He who cannot be named because of /r/seattle policy on doxxing even though his name is a matter of public record).

* Seven out of 10 students (72 percent) are meeting reading standards by the end of third grade, effectively the same as in 2008. The gap in achievement between students is evident by this time, with students of color much less likely than their peers to be reading proficiently

"I ride from 15th Ave down to 6th and Olive every day. 


The road conditions on the Hill are terrible. I regularly have to dodge large potholes, cracks, warped pavement. 14th Avenue off E John is particularly terrible, I'm just glad I'm not going fast on that part. 


Riding down E John to Broadway, there are a few sections that I have to dodge while going pretty fast. It's dangerous and sketchy. 


Once I get onto Broadway, it's smooth and I feel more confident. Turning onto Pine is also, for the most part, pretty good. It's a fair to good ride all the way to 6th and Pine, where 6th is a mess of warped and cracked, poorly patched pavement. And that's the end of my ride. All in all, I'd say the streets need some TLC.

"&gt;""The American Dream"" of owning a home is no longer the best investment for you

I've been struggling with this the last few years myself.  We were sold a bill of goods by a generation of plenty who then made sure nobody else could get theirs after.  Which is fine, I guess.  I don't think any of us would do different if we could.  You (meaning everyone) need to step back and ask yourself if owning property is what you actually want or what you were conditioned to want.  I don't mean this in some kind of sinister suburban brainwashing kind of way.  We're all conditioned for certain things society-wide, it's not good or bad (mostly), just how societies work.

So instead of being salty that you can't get what everyone else has, try to be as subjective as you can about what *you* want.  If you decide you want that house in that desirable neighborhood and you can't do it now sounds like you've got some hustling to do.

"I don't fit the requirements for this topic (not from here, didn't grow up here), but I was born and raised on the East Coast and have only really lived in East Coast major cities.

I moved here after Seattle already started experiencing its boom, so I don't have a sense of perspective on how it was before. On the East Coast, the big cities have been 'big cities' for decades if not longer, and continue to grow. 

With that being said, I always wonder, is it reasonable to expect a city to 'stay small'? I hear a lot of the older residents complain about how the city is totally different than what it was, and I can totally get that because it definitely brings complications (like the traffic, sheesh), but Seattle was never *really* a small town. It seems like there's this attitude of older Seattlities wanting to artificially constrain Seattle to this old yesteryear, and it's not adapting very well.

For example, I remember reading how a few decades ago Seattle turned down the opportunity to expand its mass transit because they didn't want a 'big city' feel, but now, decades later, Seattle is a big city anyway and it's paying for its lack of appropriate mass transit with nut to butt traffic.

Question: Liz Holland of Seattle wonders whether she can block her own driveway with her car. Parking is limited on her street, she says -- and you know -- it's her own driveway.

Answer: Nope, says city transportation spokeswoman Kimberly Nunes. Even if you're only blocking yourself in, you can't do it. City law makes no distinction between blocking your driveway and someone else's: ""No person shall stand or park a vehicle in front of a public or private driveway ... or within five feet of the end of a constructed driveway return.""

I'm glad the option was available when I lived there.  The other people in my section of the building seemed to have similar, generally positive opinions.  I think for myself the best combination for affordability/quality is living with roommates, but some people just are not interested in that.

"Good question. I've written this year already about local Republicans worrying about possible ""downballot"" effects of the Trump nomination. They've done polling on that, for sure. 

People I've talked to say they think the divisions could affect the higher-tier races such as U.S. Senate. In that race, as you may have read, Chris Vance, the GOP candidate challenging Patty Murray, has come out and said he can't support Trump. He's taken a lot of heat on that from Trump supporters who say they won't vote for him.

Bill Bryant, the GOP candidate for governor, has refused to say whether he'll vote for Trump or not. It'll be interesting to see which approach turns out to be more effective.

Biggest danger for GOP is that a bunch of moderate suburban voters just sit out the election in disgust.

The Baby Boomers benefitted from the largest government intervention and investment in public goods and services that had ever happened in history. 

What did they do with it? They voted it all away for all future generations. Baby Boomers would receive their pensions, their cheap college tuition, their easy homeownership, all made possibly with government intervention - and they destroyed all of it for all future generations. 

Baby Boomers are the most entitled, ignorant, myopic, self-centered political class in modern history.

*****
&gt; Microsoft plans to lay off 2,850 people during the company&amp;#039;s current fiscal year, new cuts partly related to the company&amp;#039;s troubled smartphone hardware business.

&gt; Microsoft employed 114,000 people at the end of June, about 44,400 in Washington state, the company says.

&gt; The latest cuts follow Microsoft&amp;#039;s announcement in May that the company would lay off 1,850 people, and take a $950 million restructuring charge, as a result of its decision to scrap much of the phone hardware business it bought from Nokia in 2014.

"It sounds like the people who got pissed at you may have over-reacted. However, you acted fucking stupidly as well. Don't come crying to the internet playing the victim and expecting sympathy.

&gt; We drove through West Seattle to catch the ferry and passed the park to get in line.

There are a lot of spots in ferry lines like this where there are signs and stripes painted on the pavement instructing people to keep the intersection clear. My guess is that you mistook one of these gaps for the end of the line.

So, first mistake, and one that is entirely avoidable on your part - have some basic situational awareness of traffic. If there's a long line of cars going one direction, then a gap, look to see if the line continues after the gap. What are the odds that the line starts *exactly* at the intersection you're sitting at?

Now, if someone was going to intentionally cut in the ferry line, these gaps are the exact place they would try to do it. To the other cars around you, your behavior looked a lot like you were intentionally cutting in line, which may explain some of their anger.

&gt; A lady behind us kept honking her horn.

How soon after you got in line did she start honking her horn?

If you get in line for something, and someone behind you in line immediately starts trying to get your attention, what's the most likely reason? Probably that you cut in line, accidentally or on purpose, and they're trying to get your attention to tell you.

Maybe for the first few honks, she was giving you the benefit of the doubt that you're a tourist who didn't know any better. But the longer she honks and the more you seem to ignore it, the more pissed off she's going to get.

&gt; I walked away, noticing a huge gap in front of me in line, I needed to move my car and explain to my family. 

&gt; Now there's a huge gap in front of me, so I pull up and while doing this, I'm explaining to my family that I guess we cut in line.

&gt; We're talking about what to do, and not **three minutes later**

This is where things go from ""rookie mistake plus an over-reaction"" to ""you're a fucking moron"". The lady in the first car got your attention and told you that you cut in line. Yes, she could have been more polite about it.

But the right thing to do here is *move your fucking car to the back of the line*. WTF were you talking about for 3 minutes? You don't need to hold a Family Meeting. Your Aunt Mabel doesn't need to be conference-called in from Kansas to talk strategy and discuss options.

&gt; I post this hoping to put out there something more positive than this residual mixed feeling of rage, embarrassment, fear, and sorrow left now late at night. We can choose how we feel, we don't have to accept the ""default setting."" Be kind and search for understanding, even of those that transgress -- they might be decent people just like you.

You're probably not wrong.  But it's fun to point the finger of justice at those that helped bring it about ... /r/seattle's numerous developer density advocates, graduates of the UW urban planning school, ""urbanist"" bloggers.  People who are useful idiots to the 1%, you deluded idiots who think growth on top of existing middle class is better than growth where none existed previously.

Yet when asked if this will lower rents, the property supply-sider cannot say, because *it is not likely and only economic models in isolation to global trends even suggests its possible.*

People who advocate for hyper growth in Seattle figure enough will trickle down to you that you'll be somehow less damaged than those you help force out.

"Not spooky in itself, but Seattle's had some civil engineering that could be worked into an occult detail. /u/crusisredux mentioned the raising of the street level in Pioneer Square (and the resulting network of underground passages along the old sidewalks and ground-floors), but also the entirety of Denny Hill was [removed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regrading_in_Seattle#/media/File:Denny_Regrade-1.jpg) to try to raise property values. Not everyone living on the hill was completely on-board with the idea.

Puget Sound, especially out in the islands and the north end of the Kitsap Peninsula, was home to a number of utopian or experimental communities in the late-19th-early-20th century. Some of them probably have something creepy about them.

"First, some background. The residential real estate market in the Seattle area today has many similarities to the nationwide real estate bubble that definitively burst in 2008, but it is also different in many ways. I [outlined these similarities and differences in a post last year](http://seattlebubble.com/blog/2015/03/30/welcome-to-housing-bubble-2-0/) that is still equally applicable today.

I would hesitate to call the current market a ""bubble."" Yes, supply is extremely low and prices are surging at an absurd rate. Demand is strong, but not at record-breaking levels. If you [look at the affordability index](http://seattlebubble.com/blog/2016/06/20/low-rates-continue-to-prop-up-affordability/), there is a huge difference between the current market and 2007, mostly thanks to today's insanely low interest rates.

Assuming your question of what ""could cause the housing bubble to pop"" means lower prices and/or less competition among buyers, I think there are a few possibilities.

1. **Tech economy contracts.** - If this were serious enough it would definitely have a major impact on the Seattle area. However, I don't even think Amazon would have to lay people off necessarily. If they just stopped growing and their stock price took a significant tumble I think that would have a big effect on the local housing market.

2. **Interest rates increase.** - Historically, there has not been a very strong direct [relationship between interest rates and home prices](http://seattlebubble.com/blog/2010/02/09/do-rising-interest-rates-lead-to-falling-home-prices/). *However*, interest rates are currently so far below anywhere they have ever been historically that I don't think history is much of a useful guide in this case. I don't know when or if interest rates will go up, but if/when they do, it will definitely decrease demand and probably cause home prices to drop.

3. **Another major national recession.** - While Seattle's real estate market was not hit as hard as the more bubbly areas like Florida, Las Vegas, or Phoenix, home prices here did drop about 33 percent from their peak, which is a pretty big deal when [local real estate agents were saying a 10 percent drop would be ""mammoth proportions.""](http://seattlebubble.com/blog/2010/12/10/friday-flashback-seattles-housing-bubble-all-star-team/) If there were another major national recession we would probably see housing here take another hit.

"1) this was backed by evidence. Per the article, they also looked at wage increases across the state. Admittedly a comparison to areas just outside of Seattle as opposed the whole state would be a better comparison, but the result should be directionally correct.

2) Yes getting paid more for less hours is better. For the scenarios you listed (I.e students looking to pay bills, part time working mothers) this is definitely true. However for anyone entirely trying to subsist on minimum wage, at the end of the day total compensation is really what matters. You have to make ends meet.

What is really being missed here are the people simply not being hired as a result of the higher wage rate. So what is better for those still employed is passed on in a negative fashion to those that don't get a job as a result. This is a little harder to tease out and may be a bit of a moot point given what was discussed in your point #1.

3) I doubt we find common ground here as I don't think businesses have a moral responsibility to provide what you listed. A business exists to provide for its customers and owners. Any employment generated by a business's continued operations is a plus.

&gt;RE: The girls that slept with this guy for the porn audition...

&gt;I'm not trying to judge them or defend the guy in the article when I say this, but they weren't raped. Conned, sure on some level... But they decided to have sex, with a stranger, for the purposes of getting into a business where they would continue to have sex with strangers for money. They made a conscious decision to get involved in an industry rife with drugs, crimes, exploitation, and all sorts of other nasty human behavior. I have some sympathy for them sure, but to equate this to rape only serves to add to the tendency to question/judge the victims of actual sexual assault.

&gt;If a guy tells a girl at a bar that he's a doctor and impresses her to the point that she sleeps with him, only to find out the next morning he drives a taxi, is that rape? If a small porn producer films his own porn and then withholds payment to one of his actors, does that change the otherwise consensual sex into rape?

&gt;If he was legitimately starting an adult film company using amateurs but funding backed out of his first film, would that make any audition/screening sex between consenting adults into rape?

&gt;Devils advocate hypotheticals, I know. But don't think comparisons wouldn't be made at trial.

&gt;The thing that rape lacks, is consent. Auditioning for a porn shoot by fucking a stranger does not imply a lack of consent.

&gt;Again, while I feel some sympathy for those involved, it sounds like a portion of them were simply making an uninformed business decision. That is not rape. Hopefully, they learned their lesson to either be more informed next time they want to do porn, or to find something they're better at.

&gt;EDIT Apparently those who lack reading comprehension make up for it with righteous indignation. The girls I'm referring to were part of a different article and were not blackout drunk acquaintances but girls he allegedly recruited for porn off the internet under false pretenses, as discussed in a previous Stranger article. I don't condone date rape or any of the actions mentioned in this article. Thank you and look! ...a squirrel!

No dude. You chose to comment on an article about rape to discuss how a totally different article about rape was...not about rape. People aren't downvoting you because they don't agree, they are downvoting you because you are minimizing the content of the posted article (and by implication minimizing the rape of these women) by introducing a totally different subject. It's irrelevant to the article, and frankly irresponsible.

"The DNC's charter obliges them to be impartial, and collusion with the Clinton campaign (including planting questions in debates/town halls and creating negative narratives by cooperating with the media) began before anyone even voted.

Yes, Sanders undeniably lost, but the deck was stacked against him, and in a contest abiding by the DNC's rules this shouldn't have happened.

Additionally, the tribalism of the ""not a real Democrat"" argument is silly, especially given that Sanders votes party line with them over 90% of the time and chairs the Congressional Progressive Caucus (created it in fact).",,,,RNGmaster,Roosevelt,,1469739793,t5_2qhad,t3_4v2gki,t1_d5uvbrc,23,1471760193,0,0,d5uznzu,Seattle,23,,flair

"Well put! Unfortunately, wooden boat people might not be able to understand, or find anyone to translate what you are saying.

To provide a gathering place where maritime history comes alive through direct experience and our small craft heritage is enjoyed, preserved, and *passed along to future generations*.
More likely they will contact someone over at Nintendo and have the spawn moved. 

I think I can help! If you need to know something about wooden boats: they eventually rot, are usually driven by big white salesman and were very useful in some sort of triangle trading scheme? Sorry, I'm not really an expert on wooden boats. If you need to find Dragonair! [there is a spawn in this dark alley in Lake City](https://goo.gl/maps/dSCzRR3twAL2)  There are a lot of other good spawns in the area too (Taurus, Rhyhorn, Clefable! all found within a couple blocks) There are lots of local shops nearby, with friendly welcoming owners! Dick's has your burger and shake fix until 2am! Remember to stay safe out there! Stay aware and hunt with friends. Wear reflective clothing at night and make sure that you unplug any power tools when you are done using them!
