"I live in Portland now but am moving to Seattle this weekend. Over the last six, almost seven years I've been here, I've watched the homeless crisis grow. As a lay person, I can't even begin to fathom ideas that would actually help those in need. What I can say is: it's pretty awful to have lost so much public space over the years, and watching more and more places I frequent become covered in used needles and human waste.

There has got to be something better than taking away public-use areas (parks, trails, etc) from taxpayers and their families and giving them to the homeless without any other plan than ""just let them sleep there and I'm sure that'll sort it all out on its own!"".",,,,panornia,,,1476140956,t5_2qhad,t3_56tz46,t1_d8miz7p,67,1478507756,0,0,d8mjxlz,Seattle,,,

ST3 includes significant investments for the City of Seattle, including new light rail to South Lake Union/Denny Triangle, Seattle Center, lower Queen Anne, Interbay, and Ballard; light rail to Delridge and the West Seattle Junction, new light rail stations at 130th Street in the north and Graham Street in the South, and early improvements to make our bus system work better.  And while a million more people will call this region home over the next three decades, they are not going to be only in Seattle - they will live in the entire region. Places like Everett, Tacoma, and Bellevue are going to see explosive growth. Additionally, light rail needs to connect people to job and education centers around the region: Boeing in Everett, Microsoft in Redmond, Costco in Issaquah, UW Tacoma. This system of trains and buses mirrors the growth patterns we expect (and are planning for) in our region.

Finally, [as I described above](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/59bicl/im_dow_constantine_king_county_executive_ama/d97n63u/), I am working to integrate our Metro bus and ST light rail service to ensure that all our Seattle neighborhoods have close, frequent access to transit.",,,,kcexec,King County Executive Dow Constantine,,1477432852,t5_2qhad,t3_59bicl,t1_d97ien0,11,1478877794,0,0,d97nbrw,Seattle,,,flair verified
"I'd like to hear from anyone who can articulate how this is a good idea. From my vantage point this would have drastic consequences on the quality of our parks for potentially years and years to come. One of the first things Giuliani did when he wanted to clean up crime in NYC was doubled down on enforcement and sweeps in city parks.  Essentially making it legal for people to live in city parks indefinitely will:
 - make it harder to monitor and assist our homeless population
 - create unsafe environments for the vast population
 - create biohazard and litter on a scale that will diminish the quality of our parks beyond our recognition of them today

"Is everyone gonna be able to afford their all electric self driving cars? The models I've seen of self driving cars weaving seamlessly through an intersection completely disregard pedestrians / crosswalks.  Even with self driving cars transit can still move more people per direction per hour. You can fit 120~ people in a 60ft bus, more in a 4 car link train. Imagine packing 100s of people in the same space in cars.

&gt; Generously assume that “small form factor” vehicles succeed in doubling vehicle throughput capacity (a big if!). Then assume a standard vehicle occupancy rate of 1.5. Assuming these two factors, the capacity test for autonomous vehicles as congestion reducers and transit replacers is whether or not transit could reliably carry more than 3 people in the same space. That’s a laughably low bar for any urban transit agency. And for a central city like Seattle’s, with 35% of people already taking transit while using 10% of the space? Any major transfer of people from transit to small autonomous vehicles would represent a loss of capacity, not a gain.

"I don't care about the drama going on with moderators here or in other local area subreddits. Seeing this drag on for weeks now is getting ridiculous, and embarrassing for all involved.

What I do care about is having a vibrant and inclusive community here that represents Seattle.  At the end of the day this subreddit is going to be found and visited first by new people to the area and tourists, and all this crap isn't really giving us the greatest impression legitimate or not.

Even before this drama, the subreddit is frequently hostile to the newcomers.  And this is a tone that is set by the moderation team in place.  Signing up on the other one helped me see that.  There are aspects of their setup I think should be here, like the tagging and easy filtering of different types of stories about the area. But all this drama is doing is taking time away from improving this subreddit, and leaving the other one to slowly grow and claim some weird victory even with the less discoverable name. Their pointing out of more specialized local subreddits is also nice to avoid the main one being too cluttered.

How about we get back to building a community here, find a way to get past this, and do a better job as both moderators and as community members of having a healthy online discussion forum.  Please.


**Edit** So at this point, even /u/WSDot is posting stories both here and to SeattleWA. 
And the've been more active over there recently since there's activity there compared to bizarro 0 land over here.  How long till they abandon this subreddit for the other one?  We're one city, not two. This crap needs to come to an end, and quite honestly I feel much of what is in SeattleWA needs to be brought to this sub.

And now you're going to ask me to prove that once we house all the people currently homeless in Seattle, that more won't show up. I guess I can't prove that, but common sense suggests that if we're offering free apartments, people will be more than willing to take us up on the offer. In other words, why would you stay homeless in Portland, if you could just travel 3 hours north and get a free apartment? You wouldn't, unless Portland was offering free apartments too.

To my fellow drivers:  STFU and play some music.  It's not that hard.  The most important thing a driver needs to understand is that at the end of the night they need to be forgettable.   

On the housing issue, our current lack of supply is due to the vacancy rates after the .com bust in 2007.  Our city had high residential and commercial real estate vacancy rates for several years after the crash.  New building stock was not needed, nor economically viable.  The new tech bubble we are experiencing (Amazon, AWS, Cloud, etc) caught everyone (except for Paul Allen) off-guard.  Now we cannot build fast enough to keep up with the demand.  Eventually things will calm down and all of the new market-rate construction will help to make existing housing more accessible to all.

"BRT can only compete viably with light rail if it has entirely off-board payment and runs on 100% dedicated lanes. This second part is very important - otherwise the buses just get stuck in traffic and can't compete at all with driving in speed or reliability, so people would just drive. Light rail has a much higher capacity per ongoing operating cost than BRT, and true BRT isn't even much cheaper to construct than light rail, since acquiring the dedicated right of way is the most expensive part of building out either network.

Not to mention that the political will for true BRT just doesn't exist here in Seattle. It would require taking away lanes from general purpose and/or HOV traffic in order to implement quicker or cheaper than light rail. That would surely inflame the ""war on cars"" folks *way* more than light rail.

Edit: ST3 also includes HOV and shoulder-running BRT along I-405 from Burien to Lynnwood, just in case anyone wasn't aware. And also platform extensions on the south Sounder line to support 10-car trains (the current max is 7).",,,,drew1492,Downtown,,1477789810,t5_2qhad,t3_5a23t3,t1_d9dez0m,28,1478978415,0,0,d9dfbzz,Seattle,,,flair

There were 'little' hills the rest of the course after that, but each one felt like an inch closer to death. I think I would have cried at the Mercer hill which was so close to the finish, but I was too dehydrated and cold to form tears.

Whether intentional or not, the tone of the ad was a dog whistle. Pramila has chosen in her legislative career to practice politics in a different way than brady. She is a grass roots organizer and lion for her ideals. She pushes forward topics in the hope of big comprehensive progressive wins. This usually doesn't result in bills being passed, but it is perfectly legitimate way to practice politics. It shifts frameworks and unhinges institutional road blocks. Brady, whether he likes it or not is part of the boys club, and uses it to his advantage. Pramila doesn't have that luxury or lets say privilage. Discounting her experience based on that is othering her. It infers that because ""she is an outspoken woman of color,"" she won't be able to get ""things"" done.

In 10-15 years we're still going to need *more* transit for our rapidly growing population, so if it's as good as you think it's going to be, we can still work on building both.

I'm all for the free market, but the lines, access, permits, and permission to run them were all built with tax payer money. Comcast has invested in expansion, yes, but done so in an anti-trust fashion.

All of that aside, to answer your question:
  
I live in South Seattle, between MLK and Rainier, in a neighborhood called Columbia City that is inevitably described as ""up and coming.""  
  
What that means is that it is a very diverse area (it was, at least in 2000, [the most diverse ZIP code in America](http://www.seattletimes.com/opinion/seattles-rainier-valley-one-of-americas-dynamic-neighborhoods/) that is currently seeing a tremendous amount of gentrification, following the completion of the Light Rail.

*Fraud*

*A false representation of a matter of fact—whether by words or by conduct, by false or misleading allegations, or by concealment of what should have been disclosed—that deceives and is intended to deceive another so that the individual will act upon it to her or his legal injury.*

"3-4 articles from Seattle Times over the last week or so have painted a pretty clear picture of what Seattle will look like in the next 5 years:

The above article details how we are asking tax payers to vote for parks and roads levies only to those parks and sidewalks over to the homeless. Guess what, most people aren't going for walks through the park or let their kids play if there are drug addicts camping out.  We are paying for parks that non-addicts won't even be able to use anymore.

[We are also going to pay for safe injection sites for the same drug users](http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/crime/open-public-sites-in-seattle-king-county-for-heroin-use-task-force-says/), again in the hope that somehow by making addiction safer, easier and less costly people will be incentivized to get clean.

Finally, we seem totally unsure of how to deal with [the epidemic of property crime](http://www.seattletimes.com/pacific-nw-magazine/personal-property-theft-is-a-serious-problem-in-seattle-and-were-not-sure-how-to-stop-it/) by the said drug users to fuel their habit.  Combined with the opposition to additional police officers in the north end where most of the property crime occurs.

Seems like the goal is to get home owners and renters to pay drug users to live in parks and have a place to shoot up so they can continue to rob our homes to fuel their addiction.  Sure glad the council is kicking the neighborhood out and [letting lobbyists write our laws](http://sccinsight.com/2016/09/28/move-in-fees-legislation-youre-doing-it-wrong/).

There are unused shelter beds every night that we already fund.  The people who are camping out just don't want to abide by the rules of those shelters (mostly no drugs or drinking).  So now we are capitulating and allow them addicts to dictate to the taxpayers the terms of the assistance. How does that make sense?  When I ask for a favor from someone, they get to dictate the terms, not me. 

I am all for helping people who want help.  If you lost your job, got injured, made a mistake, lets get you back on your feet.  If you just want to keep using and that is more important than a roof over your head... sorry, I don't want to support your addiction.",,,,wise_marsupial,,,1476041673,t5_2qhad,t3_56fjvy,t1_d8j5937,14,1478477407,0,0,d8kt5nu,Seattle,,,

"Thanks for this question. Sound Transit worked hard to shave several years off the timelines for the final plan that is going before voters.  And yes, there are a number of ways that Sound Transit could speed up these timelines even more. Federal funding is already a part of the assumptions for the financing plan, but if Sound Transit is able to secure additional federal grants, it is possible to deliver these projects even earlier. For example, Sound Transit was able to deliver the newly opened Angle Lake station four years earlier than planned because of a federal TIGER grant. 


There are other ways Sound Transit can work to accelerate the projects. For example, local governments can also work in the coming years to streamline their permitting which could cut years off certain projects. The cities of Seattle and Everett, and Snohomish County, have already signaled that they will work to make light rail an outright permitted use, shortening the time to approval.

"A little advice for the Lyft and Uber and other ride-share drivers: unless and until you know the predilections of your passengers, don't espouse your political beliefs or regional socioeconomic platform.

Do you really want to make your passengers uncomfortable like this?

My wife once felt the need to adopt a fake identity after her driver made some disparaging comment about Amazon employees before even bothering to ask where she works (you can guess the answer).

Such behavior is neither customer-friendly nor is it new acquaintance-friendly, so whether you see ride-sharing as just a job or as a way to meet new people, it's inappropriate.

I haven't run into this personally myself, but if/when I do, I'm just gonna give such drivers bad ratings. Nobody is ride sharing with you in order to feel awkward or ashamed.",,,,matunos,,,1477251562,t5_2qhad,t3_58zpno,t3_58zpno,35,1478824719,0,0,d94lspo,Seattle,,,

"Autonomous vehicles don't solve the main problem of transportation in city environments, which is an issue of geometry. If you imagine 200 people in cars on a freeway, and how much space that takes, then imagine those 200 people walking, biking, or in a light rail car.  It takes much less space: http://urbanist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83454714d69e2017d3c37d8ac970c-800wi

Autonomous cars don't solve the space in cities problem, in fact they might make it much worse (""hey, instead of paying for parking after I commute in my autonomous vehicle to my office, I can just send my car home, then have it return later to come pick me up"").  Autonomous vehicles might lead to an expansion of car-based trips, not a decline.

Light Rail/Subways on the other hand, are very efficient at moving lots of people.  Link Light Rail is being built to 15 trains per hour in 4-train combinations. That can carry 16,000 people per hour per direction per light rail line.

"Very sorry that that happened to you.  I hope the repairs and dealing with the cc company at least goes smoothly for you.

For the sake of anyone else reading, gym parking lots are ridiculously easy targets for thieves. A huge amount of people show up directly after finishing work, so they likely have at least wallets/purses with them.  Spotting what people fuss around in their vehicle ""hiding"" items before going inside is easy and/or just watching who doesn't go inside with a purse and is still in work attire.  

Arriving at the gym in workout clothes and everything either removed or already stashed, even if it means stopping by home first or changing at work, makes you (your vehicle more precisely) look less desirable compared to the person that is guaranteed to show up within minutes of you and will spend minutes shuffling around or worse being seen putting items in a trunk.  The lockers in gyms aren't much in the way of physical deterrents but at least there is usually enough people going in and out that anyone doing something they shouldn't might get some attention rather quickly whereas parking lots might as well be the Wild West for how little staff anywhere can prevent the parking lot problems.

"I was curious because I was going to be a chef in a past life. I have done private vegetarian catering off and on. What stopped me from going to culinary school, which is the path I thought necessary at the time, was talking to the head chef at the high end banquet hotel I worked at along with three of his sous chefs. 

They all said the same thing. The hours are terrible and long with low pay until you get into a head chef position. The recognition is eventually nice but the hours away from family, missed soccer games, school plays etc. wore on everyone. Ad that to the fact that people are finicky as hell and use incredibly arbitrary matrices (like the ones you described above), it's a shit show. Mind you this was in the mid 1990s. 

The thing that was the final nail in the coffin was when the head chef had a client come into his office in the kitchen to discuss her menu with the banquet manager. She wanted tons of special items at the same price as our regularly offered fare. She also wanted them prepared in specific ways, ala from magazines she'd read. This was all fine but she had a really difficult time with the fact that all this would increase labor time because the preparations were pretty involved. This would cost more. She didn't like that. Then she said this.

""How hard can it be? It's only food."" 

I was standing outside the office at my prep table listening. The chef immediately stood up and calmly walked out of his office, leaving the woman and the banquet manager in there alone. I made eye contact with him and the look he gave me was the weight of years of dealing with people who didn't, and didn't want to understand the value of what he did and the passion he had for his craft. He was a nice man, diligent and dedicated. The woman went with our normal menu because she didn't want to pay extra for anything. 

That kind of killed the joy for me.

"Do you know how much the city of Seattle spends on homelessness a year?  $50 fucking million dollars.  Is that not real money?  Mayor Murray promised to increase taxes so he can spend even more next year on ineffectual at best, and damaging at worst, programs for the homeless.

This money goes to what?  Who knows there's no transparency.  And the problem is only getting worse so whatever that money is going to is not working.
I think what u/Gorshiea is saying is we should spend money on things that might actually help instead of letting heroin junkies and criminally insane people camp wherever they want.

Have you had to shield your 2 year old daughter's eyes from a man masturbating on the sidewalk in the middle of the day?  Have your wife and child been attacked by a criminally insane junky while walking in a very public place?
No? Then fuck you and your high horse and nice theories about the rich should pay for these nice little homeless people who just need a few bucks and they'll get right back on their feed.  Fuck you and everyone like you who enable these degenerate junkies while ignoring the fact that every dollar we that we waste on them is a dollar not spent on that single mom who's on the street because she's escaping an abusive relationship.

"&gt; I couldn't believe the tent camps and how much junk was laying around them. I've been to LA and I honestly didn't even think the issue was that bad there. Anyways, I am just trying to gain some inside knowledge as to why this is still such an ongoing problem.

LA has no problems moving the homeless out of touristy areas - literally picking up their stuff, throwing it away, and bussing them to less desirable areas of the city.

Seattle hasn't shown any desire to do that, attributable mostly to civil rights / human rights concerns of the electorate.

Whether you find LA's approach or Seattle's approach favorable likely depends on your social beliefs - personally, I feel the ""right"" answer is somewhere between the two, though defining exactly that point is difficult. 

Rest assured, though, that LA hasn't fixed this problem either - [LA's homeless are around, you just have to know where to look](https://goo.gl/maps/yj8CDiBkGED2) .

"I met Matt about two months ago on a trip to Vegas. I had posted to r/forhire looking for someone to build a simple app for me, and he responded. Realizing we were both in Vegas, we decided to meet over beers. He was late for that meeting (as he was for every appointment we ever made) as he did not have a car.

My initial impressions were that he was a nice guy but perhaps not employee material. Still, the project was simple enough that I decided to let him have a crack at it. 

(Curiously, the first thing he mentioned to me was that he had met a girl on the way over. I thought it was a little strange as he didn't look like he cared very much about his appearance.)

We met in person a second time a couple of weeks later. He was fumbling with the app and it was obvious he's not a programmer. But I decided to bring another developer on board, and let Matt manage the project.

I left for Europe. Matt was knowledgeable enough about tech that I also decided to let him manage a larger project I was working on. I set up a telecon, and re-arranged my travels to make time for it. I gave Matt numerous heads-ups about the meeting, and he promised he would attend. But he never made it. Later he came on Skype and said he had left his backpack with his phone and macbook in a cab, and that he was an idiot. (He lost out on $500 by not making this meeting.)

After this, communication with Matt became harder and harder. He told me he was traveling, and of course I now know why. Needless to say, I knew nothing about the charges. Matt had boasted about being the journalist who broke the story about Amazon Drones, but I (very) stupidly neglected to ever google his name.

Finally, earlier this week, I decided that it wasn't going to work. I placed a hold on any remaining payments. There was no communication at all. Then, amazingly, yesterday morning I finally googled him. The headline 'Matt Hickey Charged with Rape' appeared. I figured it must be a different guy. Then I clicked Images. Holy shit. It was sheer coincidence that I decided to google him on the same day it all went down. 

I do know Matt's current Reddit username. I won't disclose that here; I sent it to Sydney at The Stranger and will let him decide whether he wants to disclose it. But I can tell you Matt was posting yesterday right up until his arrest. 

I would not have suspected Matt was like this. It's shocking. He was actually a very friendly guy toward me. We shared an interest in science. We tinkered with a Geiger counter at the Atomic Bar in Vegas. He told me all about Volcanoes when he learned I was going to Italy. I was frequently in contact with him and kept him posted on my trip. 

Matt never made any attempt to conceal his real name. In fact as I was adding him as a contact in a project management system, he insisted on using his full name 'Michael-Jon'.

"Aeronautical engineer and pilot here.

I often hear people ask about how airplanes work: *How do wings generate lift? Why are wider engines more fuel-efficient? Could a jetliner fly upside-down? Why do small airplanes use propellers while big airplanes use jet engines? Why are stealth airplanes flat with straight sharp edges? Why can't a propeller airplane break the sound barrier? What are all those moving surfaces that stick out of an airliner's wing? Why don't more airplanes use low-drag features like canards, thin glider-like wings, or tail-less configurations like flying wings? What about electric motors? Solar power? Why are small airplanes still built with draggy features like wing struts and rectangular wings?*

I see these questions on reddit, I hear them during commercial flights and social gatherings when people learn what I do for a living, I overhear them at airshows and air museums... often followed by erroneous answers by people who sound very confident. ([I try to answer them as often as I can](https://www.reddit.com/comments/55gzxg/im_teaching_a_oneday_course_about_airplane_design/d8ahg1a), but as you know, informative comments unfortunately do not rise to the top if they come too late).

Now, the thing is, it is possible to answer these questions without pulling out equations. With a clear diagram, video, or sometimes just a photo along with a clear explanation, even someone who did not take Newtonian physics can totally understand how each part of an airplane works, why airplanes are designed the way they are, what is or is not possible, etc.

So **I created an 8-hour course where I basically cover all the concepts in aeronautical engineering**: the different kinds of drag and how various drag-reduction features work, how wings generate lift, how airplane engines work, how airplane structures are designed and built, how airplanes are controlled, why tail fins are generally a good idea, how things are sized in order to make for safe takeoffs and landings even if there's an engine failure, etc.

**I put many many many hours into creating 500 slides full of diagrams, videos, and photos, and crafting simple explanations** that a high-schooler could understand.

I taught this course at Stanford once, at UW three times, inside Boeing six times so far (for people who do not have an aeronautics or even engineering background: machinists, HR, IT, materials scientists, etc... and I will teach it within Boeing three more times very soon, and they have already asked me when I can do it again later). Now I am about to offer my course to the general public.

I apologize for the self-promotion, but I am honestly proud of this course and its success. Each time I taught this course, I filled a 50-person room. I get very positive feedback. And those 500 slides, I need to turn them into a book: I feel like such a book (especially if I keep updating it) will be valuable to people even after I'm gone.

"The total cost of the 62 miles of light rail based on year of expenditure (YOE) dollars is $31.7b (building of the rail and stations and park&amp;ride and station access etc). The average cost is $511m/mile. The cost of operation and maintenance of the facilities till 2041 is $3b. These amounts don't include the light rail vehicles (purchase+operation+maintenance till 2041 $2.5b), bases (construction+operation+maintenance till 2041 $2.3b). All these light rail related items cost roughly $40b.
The rest of the $14b mostly goes to:

- BRT: $3b
- Sounder Commuter rail: $2.5b
- Debt service (interest payment etc): $7b

To compare apple to apple to the average you quoted, we should use the non-inflated cost (i.e. the YOE $31.7b without inflation adjustment). On 2014 dollars, the cost (design, permits, property acquisition, construction of rails and stations) of each line are:

- Ballard line: $473m/mile
- West Seattle line: $328m/mile
- Everett line: $187m/mile
- Issaquah line: $162m/mile
- Redmond line: $277m/mile
- Kent line: $196m/mile
- Tacoma line: $210m/mile
- Tacoma extension line: $110m/mile

"Now, that would require money, and raising taxes to help the poors is just silly. Why would we want to have a tax on people who earn more than others, to spend on people who just want to be homeless? Cause that's how those people are, right? Everyone who is homeless wants to be.

That would offend the people who give money to furthering city council campaigns, since giving money to politicians *totally* isnt bribery if the one getting the money magically declares it *not bribery*, and totally prohibiting people who are awesome at life from being able to have more free speech than anyone else.

"Near-lifelong resident here: depending on where you live, we can be pretty bad about turning on power expediently.

"That's a great question. Most light rail lines take 12 to 15 years to build depending on the scope and complexity of the project.  In April, nearly 40,000 people gave feedback on the draft plan and the resounding response: let’s speed this up! Sound Transit responding by shaving several years off of almost every project.  When Sound Transit Proposition 1 passes I will be pushing Sound Transit and local jurisdictions to do everything they can to speed up the timelines even more - from streamlining local permitting to securing grants.

Many homeless people have jobs, they just can't afford the rent in the area or get past the other rental requirements.

There are also an estimated 100,000 homeless college students in the USA. They aren't sitting on their asses.

You think that about the homeless because the only ones you can see and recognize are the ""bag people"" living in cardboard boxes along the streets.

"Yep, increased housing costs, because of the massive economic growth they bring in. It wouldnt be a problem, except there's a lot of people in Seattle, especially in the Central Seattle areas (Capitol Hill, Stevens, Miller Park, Montlake, Central District, Madrona, etc.) who refuse housing height limit increases. Their selfish and short-term attitudes cause a massive limitation in the capacity for people to move to Seattle.

Even if a developer wants to come in and buy their house for 2-3x it's value (netting them well over 3-4 million), and build a massive mid/high rise apartment building, they cannot because of building codes.

The people in those areas will eventually have their housing seized by the city, under eminent domain, in 10-15 years, if they do not relent, simply because Seattle needs the housing space, once prices hit 2x San Francisco levels. Seattle does not have the capacity for suburbs north of I-90 and south of 520 anymore, and it's only the ignorance and selfishness of the people who protest those changes that cause this issue.

It's up to them to make the decision, if they'll sell their land in 3-5 years to developers, or have it siezed by the city in 10-15.

Two things.  This track is the perfect track of strong winds over Puget Sound.  Second, the worst windstorms are rapidly intensifying as the make landfall...like this storm.

The wind forecast map (for sustained winds) at 11 PM Saturday suggest sustained winds of 25-30 mph, with gusts of 35-45 mph--but I would not be surprised if they end up higher.  But we can update that later.

Bottom line:  the Saturday storm is the big windstorm threat and has the potential to be one of the strongest windstorms we have seen in a few years.   There is still uncertainty in the forecast.  

Keep in mind what we are trying to do...forecast the exact track and intensity of a storm that is now thousands of miles away and currently very weak.

That's horseshit for any number of obvious reasons, not included to price of rent/price of lease/renovation costs/zoning hell/etc.  Maybe, just maybe, they picked the one place in Seattle that made sense for their budget and opened up because if they didn't they were going out of business.  

Regardless of the family drama, IFP makes absurdly good pizza.  I'm partial to the clam/garlic/white, but they don't make anything that isn't amazing.  Maybe, and just maybe, we can realize that ""the homeless problem"" isn't a monolith.  There's a lot of people involved, and city council is responsible for not moving on the issues of a) zero validation for tiny home living, b) prosecution of violent crimes, and c) oddly enough, hiring more police officers.

Seattle has a long way to go before we have a justice system that functions normally.  During this massive economic boom we've watched as the City refuses to go to task with SPOG and check the absurd protections officers in this city are provided.  In an ironic twist, we also find ourselves in a position where we desparately need many more active duty patrol officers.  We've got two problems that attack the same coin from different sides.  That we don't have a Mayor or City Council which elect to resolve these concerns is beyond me.",,,,ruddyirishhamface,,,1476333311,t5_2qhad,t3_577dhy,t3_577dhy,13,1478565484,0,0,d8pv13b,Seattle,,,

"You aren't going to get a better run system than Sound Transit especially compared to its peers. The trains are clean, well run, stations have lots of security, they have no worthless station agents sitting in a booth. Over the last 15 years they have come a long way. Sure, in the 90s they had wildly optimistic projections that almost sank the organization but since then they have greatly improved and are almost overly conservative and cautious and now come in ahead of schedule and under budget.

Personally I think the whole manufactured outrage by the Seattle Times over the opening celebration was the biggest non-story by an irrelevant agenda-driven dwindling newspaper on its last gasps of air. The opening of University Link was a big deal, these two stations are heavily used stations and will be the among the very busiest in the entire built out system and afterall serve a huge public university and the densest residential neighborhood in the state. I attended the opening, it was not extravagant by any means but was something that absolutely should be celebrated by the community that funded the system and will use and benefit from it for the next 250+ years. Most of the money for the opening was spent on crowd control because people were so excited to use the new stations and its shockingly fast travel times.",,,,ponchoed,,,1477181343,t5_2qhad,t3_58vbb0,t1_d93lpoa,13,1478807862,0,0,d93mzwx,Seattle,,,

Not really, because DWS had already served her purpose by the time she resigned. Hillary had no reason to leave DWS as DNC chair since she had already secured the nomination and will become leader of the party if she is elected president.

"Sorry, no. 

Unfortunately, police resources are limited and as angry as this car prowl makes you, and most law abiding Seattleites, our city simply doesn't have the people/time/money to exhaust all leads for every property crime. 

My best advice to you is to call the North Precinct and leave a message for the responding officer asking them to call you. You can then tell them about the stores that have footage, the timing and proximity to the theft location. 

Don't get your hopes up though. Even if the perpetrator is caught and charged, chances are minimal they'd serve jail time or you'd receive restitution. 

I'd advise your CC company of the existing video. They may have stronger charges to bring against the responsible party than local law enforcement. I have no idea if footage would be shared between the CC company and SPD, though I doubt it would be.

"Without kids, and the daycare/school drop off and pickup schedule, one car is definitely doable here. There is a lot of public transportation from all over the region that takes you to downtown and south lake union. So until you're at a point in your life where you have a mini person that MUST be picked up by 6pm, it's very doable from all over the place without a car. 

Seattle also has some prolific car sharing programs in Cars2Go and ReachNow for those days when both of you really have to drive. Even with two kids, my husband and I typically carpool, but occasionally throw light rail, buses or car shares in the mix if we need to split up in the morning or evening. 

Finally, I'd encourage you to take advantage of the temporary housing Amazon is going to offer. That'll let you get to know the region before deciding which lifestyle is right for you. It can range from urban living (Belltown, Etc) down to rural island life (Vashon), and everything in between,  all within commutable distance from Amazon.

"There's an article out there that talks about this very phenomenon. They described Seattle's approach as ""building a difficult thing the difficult way"". It was a contrast to early subway systems like New York - fully grade separated, highly robust systems that have stood the test of time precisely because they were engineered to be as useful as possible - which were difficult things built the easy way - with basically no regard for the human lives that were taken in building them, and no concern for the people who would be displaced by the construction. The other contrast was places like Portland that have built basically easy things - rail systems using preexisting rights of way and leaving the vast majority of the system at grade, interacting with (and being impeded by) regular city traffic through much of its useful coverage - but done in the difficult way of fundamentally respecting the lives of workers and communities that would be sacrificed for the betterment of everyone. Cities like Portland and Minneapolis can get away with building cheaper because they just plain aren't as useful or robust. Portland's MAX has a ton of lines merging together to cross the Steel Bridge, limiting throughput on most of its lines to less than half of their individual capacity, while simultaneously restricted in the size of trainsets that can be used due to the requirement of platforms being limited to the length of a city block. Both of those insane limitations are being avoided in the buildout of the Link light rail system - ST3 contains a second downtown tunnel to limit multi-lining, and the at-grade interaction is significantly limited, with no ROW sharing with other modes of transportation, and basically no additional at-grade crossings from what I've seen of the eastlink and ST3 plans. Seattle is getting an incredibly better system than Portland will ever be able to dream of, precisely because Link light rail isn't being built cutting corners. Building it the right way will pay dividends for decades.",,,,vanisaac,,,1477813991,t5_2qhad,t3_5a23t3,t1_d9djwk4,21,1478984022,0,0,d9dqvm9,Seattle,,,

"I have been homeless in the Seattle area for two years now. I am lucky in the fact that I can at least afford a motel room for my family. Just trying to move out of here and into an apartment is too expensive when you take into account unregulated application fees and deposits. There are really no resources to help with those and all housing lists are either closed or have a 3-5 year waiting list. I wish I could work to get extra income to be able to move, but as a single disabled mother it is very difficult to find one that fits my needs. The system is broken. Sure, I can get food banks and clothing banks...but not a home for my family and I. I have met a lot of the people that end up in those homeless camps because of rising rents, job loss, and other unfortunate circumstances. We have had three other families with little kids leave this motel because they ran out of savings and are now living in their cars. The churches are all maxed out and the cold is setting in. Those are who I pray about at night. Homelessness is not always crazies or drug addicts.

* You can't always get back in unless you line up early, which means you can't get a job that won't let you off early.

* Bedbugs (if you've ever had them, you would run far away from them too)

* Lice

* Assault

* Can't bring a weapon in to defend yourself from said assault

"Homelessness has more to do with lifestyle than it does with the rent in an area. You can walk a few hours in practically any direction and find reasonable rents and opportunity to work or study. Most people are given second, third, fourth chances if they are willing to really commit to whatever is available. For much of the new homeless, it just wasn't worth it and they had a lifetime of self destructive behavior behind them, and they feel trapped after that. It may be harder to rent a place, but you can't argue that having a place to stay would solve their problems. To that point, many people return to family or live with friends. A limited supply of housing isn't a new problem or a very interesting one - people adjust when they need to.

If those individuals weren't homeless you'd just label them differently and still have the same political agendas to debate which ultimately have no interest in helping them directly. No, I don't think freedom to live in a tent somewhere close to a skyscaper or in a park by affluent people will do much for their habits, you have to remember that these aren't the highly educated risk takers you've grown up with who are one bright idea away from huge success and just need to be left alone.

"I worked at a shelter for three years, and this reply is utter bullshit. To get help, you need a lot of things. You need paperwork saying who you are (ID, a mailing address etc), you need an advocate, you need a firm idea on where to go. Most of the shelters here have to focus on one thing like being a youth shelter, a man's shelter, a woman's shelter etc in order to get funding, so if you're a family, you have to split up. If you have a service animal as many with severe issues do, your shelter won't take it. If you have a substance abuse problem you have trouble controlling, most shelters won't let you stay, but they also do not have treatment options available to you.

The things I mentioned are all problems you have to deal with before you even start to consider how many open beds the city has available for homeless people. Spoiler alert- Seattle has 2 homeless people for every 1 bed open, and that's in a good year. Sometimes only 1/3 of the people who needs beds can get one.

Then, the shelters can't let you stay forever. So if you come in and start to get up on your feet, your stay might be over before you find more permanent housing and you're back on the streets.

So. I can see why semi-permanent camping seems better than going around and around on the shelter roller-coaster. And of course there is some truth in what you say too- some people don't want to be told what to do or how to behave and avoid shelters- but the challenges to escaping homelessness are much more difficult than you may believe.",,,,mudda,,,1476229192,t5_2qhad,t3_56zs2g,t1_d8o09vy,60,1478534017,0,0,d8o28if,Seattle,,,

"1. If you actually had any grasp of reading comprehension, you would know that I work for one of these places. I can't donate those 40 hours a week, much as I would like to. It won't do a whole lot of good if I am also homeless. But I do put in effort beyond what I am paid. All of us do. 

2. I've volunteered for a mental health organization for 3.5 years, which is time donated. At least 500 hours. I have purchased hundreds of dollars in supplies over the years for this organization because it's something I care about. 

3. I donate cash to these places when I get the chance. It's tax deductible, and I do what I can with my fresh-out-of-college salary. It's not much. I'm barely above the cutoff for food stamps myself.

"Could there even be one axis of ""goodness"" along which all restaurants fall? Let's break that down: What if the food's good but the service is terrible?

Let's suppose that all of those things I mentioned in the first paragraph (and there are a ton more) are at least possible to be objectively determined and stack-ranked. ALL OF THAT still doesn't account for taste. Don't like sushi? Vegan? Gluten intolerant (growls)? Hate fads? Love food as fashion? What if it's a poorly-regarded genre (high-quality Mexican comes to mind)?

This is almost certainly nothing to do with letting them outside (other than the fact that the cat can just go any time it feels the need and can't hold it), but could be a sign of numerous medical problems with the cat. If it is behavioral you CAN train it out of them with some time and effort.

I had an outdoor cat previously in the city, my ex-roommate forced us to make him an indoor/outdoor cat and while he seemed happier being outdoors he got into a lot of fights with the asshole local ginger tom, got bitten enough to need a vet visit and eventually was hit by a car and died.

Many people have already posted about the significant culture differences (which imo plays favorably to Microsoft) so I won't rehash that. 

My main piece of advice is to really consider whether you want to be looking for a new job 2-3 years after graduating, because you likely won't want to stay at Amazon. Or, do you want to be in a well paying, stable job/trajectory that gives you the freedom to focus on other life priorities (buying a house, having kids, etc...).

"That was dumbest, laziest attempt at Bellevue bashing I've seen.  Almost every cliche listed there could be applied to Seattle proper or were just blatantly misguided.  

IN ORDER:

New buildings - More cranes in Seattle right now than in any major city.  Cities grow, this is not unique to Bellevue or Seattle

Lower income population - Segregated in three areas of Crossroads, Lake Hills &amp; Factoria. Sound familiar? It should.

New restaurants - The picture of Ding Tai Fung is fucking rich. The one in U Village is newer than the one in Bellevue with a second one set to open in Pacific Place.  Aside from that, Seattle has a new restaurant opening every five seconds in SLU or Capitol Hill.

Tech Industry D Bags - First of all, mocking someone because of their job is pretty low but whatever.  What's more ignorant was their example of Expedia, a company that is moving to Interbay in the next year or so.  

Past that, what is there? Microsoft? Compare that to god knows how many tech companies cropping up in Seattle proper (not that there's anything wrong with that).

Complaining about buses not having WiFi- THAT'S d-bag entitlement.

Racist joke about too many Indians - very lovely.

Tesla as a status symbol - As if there aren't 5 other major car manufactures at the same price point or that electric cars aren't popular in Seattle.

The sexism - Just as nice as the aforementioned racism.

    The storm is rapidly intensifying right now, which produces uncertainty on exactly the strength at landfall.""

What does that even mean? Is it ok to hate them outside of the zone? Who are they being protected from?  Even just that phrasing implies they need protection from other races.

Taken to an extreme, it becomes a force for thought and speech censorship and does nothing to actually build a sense of togetherness and understanding across people.

But the Seattle government A) doesn't give a shit where you put up a tent and B) doesn't try to help anyone who might be living on the street other than giving them food so they can continue to live on the street.

"Minimum wage is going to be gradually raised to $15/hr. However, parking, housing and transport are insane. I work at a tech firm. Most of us make in the six figures and we rent or live in homes that most people from Texas would consider ghetto. (And yet... They are in really nice neighborhoods just, housing is about 2x the national average.)

Tipping is not super high here--people know you get paid minimum wage on top of it--but good prices are high so your percentage is not bad.

Ultimately I would never recommend moving to Seattle for the minimum wage. It is chasing cost of living which is driven by the tech scene. 

You might be able to get by here by sharing space but you will be driving hours to work.

So... I wish you good luck. It is a rough town to be poor in these days.",,,,Schloopish,,,1477286855,t5_2qhad,t3_592wt8,t3_592wt8,10,1478835969,0,0,d95906p,Seattle,,,

"&gt; Honolulu 

Isn't exactly a ""housing market"" in the sense they're using here. The entire state of Hawaii has roughly only 1/3rd the population of the Seattle Metro region. (1.42 mil vs 3.73 mil). Honolulu itself is under 375k.

Average house price in Hawaii is $571,500 vs Seattle's $594,600.

While the average house price in Honolulu is higher at $640,500, if we're limiting it to single cities though then we reach new problems, for instance one of Seattle's suburbs Medina the average house is $2,433,700.

"Two years of living here has given me a huge perspective on the issue of homelessness. So many different people end up here for so many reasons that it is impossible to name, but getting out always falls back on the same issues that are constantly overlooked when we discuss homelessness. 

1. Evictions - If you have any evictions on your record that can instantly get you denied on an application. One family here has been here longer than I have and even through they have the money to move, no one will take them because of an eviction that happened 5 years ago. They have never missed paying rent here in the last two years but that doesn't seem to matter to perspective landlords. 

2. Application fees - most places charge a non-refundable application fee of 30-50 dollars for background and credit checks. There is no help with funds to cover these fees and no guarantee that you will get the place if you pay the fee. So if you have bad credit or even a minor bad criminal history, you are instantly denied and lost money for the privledge of them telling you to f*ck off.

3. Bad credit - I am from Utah and was uninsured for much of my twenties. Most of my credit report is medical debt. But in Utah, they sold it to various debt buying companies that don't report it as medical but mostly looks like unpaid accounts. 

4. First and last or first and deposit -This is a hard one to come up with all at once when you are homeless. Most of your money goes out the door on just food and shelter. It is hard to save money when you don't have a lot to begin with. And if you have been homeless for awhile, this becomes harder and harder. As soon as I get money it is out the door on bills, food, and last minute expenses.

5. Pet deposits - Usually a 300-600 per pet. My mom has ptsd and her cats help her cope. If I get rid of the cats she will loose her mind, but to keep them I am looking at even more money on top of the deposit. Most long term people here have pets and can't afford the extra deposits.

6. Most churches can get you a few nights at motels, but run out of funds so quickly that they can't help much more than that. The three families I mentioned all had to leave because the church ran out of funds and couldn't help them pay rent while they were looking for jobs. 

7. Transportation costs - my cars brakes went bad and I can't afford to fix it. Bus fare adds up a lot. There is no real relief there when you have a family who has a lot of appointments and school and shopping trips. Even taking my kids to the doctors costs me not only bus fare, but packing picnics and such because some appointments are far away. I recently had to take my daughter to a series of appointments at Seattle children's which are all day excursions on the bus. 

8. Housing lists - 3-5 year waiting lists. Section 8 is closed. And even if you had a voucher there are not a lot of places that accept them anymore.

9. Raising rent costs - they are out of control. And most places are requiring at least 3x the monthly rent in income and I don't qualify don't get that much. 

10. Most low income places are either just for seniors or are maxed out with people. 

These are the things that are not really getting solved or even looked at. 

If anyone wants to help, the best thing to do is donate to local churches that do help. St. Vincent De Paul or any church with a food bank or community kitchen. Shelters are good too although most people don't want to go because they are overrun with bed bugs, scabies, or theft. 

This is all just in my opinion of course.",,,,coffeetish,,,1476165893,t5_2qhad,t3_56tz46,t1_d8my8gf,10,1478515616,0,0,d8n0703,Seattle,,,

"I'm a subcontractor involved with commercial construction projects like the Seattle Housing Authority and recovery type organizations where low income housing is being built. Hopefully enough is being built along with our construction boom to allow for people to utilize it. The problem is drugs like heroin and mental health issues dominate the homeless, both situations being relatively hopeless short of forcing people into institutions. These people are either content to stick needles in their arm in the nooks and crannies of our city or simply do not know any better due to addiction/mental health. Having a city that's so inviting towards homelessness is the antithesis of tough love and perpetuates an environment for people to continue on their self destructive life paths without recourse. Cops in this city will not do anything most of the time even if you tell them they are actively injecting H in their arm on the sidewalk. It's sad but I think a path to salvation is by jailing them, then getting them therapy/help, then guiding them towards low income housing. A part of the problem is lack of manufacturing style jobs in this country. If we had extremely low wage labor and paired that sort of job with low income housing, i think we would allow people to succeed more often. There's always going to be a fraction of society that is homeless but to draw them all to a single city that has rampant heroin use is just allowing these poor people to further dismantle their lives.

"Sound Transit Proposition 1 has strong support, and we are working 24/7 to win on November 8th. The reality is that it has taken decades to get to this community-wide consensus. There is no alternative plan, because there is no alternative to a complete, regional system. This plan was developed over 3.5 years with the input of hundreds of stakeholders and nearly 40,000 public comments. This is the region’s plan. Opponents to this measure offer no alternative, and in fact most of them are transparently anti-transit. It is unlikely that Sound Transit would place a new proposal before voters within the next few years. When the voters turned down the Forward Thrust transit expansion plan in 1968 and 1970, we didn’t pass a high capacity transit expansion until 1996. Because of increasing costs over time, it is unlikely that any future proposal would reach all the places that Proposition 1 will. And whatever it does include will be delivered that much later.

Our region has been waiting for decades to make this critical investment and now is the time.  Puget Sound is expected to grow by over a million people in the next several decades. **Our economy and environment cannot afford to wait any longer to build our mass transit system.**  The right time is right now, and I encourage you to vote YES on Proposition 1 and help get out the vote.

"I finished my MBA in 2013. Worked at Amazon for 2.5 years, recently started working at Microsoft.

Financially speaking, I would say the problem with working at Amazon is they work you hard, stock is accelerated vesting (so you don't get much of it until your two year mark). That said, when I was working there I was given stock when it was still under 400 dollars a share. I made out like a bandit with my final vest before starting at Microsoft.

I will say that Amazon's signing bonus was more generous than Microsoft, but Microsoft's base salary is higher than Amazon and more generous with up to a 20% performance bonus each year. 

Microsoft's benefits are probably among the best in the region (can't speak to FB and Google). Amazon is functionally adequate.

Given those considerations, if you were to get hired today, I would argue that Microsoft's total compensation is going to be higher than what you'd get for the same role at Amazon.

Culture wise, Amazon really depends on the team. I've heard retail teams are crap, but AWS, Amazon Publishing, Amazon Studios, Amazon Instant Video, Prime Air, etc. have a more startup like culture. There was a NYTimes article about people being bullied so much they were crying at their desks. This turned into a meme of sorts, because I'm sure those cases were egregious and not the norm. The constant reciting of the leadership principles is kind of culty.

Culturally speaking, Microsoft is really different than when I worked there before the MBA. With Satya at the helm of the ship, the sniping, competitiveness, and political infighting that plagued Microsoft has largely subsided.

"While most reasonable people would agree, Seattle isn't a vacuum. These policies will only exacerbate the problem by attracting homeless people from other areas. Seattle homeless crisis right now is the product not of home-grown increases in homelessness, but homeless people from other areas (many receiving one-way bus tickets from other municipalities in lieu of criminal convictions) coming here. 

These coddling measures will only attract additional homeless people and worsen the issue. The City Council is putting the comfort of 4,000 homeless people in front of the safety of 700,000 Seattleites. It's easy to think about this in the abstract, but be honest with yourself: would you want this literally in your front yard (syringes, garbage, feces, and all) and there's nothing you can do about it? Because that's a real possibility.

"I simply gave an explanation for why I thought others were down-voting, I did not do so myself. 

As for the assertion about punishing the country with Trump, let's be honest here, the election for WA is over. The primary was our only real election and the DNC fucked over the progressive liberals here that wanted Sanders to have a fair fight. It doesn't matter who any one person in this state votes for as the democrat is likely to win regardless. If Trump is elected, it won't be because of any desire to punish the DNC, it'll be because Clinton failed to win key swing states (because she's kinda of a shitty candidate) and that has nothing to do with my vote or what Bush did.

As for blowing up the economy, Bill Clinton signed the The Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act (GLBA), also known as the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999, that in no small part led to the financial crises. He also failed to remove the Reagan appointed Fed Chair, Alan Greenspan, whose policies of low interest rates helped to blow up the housing bubble almost directly leading to the '08 crash. 

So again, voting against Clinton is a vote against politicians that enable corporate malfeasance and the billionaire class, and that is something I will happily stand behind regardless of who wins (because it doesn't matter, the rest of us always lose).",,,,eran76,Whittier Heights,,1475542738,t5_2qhad,t3_55o88s,t1_d8ctc70,13,1478340007,0,0,d8cx3lh,Seattle,,,flair

"I don't really know that it was a good or fair article.  I think the truth is likely a bit more complex.  I don't know much about either candidate, and the first I heard of this was a KUOW story a couple of days ago about how Walkinshaw's new ad was a stark contrast to the civil tone of the campaign so far.

Here are my thoughts:

*   The article focuses on a couple of harsh quotes, such as ""Trump-like.""  Fortunately, it also provides a link to the Jayapal web page in question.  That page is full of relevant specifics about why Jayapal's supporters think Walkinshaw's ad was misleading.  I was surprised that the writer of the article didn't include any of these specifics out of fairness.  If I had just read that page without the article, I certainly wouldn't have thought it represented bullying.

* There are many things I don't know about either candidate.  However, Jayapal says that the ads come from ""dark money.""  It would be interesting to know if this were true, but the article doesn't address this.

* The term ""Trump-style""attack ad is probably an exaggeration, but I'm not sure that it's wholly wrong - and the context clearly matters.  A man who obviously passes for white (as I do) attacks Jayapal not just for her attendance record (which, let's agree, is pretty staple attack ad fodder of questionable relevance), but also focuses on her getting funding from New York City.  I don't know that I'd exactly characterize this as a dog whistle, but it certainly focuses on Jayapal's otherness.  In addition, Walkinshaw's primary pre-government experience is from the Establishmentiest non-profit around, the Gates Foundation - in start contrast to Jayapal's lengthy history.  

* Walkinshaw is 32 years old, inexperienced, and was losing badly.  He ratcheted up with a negative and questionable ad, that if not a dog whistle, certainly looks a bit like one to people of color (including me).  In response to his vague attacks on Jayapal (New York!), she counters by ratcheting up with a kind of attack by association (Trump-like!) of her own.  In other words, this certainly doesn't appear to be a vast over-reaction to a perfectly reasonable and substantive ad.  In other words, Jayapal seems to be slinging mud back at Walkinshaw.

* So was Walkinshaw's ad Trump-like?  I guess, in that a relatively inexperienced man attacks - without a lot of data - a relatively experienced woman for her government experience.  But it's probably more accurate to say that it's a fairly typical negative campaign ad which has a long and dubious history long before Trump stepped into politics.  The ""otherness"" part of the ad is certainly present, but is a far cry from Trump's nastier moments.  On the other hand, the Walkinshaw's ad has very little useful information.  Legislative attendance records in legislatures are about as predictive of effectiveness as attendance at college lectures is predictive of final grades.  ""Look!  I saw her snapchat from New York when she should have been in class!""

* Again, I know very little about each candidate and have no idea who I'm going to vote for.  But this article doesn't really inform my decision in any real way.

 * It's certainly curious to me to see a man describing a woman (and her female supporters) who founded a non-profit called ""Hate Free Zone"" to help protect the rights of people of color attack the woman for being a bully *for her response to* a very negative attack ad late in the campaign by another man.

EDIT: I will say that the one service provided by this ""fair and balanced"" attack article was that it made look deeper into the substance of each candidate.  That itself is a good thing.  Also, it occurs to me that, if all the hoopla about Jayapal is true (Wikipedia sez she was lauded as a ""Champion of Courage"" by the White House for her work on behalf of immigrants) then this is probably what set off her supporters, who probably felt that her substantial accomplishments were being minimized by a sleazy attack ad.   So it's probably not the wisest election cycle for any guy to minimize the accomplishments of an experienced woman in politics. BUT I don't actually know anything about her accomplishments (or his) other than Wikipedia.  What's clear is that they both have good establishment creds (his Princeton to her Georgetown and Northwestern, etc.), but she's spent a bit more time outside the ""establishment reservation"" than he has.

"Thanks for the question! Sound Transit Proposition 1 provides transportation solutions for Renton and other Eastside communities, and provides them early in the plan. For 3+ years transit planners, advocacy groups and residents crafted a plan that includes building out different modes of transportation where they’re able to be most effective. People who live and work in Renton and Newcastle will be served well by bus rapid transit, with new stations at VMAC and a new transit center near hwy 167, and Metro Rapid Ride connections between them, serving the Boeing plant and downtown Renton, and continuing on the the Sounder Station on the border of Renton and Tukwila. There’s also increased parking, and capital improvements to South Sounder to speed up travel times and move 40% more riders.


Bus rapid transit along I-405 will provide an important connection to employment centers and key destinations in seven cities (Burien, Tukwila, Renton, Bellevue, Kirkland, Bothell, and Lynnwood) opening in 2024 with 10 minute headways. Those using bus rapid transit will also have the option of connecting to the light rail “spine” from three stops (Tukwila International Blvd Station, Downtown Bellevue, and Lynnwood Transit Center). The transit travel times from the NE 44th St station will be 16 minutes to the Downtown Bellevue Light Rail Station and 19 minutes to the Tukwila International Blvd Station.


Proposition 1’s bus rapid transit uses reliable HOT (high occupancy toll) lanes and have dedicated bus-only off-ramp at a new bus station near the NE 44th Street exit along with 200 more parking stalls.  The South Renton bus rapid transit station will include 700 parking spaces.  We’ll also seek to create new mixed-used development around the station that aligns with community goals.

No. I'm directly confronting your selfish worldview. ""We have one of the highest car tabs in the country."" Yes, and? We also have one of the highest median household incomes in the country. I pay $18.75/mo for one of my vehicles (yes! I'm selfish and own two cars too!) and the other I don't know off hand. In exchange, I get to drive on an insanely interconnected, albeit poorly maintained, road network that allows me to get anywhere I want to go with relative ease and efficiency. That it's ONLY $225/year for that vehicle is shocking to me.

Look, I'm all for reigning in surplus and stupid spending and the taxation that enables it, but public transit, education, and infrastructure need all the money they can get, and as a city we can afford it. Paying a fraction of a percent of my income for the  privilege of owning a car to get around is a pittance.

You're being selfish because people like myself who plan to be here long-term will benefit tremendously from expanded public transit, even if we don't use it as heavily as some, but since you're not going to be here that long you're saying ""Screw future Seattlites, doesn't benefit me so I'm out.""

"Really? Tons of harassment? I didn't witness any harassment, mostly just a quickening of pace while walking by because it's a little awkward and inconvenient to be scooting around an encampment on a sidewalk on the busiest street on campus. Like I said in my comment, I have encountered many nice homeless people who are just trying to get by in life, like the rest of us. I used to volunteer at UGM in Pioneer Square, so I know the varieties of people that end up in the unfortunate circumstance of homelessness. I worked the front desk, and was cursed at, spat on, called names, harassed, aggressively hit on, etc. It was exhausting, and I was just trying to help out. It was the people who really appreciated what you would try to do for them with limited resources that made my experience worth while, but the few bad apples so to speak, made the experience a little hellish. I feel for homeless people, it's a scary place to be, but there's no doubt the system is abused by many. I think anyone who is unsure should go volunteer at a place like UGM in Pioneer Square and see for yourself. I hope the city can manage to help ways that aren't just going to uproot them and dump them in another place, but there is no simple solution.  One of the reasons we all go to the park is to find peace and serenity in nature, escaping the concrete jungle of the city. By allowing homeless encampments, I feel like we would no longer have the parks to really escape, and ultimately degrading the community spaces we all share &amp; respect.

"&gt; We also know that ridesharing can complement public transportation by providing a reliable and convenient first and last mile solution. Today in London, 34% of Uber trips start or end within 200 meters of the Metro. In Paris it’s 65%.

&gt; This is the future of transportation. There will be less car ownership and people will come to rely more on a mix of mass transit and other transport options to get where they need to go, even as self-driving vehicles become a bigger part of the picture.

There, in Uber's own words, is why ""but... driverless cars"" isn't a valid reason to vote down mass transit.

"I'm all for helping out the homeless, but I don't believe that this is the way to do it. I'm a student in the U-district, and when we had the ""tent city"" on the Ave sidewalk, it was pretty disruptive. I know most homeless aren't criminals, and I'm not trying to label them as such, but being a student at the UW for 3 years now, I have witnessed some pretty disturbing things. There was a 3 year old child and newborn baby living on the sidewalk in a tent in the freezing cold. It's hard to walk a couple of blocks anywhere without seeing a couple needles or empty drug baggies. I went outside my apartment one night to find a guy sitting on my stoop changing the dressing on his stab wound, and he talked to me about how he just found out that he has HIV and his stab wound is infected.  As a young female student, I can't say this exactly makes me feel safe. At one point I saw 2 homeless guys dismantling about 10 bikes in an empty building's parking lot, obviously stolen. Sidewalks and parks are there for the community to enjoy and relax in, not intended for housing thousands of homeless people. And from a public health standpoint, if one of the main reasons for shutting down the Jungle is because of biohazard and litter/waste and because several people have been victims of homicide and robbery in the area, then why do we want to spread that into every single Seattle neighborhood and our beautiful parks? Seattle already has a bad homeless problem, this just seems as though we are inviting more people to come stay in our city by designating so much land for encampments. There has to be a reason why homeless is getting worse and worse, and I think it's because the city doesn't really ""crack down,"" on it.

People who claim that buses are the answer are...sheltered, perhaps. Maybe they've never been to a city with real, reliable mass transit. Buses are nice, and are definitely part of the overall people-moving solution, but they cannot replace nor compete with rail. There's simply no comparison. A region that has rail is more connected, with more infrastructure and less dependency on autos. Period. Buses use the same road as all of us. If you think you're stuck in bad traffic now, just wait 10 years. Then you, I, and all the shiny new buses will be idling on our freeways for hours per day.

Take a look around the country at (1) stadiums, (2) ""arterial highway improvements,"" (3) parks and recreation and (4) low-income housing that were built in the 1960s and 1970s.

With the benefit of hindsight, we can say that these projects were not well conceived and in many cases were disastrous. There are some cities that still haven't recovered from blowing up neighborhoods to make a better off-ramp, or piling all of a city's poor into government housing.

"Seattle has undergone a radical transformation in the last 15+ years. Lots of people are moving here to work in tech. That's driving up the demand for housing. The median house price is $630k. Average rent for a one bedroom is $2k. New unit construction hasn't kept pace. I think I saw a slide that said 40 people move to Seattle every day, but we only build 11 housing units a day. 


It's also been difficult to build affordable housing.
