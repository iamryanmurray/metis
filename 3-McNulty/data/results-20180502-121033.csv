Almost half are transported to Western Europe. Roughly a quarter end up in the United States. Human rights activists say the numbers do not tell the full story, because most women remain silent rather than turn to frequently corrupt authorities for help.""](http://www.nbcnews.com/id/3071965/ns/us_news-only/t/infiltrating-europes-shameful-trade-human-beings/#.VAJ9S2SwKW4

"&gt; Anyone with half a brain knows that when you throw together a couple million people violence and crime is going to happen.

Hence why three black teenagers, Billy Chambers, Kenneth Kelly and Ja'mari Alexander-Alan Jones were able to savagely curb-stomp Edward McMichael—a well-known street musician known as the “Tuba Man""—to his death in 2008. 

Here was a defenseless old man, being kicked to death by three teenagers, having his last breaths beaten out of him with the soles of their shoes. 

In the real world, we call this savagery, and take precautions to make sure it never happens to any of our loved ones or to innocent citizens. Some of us carry guns because we care—even about liberals who would grudgingly take a beating from thugs and punks to protect their worldview of political correctness.  

Jones is in prison for murder in shooting up a Bellevue bar; Chambers will be in prison until 2018—possibly to be released earlier—for his own gun crime; and Kelly will be out soon, too, also in for gun (and drug) crimes.

Sadly, all of these multiple-felon scum will be back on our streets in short time. And liberals will cry about disparate impact and ""The New Jim Crow.""

These putrid creatures deserved a firing squad or lethal injection years ago. 

Or take the Christian-hating punk who shot students at Seattle Pacific University last year.

"&gt; You can't go to the fan base and ask for the moon when you are serving shit on a shingle.

Really? Cause Sacramento and Milwaukee both did it recently, and successfully. They are keeping their teams and they suck balls and have for quite awhile.

&gt; Howard Schultz is a tool for believing the OKC ownership group ever intended to keep the team here. I still wont buy his coffee.

If you think he genuinely believed that you're dreaming. He knew they were gone when he sold to them.

&gt; Owning a team shouldn't be looked at as a profiting generating center.

I'm sorry...what? That's absolutely ridiculous. Paul Allen doesn't own the Hawks and Blazers because it's fun, he does it for the money, the fact that it is fun is a bonus.

&gt;  It isn't a year to year make money investment. You suffer losses until it comes time to sell the team and you make big bucks.

Really? Because only 8 NBA teams currently don't make money year over year. I agree the long term investment is the big money, but the claim that year to year profit isn't a huge factor in ownership is just untrue.

&gt; If he shopped the team a little longer I believe local owners would have stepped up.

"&gt; An exasperated federal judge warned Thursday that the Seattle Police Department could be under court supervision until 2019 unless it significantly improves the progress of reforms that have lagged as a result of missed deadlines and mismanagement.

&gt;&gt;“What will not be tolerated is a lack of will,” U.S. District Judge James Robart said during a 2 ½-hour hearing in which he bluntly listed “areas of concerns to me” and lamented breakdowns in the city’s 2012 agreement with the Department of Justice to curb excessive force and biased policing.

This was said in April, 2014, just a few weeks ago.  It's going to be a very long time before I find anything *funny* about the SPD.  Keep in mind that the courts usually bend over backward to protect police departments.  And, the DOJ's investigation wasn't about a few incidents.  The DOJ reported that the SPD exhibits a *pattern* of excessive force and biased policing.  A **pattern**.

For this federal judge to speak so harshly about the SPD ... there really should be no doubt, at this point, in any Seattle resident's mind that the SPD is behaving recklessly and dangerously.

Many Seattle residents, including me, feel our chests constrict in fear when we see Seattle officers.  I'm not a criminal, I've never been arrested, and I was an MP in the Army Reserve.  But, my chest constricts, my mouth goes dry, and I wonder if this is it, this is the officer who's going to blow off some steam by ruining my day/life.  

I haven't seen any SPD officers marching to City Hall demanding that their Chief of Police and other senior officers quickly move forward with the reforms.  I haven't seen the Police Union publicly calling for the department to reform so that the SPD might repair its reputation and regain some respectability.  Not a peep from the officers.

We'll have time for ""funny"" *after* they reform their department.  ",false,true,t1_ch7y2z8,CaliforniaLibre,,0,1399057257,t5_2qhad,t3_24jzrq,t1_ch7xbig,-17,1433623004,0,0,ch7y2z8,Seattle,-17,,,

"Protip: if you have to pretend to not be racist by saying ""I've had black friends,"" you're a fucking racist.

The fact that you don't understand how blacks are disproportionately discriminated against through economics reveals how ignorant you really are. Economics works against the vulnerable and poor, who are proportionately Hispanic or black minorities.

Don't think we have racial discrimination today? You must be an upper middle class white person to be so blind and ignorant to ongoing injustices.

Seattle has a long history of racist segregation laws, discrimination against black renters, and prohibiting blacks from homeownership.

The ""Google Bus"" protests are pretty ridiculous (those buses are good for the environment and workers, and the people who ride them are harmless middle-class tech workers who don't hurt anyone) but the anti-Uber sentiment I understand. Uber is evil and I hope it fails.

"I couldn't agree more. The problem in this area is that nobody cares if they are breaking the speed limit (except for you and me, it seems, and a few other people ITT) because they know there is zero chance of being penalized for it. 

One of the most infuriating things is that people pull this shit on trails that are, in some places, *immediately adjacent* to roads with bike lanes, where the speed limit is far higher than any cyclist could ride for an extended period of time. If you want to sprint, there's a place for that. If you're so fit that you can actually ride 25mph for a whole century-- which believe me, most of the pudgy dick-compensating idiots who speed on the trail probably couldn't-- there's a place for that.

Every time I look at Strava after a ride that was fully on the trails, it makes me angry. My average speed is typically pretty much exactly the speed limit of the trail, unless I went for a ride at a crowded time. I'm 1/2 to 3/4 of the way down in the rankings for segments on the trails, which is fucked up.

Bye Seattle, it was...conflicting. Enjoy having those two(2!) whole cannabis shops sell you 15-30/g, the two days of the month they are open, where you can stand in a line outside, be filmed, and then be restricted to 2 grams and maybe an edible for some astronomical sum.

Will their need just disappear, because a court said so (or the WSLCB, who spent almost the entire time between the vote and now trying to destroy medical cannabis...and they did SUCH a wonderful job with those two (2!) whole cannabis stores, with their 2 gram limits, reasonable prices, no line outside where you get filmed, and uptime somewhere near 4%! Wonderful, massive success!  World renowned!)

"I'm being completely honest when I say, cyclists are really, really, really in the way of drivers when they decide to ride in the lane. If you fall and we're unable to stop in time, we're at fault if we hit you, and it won't just be a simple fender bender. You could potentially die. It's the same issue when cyclists stay in the lane but then go off to the far right. It's difficult to pass you unless we can go in the other lane. When it comes down to it, cyclists just can't move fast or safely enough to be in the midst of automobile traffic. 

If you're going to ride your bike in the lane, you need to act like a car. Cyclists constantly weave in and out through stopped traffic. When you cut in front of people and go to the front of the lane, or get up on the sidewalk to bypass a light, all it does is piss people off. You're the little shit that cuts in line behaving like that, and no one likes it. I have no problem with cyclists, but there is a significant elitist, for lack of a better term, attitude amongst the cycling crowd here in Seattle and that's why you experience this behavior from people driving cars. There needs to be a dedicated lane, or people need to stay on the sidewalk when riding their bike.

Agreed, but the biker was in control of the situation by the time the car was stopped. Only he could have acted to prevent the collision at that point.

&gt; The point I was trying to make (the poster above me had edited his comment) was that* legally*, the cyclist was not in the wrong - the car had the responsibility to yield to oncoming traffic (bikes included).

Sure. And the white car shouldn't have stopped to let the blue car in. That's generally a no-no. But 

&gt; But legally at fault? Nope.

Are you talking about what would pass in a court case? Perhaps. The fact is he he *purposefully* hit that blue car when he could have avoided it. That. Is. Wrong. If you think it's cool for a court to gloss over that fact then whatever, I guess. There's no justice in the world.

Same thing applies to restaurants, food shops (groceries, butchers, bakers), gas stations, and basically every aspect of our retail lives that are regulated.

Said ""joke"" is in reply to the topic of the dude in question verbally assaulting women, which isn't really the right subthread for a joke, especially that joke.

The ""joke"" in question is a variant of ""was she asking for it?"" by merely existing and being of a certain attribute, which is basic victim blaming 101. It's like if someone had said ""that dude raped me"" and PissedOnMyLeg replied ""did you ask for it by wearing a short skirt?""

The dude doesn't *need* anything from another human, and it isn't cool to reply to a serious complaint with a joke that way.

This subreddit seems to be utterly ignorant on any issue concerning lower income human beings, thus pointing out the true sign of a spineless coward. Too spineless to be upfront about their ignorant bigotry, so they hide like a child behind coded language. No, none of them have been to Detroit. Most of them have probably never left the safety of their mothers' basements. This is why Seattle isn't progressive - we have the country's most regressive taxes. And Seattle libertarians are saints? The libertarians are in control here, with their anti-taxes, anti-public investment, anti-public education, anti-public transit, worship-the-corporate bullshit.

Seattleites are the most close-minded, defensive, sensitive, arrogant city-priders there are. They can't take any criticism whatsoever due to their fragile egos and spinelessness. They are trying SO HARD to prove to everyone they are worth something, they are incapable of processing any sort of criticism or self-reflecting. Thus, we get passive-aggressive, narrow minded Seattle Freeze types.

"I'm sick and tired of what Amazon has done to SLU, LQA, Cap Hill, and Belltown. I've watched my neighborhood get its heart scooped out, one spoonful at a time due to rising rent. 

Rent rises because of the insane population surge from new Amazon workers. Speculators like Diamond Parking raise the rent on places they think they can build new, sterile, shitty People Boxes like AVA and other craptastic eyesores. 

Further problems like CVS Drugs taking down Kid Valley burger when only a block away, locally owned Bartell Drugs has a location (not to mention the one just up QA Ave exist.) Chase Bank builds a branch where the iconic Easy Street Records resided. Silver Platters Records closed because the rent went through the roof, but now nobody will occupy their former location for the same reason. The Fun House got torn down for a shitty apartment complex with no style, The Jam Box, destroyed for another sterile tenement. To be closer to the new center of things, the worst crime of all was committed by the Korean Consulate when it bought the building The Streamline Tavern is located, whose final days are around January 2nd, '15. 

Amazon's employees may not see it, but the presence of their headquarters so close to these neighborhoods has caused an awful change in our city. Looking at photos I took around town in 2009 compared to today, the changes are starkly obvious.

"Thank you for being one of the voices of reason in this terrible racist and often sexist sub. This city seems full of brogrammer assholes born into a life of cushy privilege that are pushing out diversity, poor and people of color as they continue to gentrify Capital Hill. They think they lifted themselves up out of Galts Gulch by getting a STEM degree and have no idea of the oppression they have forced POCs, LGBTAs, and our otherkin allies. They reek of a baseless normative judgment. Modern, civilized, advanced liberal democracies founded on the right to be guarded from state violence and intrusion would disagree with their normative opinion and actively trying trying to shut down all local-owned small business bookstores. Undercutting and killing competition is Amazon's business model, and isn't good for local small business bookstores. 

White racial ignorance is not an uncommon problem in homogenous places like Seattle. A lack of exposure to diverse cultures typically produces narrow minded, tribalistic nationalism - just like what 4chan advocates. Nationalism is a refuge of reactionary fundamentalists who fear difference and clutch to the familiar due to their inflexible and poor cognitive biases.

LA and New York  are world-class, multicultural hubs of a citys. Seattle is a sleepy suburban-residential city.

"That's s rad!  Honestly.  I have to give credit where credit is due to people who actually fight back against greedy business owners.  But what I don't get is why, if you're such an advocate for the working person, would you EVER be against May Day demonstrations???  The only logical conclusion I can think of is that you have no idea what they are truly about and simply base your opinions on media stereotypes.  Your insults are another clue to this being the case.  Oh, because I support the labor movement I'm now a ""protest warrior hipster dipshit""?  You don't know me. 

You think that because you filed a lawsuit that the rest of the world should be like ""May Day parade is cancelled guys!  This waitress in NYC is taking care of it!""  You're the one that is delusional if you think what you're doing is going to make the bigger difference.  May Day demonstrations are going to be on every major news outlet on the planet and if we can *somehow* convince the media to portray the real message and not just ""anarchists smash windows! OMG!!"" then real change will begin.  But as of now I think millions marching in the streets will send a little bit bigger of a message than the gothamist.

So again I ask, if you really do care about the working people in your industry, why would you not use May Day as a chance to stand with thousands of people who would support your view and turn it in to an even bigger movement?  The service industry has a massive voice in this event.  Why berate it when you can help move it forward?

The reason I referred to you as Bill Oreilly is that you literally spit out the exact same generalized and misinformed opinions on this subject that he does.  This quote from you:

&gt;It's never just one person. It's entire groups while all their adorable little friends watch and don't bother to stop them. For the most part, they aren't effectively communicating a cohesive message that would appeal to anyone except for farm kids from the Midwest who are now Seattleite hipster ""anarchists.""

Is a perfect example of something someone would say who has spent any amount of time in the streets.

"I lived in the South for a bit too. You'll want to avoid the following behaviors: 

- Don't give excessive (or really any) compliments. They make people nervous and suspicious. They will respond to a compliment by either arguing with you outright ""Oh it's not really like that..."" or by straight up insulting you ""You just like everything"" ""You're always so positive even when it doesn't apply"" ""Just wait until you know a little more..."" I don't think they realize that they are responding to something you said to try to be nice in a way that makes you look stupid for liking it. They just really don't do compliments here. Silence is all the compliment you need. 

- Don't exchange pleasantries. As someone else has already mentioned, ""Oh it's so nice when the sun comes out"" or whatever you say to ""talk for the sake of talking..."" Yeah. No. You don't want to do that. It makes people uncomfortable. 

- Don't dress up. It bothers people. They moved to Seattle so they could wear whatever the hell they want without judgment. If you dress up, you'll ruin the vibe for everyone. Any asshole in a suit could well be the one that starts this town on the slide toward corporate hell. (Pro tip: the irony of judging people for what they wear and policing everyone's outfits is not a topic they will enjoy). 

- Unless absolutely necessary, don't break the silence. Most people are trained to consider a silence an uncomfortable situation to be remedied. Most introverts, and Seattle has a lot of introverts, consider it their desperately needed solace to recharge and recover. They will sit next to you and say nothing and walk away thinking you're a nice person. As long as you don't try to make them talk. Silence is the social lubricant of the introvert. 

- Don't be picky about service. If you walk into a coffee shop and the table is dirty, wipe it yourself or deal with the dirt. DON'T ask the barista. And in any service situation, you want to try to avoid ever asking for anything. Don't ask for extra napkins, lemons for your water, or a seat by the window. Don't ask how long it will be before your entrees come out or if you can substitute a salad for the fries. It's seen as entitled (it is entitled, really. It's just allowed in most other places). Anything you can or can't do will be explained on the menu. If it's not there. You can't do it. Deal. If you absolutely have to have something HINT rather than ask. ""I would order the steak but we HAVE TO CATCH A SHOW IN AN HOUR so I don't want to order anything that takes too long. The sole should be fine, right?"" Your server will respond as if you threatened to stab her unless your meal is finished in an hour. ""Here's your appetizer, and your meal will be finished in an hour... Here's your entrees, and did I mention your meal will be finished in an hour..."" and so on. At least in my experience. The hint really works. So use it sparingly. Also, be aware that your server is judging you for failing to plan more time for your meal. 

- Don't be late. Or be in a rush. Failing to ""leave a few extra minutes so you don't have to hurry"" is very much frowned upon here. If someone is moving quickly because, perhaps, she doesn't want to spend all damn day on the goddamm sidewalk in the rain and people walk so slowly in this town that it almost defies what is possible under our current understanding of the laws of physics... yeah. The person moving faster than anyone else will get a LOT of judgey looks, and sometimes outright sabotage by the really judgey types. ""You don't mind waiting, right?"" they will say triumphantly as they STAND on the escalator BLOCKING everyone else. ""We're all going to the same place at the top, right?""  These are not really questions. They are social cues to let you know that you are not allowed to shorten your escalator time by using it as it is intended - fast stairs. It is now a slow elevator. Because they planned ahead. This planning allows them to give themselves the time to stand there like freaking logs. I don't know why the ability to spend more time on an escalator is anyone's idea of living the good life, but it is what it is. Don't rush. 

PS - for the love of Christ. None of this is a complaint. Except the part about the escalators because any adult should know you walk on something that LOOKS LIKE STAIRS. The freak out is  amusing but also puzzling. And downvotes just confirm that 1) These behaviors are beloved here. And 2) No one wants to break the silence to explain why. Cheers :) Oh, and the only thing that really bothers me is the slowness. The rest is charming, if sometimes a bit much. The slowness really drives me insane, but just because I don't want to spend any more than I have to the limited amount of time I have on earth on a goddam escalator.

"&gt; So you're a typical materialistic soulless cunt.

People unable to break away from being used by rich people will always claim those who desire or who can break away are ""materialistic"". It's a simple defense mechanism.

Money is a byproduct, it isn't the goal. The goal is not to be used like an oxen or horse. All jobs listed take a sliver of the total wealth created by that job. They are being used, meaning they aren't successful. Success is a statement of independence.

"Here is the summary:

The car driver didn't do anything wrong.  There is nothing they could have done to avoid the accident.

The bike rider is riding too fast for conditions.  Driving significantly faster than the traffic around him is dangerous.  That's why the biker hit the car.

In a 37 second video the biker hits a car and nearly hits 2 pedestrians.  This is the definition of Reckless Driving.

After watching the video, I think the following needs to happen: 

*  Bike Riders need to have a **Bike Driving License** to ensure they are aware of all the laws and how to ride a bike in traffic
* Bike Riders need to be **registered**, with a license plate on the rear of their bike.  That way if they hit a car and ride off, the car driver can record the offending license plate
* Bike Riders need to have **insurance**.  This is in case they hit a car, or get in an accident.  If they cause 10k to a Ferrari, and don't have the funds to repair it, then it will hit their insurance.

EDIT:  Also, I don't think there should be street parking in Downtown.  If there weren't parked cars, the driver could have seen the biker, even though the biker was driving too fast and ""appeared out of nowhere"".  I also think the road and signage is completely fucked, and needs to be entirely re-worked.",false,true,t1_cjxi3ji,bepdub,,0,1408720424,t5_2qhad,t3_2e79ql,t3_2e79ql,-12,1427409889,0,0,cjxi3ji,Seattle,-12,,,

"Thank goodness someone else said this. I read this thread last night shortly after I got the alert (which only vibrated for me like a phone call and no shrieking - iphone here...) and as a parent to a 3-year old girl, it made me so sad to read these people being so relieved to be able to turn off the alert and not deal with it. I had to close the thread at the idea that all these *poor, inconvenienced* people would no longer get the alert if my baby went missing into this big, anonymous world. 

So thanks for saying something about it - as a parent, it made me feel better to see at least someone care that someone else's baby is missing. 

PS - for anyone interested in the actual details, it was/is a relative who is suspected of being an unmedicated paranoid schizophrenic who has taken a 9-year old boy and the boy is believed to be in a lot of danger. They share a last name, so I'm guessing relative, and I just woke up so I have not checked to see whether they've recovered the boy yet. But that's the info I looked up last night shortly after I received the alert.

"&gt; Yes, I ride and don't assume that a car is going to follow the law. Rule #1.

I don't have that expectation either.

The problem here is these drivers who are breaking the law are going to continue to cause collisions, and possibly even fatalities, with cyclists. Most, if not all, of the cyclists on 2nd Avenue are not experienced cyclists because experience teaches cyclists in Seattle to stay off of 2nd Avenue.

&gt; Give it a little bit of time. Some of them seemed clearly confused about the new change. Like the car who gets out in it stops, realizes he's blocking the lane and proceeds.

&gt; Reminds me of a ticket I talked myself out of, ""Officer, I lived on this street for 19 years and that was always a yield sign. Today it's a stop. Sorry. Won't happen again.""

I can kind of understand why you might initially miss a yield sign changing to a stop sign. Both are about the same size and color and your brain is used to seeing the yield sign. The intersection was not sufficiently different for you to notice.

But in this instance, there's a brand new traffic light next to the existing one with a red left arrow. It looks completely different. The paint on the street looks different. With so much of the intersection looking different, how do most people not stop for a moment and observe the new signal and the sign above it? This is my first time looking at this intersection as well and I had no trouble figuring out how it is supposed to work.

The problem on 2nd Avenue is still pretty serious. In your example of mistaking a stop sign for a yield sign, the intersection still worked similarly and you weren't likely to injure someone with your mistake. But with the way drivers are ignoring these new turn signals, cyclists are still going to be at extreme risk once the construction on the 2nd Avenue bike lane is complete. Also, don't get me wrong here -- this intersection is very poorly designed. That was part of the reason I posted it.

"are you kidding me? unless it's a bigger privately owned chain (like trader joes) or a bigger non-franchised national chain, the average mom and pops store would have to increase their prices just to make a god damn living (unless they're running it by themselves with no outside labor) or else they are fine with making less...

And HAHAHAHAHA. You're talking about cost of goods and minimum wage increase. Cost of goods is the price they (the retailers) buy the products for and Consumer prices/retail prices is the cost that we pay for the goods... Someone sure talks big when they don't even know the vocabulary.

And ya. I'll say it. There IS a 1:1 increase in the retail prices vs cost of labor unless they can eat the smaller profit margins. Ever wonder why most things are manufactured in Asia? It definitely ISN'T the cheap labor costs and lax regulations over there. /s

These kids are shitty assholes because they've been raised with zero role models, most likely coming from generations of families living in destitution in physical/financial insecurity. People are only somewhat domesticated and when you raise them in an insecure environment, they get raised in ""survival mode"" and turn violent like these kids.

It is NOT some black subculture based stemming from an ethnic tendency, like you and other racists love to assume.

"Wrong. Development trends are spurred by all sorts of factors, not just where you lay rails, and many a transit system has found itself suboptimal or irrelevant because once rails are laid, they stay laid.

The classic example is the Washington DC Metrorail system.

A very expensive system to move people into the District from Virginia and Maryland. Fast forward 30 years and the topography of the rail system made it obsolete -- now a majority of commuting trips occurred around the periphery of the city, between points on the Beltway -- but the Metrorail is worthless in that context. 

Now it's a great system for taking tourists in to see the memorials and getting a few federal workers to their desks, but many more commuters are stuck in traffic on the Beltway all day, every day.

Stop apologizing to the people you have mislead. They chose to follow and it is not your fault that they did not have the moral strength to resist the false salvation of your past self. People are lazy, like turds in a toilet, they will always gravitate to  the easy answers to life's persistent problems.

You are free Mike. Raise your head and look at the endless horizons of humanity's possibilities. Yes, there are terrible things to come in our  unpredictable future. Wars will still be fought over natural resources and religion. But you can still make a difference. Now that you are hollow and without faith, you see the world for what it is.

The final legal challenges he made were about the funding, but he was playing the soothsayer role a long time before that. If the city had gone with a replacement for the raised viaduct, I guarantee you that McGinn would have also fought against that.

You cannot tell me that this isn't a thread of people patting themselves on the back for knowing the incredibly simple rules of how to use an apostrophe. It is a stupid thing to feel superior about and an even stupider thing to judge somebody for.

I don't think ignorance can rightly be a mode of regarding something. In fact I think it is typified by the inability to regard something.

I can pretty much do whatever I want. I usually roll into work around 9 or 10AM and leave around 3-4PM...it's been like this for a few years now. My job is relatively kushy. Most of my friends are transplants, who also have money and don't know the city so it's nice to be able to connect with them. 

I don't really keep an exact budget, but it seems like no matter how much I spend, I always have $1,500+ at the end of every month minimum...so I'm not too worried about it. 

I spend pretty recklessly at bars, and eat most of my meals out. I am single, and have no girlfriend. Right now my biggest expense is buying new clothes and furnishing my apartment in crazy ways. I am not limited by budget, I am just limited by finding things I like. I just got a gym membership too. 

Life is good! :-) I am 24, quickly accruing wealth and definitely tend to have more money compared with the average Seattleite. I don't work a lot, get paid a lot, and only seem to continue getting raises. 

I often times feel bad for people who aren't making as much and have to commit a ton more time to work for way less money. I literally just have so much leisure time to snowboard, eat out, brunch with friends, exercise because I work almost exactly 40 hours a week, less if I can keep it that way. 

I can't wait till I get a girlfriend so I can spend more of my money going on vacations, etc but that will definitely hit the bank.",false,true,t1_chduv8s,platformoderati,,0,1399662068,t5_2qhad,t3_255dzd,t3_255dzd,-10,1433725289,1,0,chduv8s,Seattle,-10,,,

"""This new law doesn't stop criminals from buying illegal firearms illegally. It only hurts the innocent.""

Not at all, by closing down the way firearms make their way from legal owners to ""known scumbags"" it makes it far more difficult for a casual criminal to easily get their hands on a weapon. Impossible? No. But far more difficult and expensive, yes.

....Assuming the criminal and/or person selling to criminal doesn't just drive across state border to evade whole thing to begin with. Which is why loophole needs to be closed nationwide. Until then it is a step, if Oregon &amp; Idaho and more states surrounding WA pass similar laws then it will ""pad"" our borders in the meantime.

Then the dude starts YELLING at me.. ""OH MY GOD, I THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA RUN ME OVER, blah blah mwah mwah mwah"".  Starts lecturing me about watching out for bicyclists, and all this bullshit.

I just looked at him and said ""Hey, I stopped well short of the cross walk, asshole.. maybe next time you should look up the laws on riding your bike on a crosswalk and SLOW THE FUCK DOWN.""  Then I peeled out and let him eat my exhaust.

First of all, a ""gentle leader"" is very different from a muzzle, doesn't prevent the dog from opening its mouth, and is *obviously not what I'm talking about*. However they're not safe if the dog is prone to lunging after a squirrel / suddenly changing directions / etc. Since they're attached to he front of the head they can snap the dog's neck around dangerously if it takes off suddenly. Leads like that should **only** be used for dogs that pull consistently but don't try to just take off, and even then, there are much better methods of training.


Secondly, any muzzle which prevents a dog from opening its mouth prevents it from panting, which is the primary method dogs use for regulating temperature. A muzzle should be loose enough that the dog can easily open its mouth enough to pant.

"Last night, I was driving home exhausted after finishing up a double shift at the docks. After a double shift, I usually go to the bar with the guys for an hour to have a beer, but my daughter has been sick and I wanted to get home sooner. Knowing what was about to happen, I wish I stayed.

The route from work to home is a simple one I've taken a million times and can do while on autopilot: take a right out of the parking lot, drive straight, turn left to get onto the bridge, take the third exit, and I'm basically home. The best part is if I cruise at the 35mph speed limit, I hit every single green light and can get home stress free and in good time. Maybe it was my exhaustion, maybe it was my sick daughter, but last night I decided I could pick things up a bit and get home a bit sooner if I sped up a bit. 

As I was approaching the third light I was pleased to see it was still green; given my speed increase I knew there was a risk of hitting a red light. I thought that I'd make a habit of my current pace and glanced down to see how fast I was going: 45mph. Not bad, ten over isn't unreasonable! I could do this more often with a fairly clean conscie...

When I looked back up there was a biker riding through the intersection. Above him was a green light. *My* green light. He must have judged he could get by safely and decided to run his light. Perhaps he misjudged how far away I was, or perhaps he thought I was going the speed limit. Or perhaps he just simply didn't know I was there. All I know is I didn't turn fast enough, didn't brake fast enough, didn't give him enough of a chance to live....

I kept driving, too shocked to do anything else. I could hardly see through the windshield, and lost a side mirror, but I was too shocked to care. When I got home, I sat in the car silently for a long time, forgetting all about my sick daughter and my long day at work. How could I think of such things? I had destroyed something all because I wanted to get home a bit faster. My life was over. *His* life was over. There was nothing I could do. Then again, what can you do if you're a monster?

**TLDR:** It was a mistake. I shouldn't have been speeding. He shouldn't have ran the light. I'm a monster.

***Disclaimer:*** *This isn't true*, I didn't hit anyone. I'm just using a novelty account to remind people that driving is one of the most dangerous things you can do.

"I would argue that the Connector is considerably more than a carpool service. Their buses and shuttles comprise one of the largest company-owned bus services in the US.

When these buses and shuttles become accessible in low-income areas, the incentive for Microsoft employees to move there and displace the existing population rises considerably, as anyone with an awful commute can attest. Displacement leads to gentrification, which leads to further displacement of the population that relies on lower-cost housing that they can afford. The easier Microsoft makes it for its employees to live in areas farther-flung or previously less accessible, the more likely they are to move there, often edging out the people who can't afford rising rents and home prices.",false,true,t1_ch0715l,jumbo_cactuar21,,0,1398284369,t5_2qhad,t3_23sckt,t1_ch056ja,-15,1433489178,0,0,ch0715l,Seattle,-15,,,

My only suggestion is to convey as much distain and disrespect to your assailant as possible, as rapidly as possible.

This is typically best done by ignoring them entirely, as though you cannot even see them or hear what they are saying, but if it comes to them banging on your window you will need to be more extreme.  Profanity, racial or classist slurs, and threats of violence **may** be useful depending on the circumstances.  This is effective against aggressive panhandler but **not** muggers, so be careful to figure out which you are dealing with.

It's a protest, it's supposed to cause trouble.

That's not how civil disobedience works. If you're not doing something that can get you thrown into jail you aren't being disobedient. 

Breaking windows is one of those things that I understand in some contexts and not in others. Showing up to a protest with that soul intention is pretty idiotic. Especially if you're going to do it to some local mom and pop store, which is just shitty. 

But that aside I have little sympathy for something like the Bank Of America. By all means, smash their fucking window.

"Ask yourself if you actually need internet at home that badly, or if it's actually worth the faustian bargain of using comcast.

Serious question: why do you *need* internet at home? What do you really use it for?

Do you have cell coverage at home? Clear wireless? For the price that most people are paying for comcast you can probably survive on wireless.

If a small fraction of people using comcast cancel their accounts or refuse to do service, they will get the attention of comcast's shareholders and board of directors.

If 50% or more of comcast's customer base suddenly cancels their service, it will likely drive comcast out of business. This will cancel municpal monopoly contracts and make room in the market for alternate providers.

Other ISPs would be salivating at the chance for your business.

People need to take a stand. Most people don't actually *need* internet at home. It's a nice thing and a luxury, a time saver and a comfort. But people can easily survive without it. There have been harder sacrifices to make. It's not like a hunger strike.

"Let me try to break this down pretty simply:

* More warehouses placed strategically across the US decreases shipping times. 

* Shipping times influences customers purchasing decisions. 

Pretty simple, huh?  My previous comments aren't specific to a decision based off of one individual purchase. Amazon doesn't care about one single purchase, they care about creating repeat customers who don't even think about shopping around. They want customers to purchase products on Amazon and only on Amazon. By decreasing shipping times on a global scale they accomplish that. 

If I buy stuff off of Amazon and routinely notice it takes 5 days to ship something, I may question my next purchasing decision on where to go. But if I suddenly start noticing that orders are delivered after 2 days then I won't question where to get it. Knowing the specific warehouse on an individual purchase doesn't matter, but creating a baseline dependable pattern does.

And some amazon warehouses reach up to 1.2 million square feet of space.  It may not have EVERY item, but it'll be a metric shitton the most popular for that region (hint: logistics).

"&gt;This city should be a place where you can safely ride a bike downtown.

Actually I think this attitude is the source of the problem.

When I was a kid my dad taught me rules about riding a bike on a road.

1) Always assume that cars are not paying attention, that they have not seen you and will run you over.

2) Always ride against traffic when possible.  For the very simple reason - you can see what is going to hit you.  If traffic is too dense to do that, you shouldn't be riding on that street.

3) Prefer sidewalks.  When talking road vs sidewalk, in both cases the bicyclist is doing the unexpected.  But the bicyclist can control things much easier on the sidewalk than in the street.  Car vs bicycle is almost always fatal to the bicyclist.

My personal belief is anyone riding a bike on Seattle streets is suicidal.
If you really want everyone using bikes in a city there should be dedicated bike paths.  Not lanes.. completely separate paths.  No cars, no pedestrians except at clearly marked crosswalks.
Short of that, keep the stockpile of body bags handy.

The benefit would be that the community would know that you are who you say you are, and your account would have a bit of text next to it (on /r/Seattle only) that would indicate your account has been verified.

Comparison 1: [Macbook Pro(s)](http://puu.sh/cD5pj/7346a68ceb.png) VS [Lenovo](http://shop.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/lenovo/y-series/y50/?sb=:000001C9:000120E3:) - respectable brand which are known for duability and once known for some of the best laptop keyboards if not the best on the entire market(not so much in this department anymore). Same price as the Macbook Pro(s) but triple the specs and even a 6 inch advantage(almost 50% larger) advantage on the screen size.

Comparison 2: [Macbook Pro(s)](http://puu.sh/cD5pj/7346a68ceb.png) VS [MSI](http://www.amazon.com/MSI-GP70-LEOPARD-010-9S7-175A12-010-17-3-Inch/dp/B00IQ4G8U8/ref=sr_1_4?s=pc&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1415121028&amp;sr=1-4&amp;keywords=laptop) - This one is only 899 so almost $300 cheaper than the Macbooks and again has way better specs, and again an almost 7 inch advantage on screen size.


Comparison 3: [Macbook Pro(s)](http://puu.sh/cD5pj/7346a68ceb.png)  VS [Acer](http://store.acer.com/store/aceramer/en_US/pd/productID.295337500) - this one is only 700 and again has way better specs than any of the macbook pros.


And this is only comparing the mid range of the Macbooks. After Macbook Pros the price jumps from 2 - 4 grand and the specs are STILL worse than anything you can buy on the market for that price. Apple products are overpriced and ripoffs, only apple zombies don't realize this.


Please continue downvoting me. The only reason to buy a macbook over the other brands(especially Lenovo) is brand loyalty. You are getting worse specs, with a higher price. Just so you can have that Apple Logo.

Hell you could buy a Lenovo with windows 8 and then install OSX(yes you have been able to install OSX on hardware not made/distributed by apple for years and years) on it if you truly desperately need that OS.

Hell even buying OSX on top of buying a Lenovo would still save you money and still end up with triple the specs. Apple is a rip off. Always has been, always will be. ",false,false,t1_cm5ypx0,lobe44,,0,1416321540,t5_2qhad,t3_2mm2zp,t1_cm5ylyf,-33,1425966875,0,0,cm5ypx0,Seattle,-33,,,

"The contempt for civil disobedience in this thread is appalling.  The people being upvoted in this thread are perfect examples of naive homebody know-it-alls who I doubt have spent any amount of time experiencing what actually goes on at these things other than listening to what Q13 tells them.  Thousands and thousands of people take to the streets to keep important issues in the mainstream and yet all you will see if you stay at home in the comfort of your living room is that dozen or so people who decide to throw a rock at a cop, or smash a window.  ""Thousands March In Support of Labor Movement"" does not make ratings.  ""May Day Protests Turn Violent as SPD Comes Under Fire"" definitely does make ratings and convinces those of you who are unwilling to experience it for yourselves that May Day is a gathering of left wing nut jobs.  And before you start, your anecdote about watching somebody smash a window will not convince me otherwise.  My opinions on the matter are rooted in years of first hand experience.


It sickens me how easily manipulable people are by news organizations.  During Occupy the Times, Q13, Komo and Kiro were down there everyday actively seeking out the most whack-o people they could find to interview.  They'd point and say ""Oh!  Look at that one!"" referencing a man in an odd costume, yelling at the top of his lungs, holding a sign that said something about Hitler.  They *actively* avoided people with their heads firmly planted on their shoulders because it went against the constant talking point of ""what do they want??""


It's the same with May Day.  May Day is a very culturally significant day that needs to be kept in peoples minds.  There is a reason why millions take part in these demonstrations every year.  Income inequality, unfair labor practices, union busting, and in some parts of the world mass murder, all in the name of human greed is a subject I take very seriously and am ecstatic to see so many others feeling the same way.  Sorry if it makes you late to work or if you happen to be exposed to thinking different than your own but to me it's worth it.

For instance:

And:
