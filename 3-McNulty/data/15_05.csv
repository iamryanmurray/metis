"&gt; They were also one of the manufacturers of Agent Orange, which was contaminated with dioxins and was used in Vietnam at levels more then twelve times the safe limit imposed here in the US. I highly doubt they didn't know about the dioxin contamination and I believe they also encouraged the US army to use Agent Orange at the unsafe levels in order to get the army to buy mass amounts.

First off, the biotech Monsanto company that exists today is a completely different legal entity than the chemical Monsanto during the Vietnam War era. The old chemical Monsanto purchased various biotech and seed companies, including transgenic Agracetus. Later around 2000, all but biotech business was sold off to Pharmacia and Solutia. The biotech business made the mistake of retaining the old ""Monsanto"" name. So what you have today is a 20 year biotech ag company that just happens to have the name of the old chemical producing Monsanto.

Second, Monsanto was compelled by the US Government to produce Agent Orange. The US Government specified the Agent Orange formula and applied in Vietnam. Monsanto along with other companies merely manufactured it. On top of all of this, **Monsanto is the one that discovered that the 2,4,5-T component was contaminated with a dioxin and told the US Government, which ignored this information**.

One big problem I found as a physicist and web programmer is the prevalence of autism spectrum behaviors among the men. A lot of them are profoundly socially naive but because they have high IQs, they tend to believe that they can extrapolate all answers to human behavior from the first principles somewhere in their head. As if people are like math.

It's a lot of work to work with people who are socially naive and naturally low on empathy and self-awareness. It's like having two jobs at once. 

This is what women often face in these kinds of environments. And if you're on the nerd spectrum too, as a woman, it can be just overwhelming.

The Boston Tea Party was a riot that has become a symbol for the revolution. 

Riots happened all throughout the South in the 50s and 60s in parallel to peaceful protests due to the injustice that black people faced.

Stonewall was a riot that we celebrate every year for gay pride.

Riots happen in countries around the world from Spain to Egypt to Thailand due to injustice and inequality.

The WTO riots are a part of Seattle's legacy.

The Baltimore and Ferguson riots were in the face of ongoing inequality.

This is more of a culture thing. Various scandanavian monarchs tour around the

A bit less with Finland, Denmark, and Sweden, but still a good amount. 

So, a WHOLE LOT of their cultural base is in the US. And when they go around 
and do their cultural promotion things, in return you have a whole lot of people
from the US visiting those countries in return.

Forbes article in reagrds to the second hand smoke

http://www.forbes.com/sites/danielfisher/2013/12/12/study-finds-no-link-between-secondhand-smoke-and-cancer/

Quote from the article: 
“What this study basically showed is what people kind of knew already: At low passive exposures the risk is not that great,” he said. “While that’s good news, it shouldn’t stop anyone from saying, “I don’t want to be a in a bar or any place else with someone who is smoking.”

One researcher in the article said the most important effect of indoor-smoking bans may be on smokers.

“The strongest reason to avoid passive cigarette smoke is to change societal behavior: to not live in a society where smoking is a norm,” said Dr. Jyoti Patel of Northwestern University School of Medicine.

So again the part to look at: "" 'While that’s good news, it shouldn’t stop anyone from saying, “I don’t want to be a in a bar or any place else with someone who is smoking.”

One researcher in the article said the most important effect of indoor-smoking bans may be on smokers.

So again as was stated, I am fine with indoor bans. I am fine with bans on being able to smoke in the unit I pay for. But banning smoking in a public open outdoor area is not cool. Smokers and non smokers should be able to enjoy the parks. The fact that the smoke annoys you is just the fact that the smoke annoys you.

Also if you want I can also site the 2010 SG report that states that passive exposure to smoke, less than 1-3 per day, via second hand is not truly harmful

"&gt; Dumping pesticide on my food is the problem. If you think this is dumb, go to the store, buy some roundup, and drink it. 

While I think that you and I would agree on a lot regarding sustainable food production methods, this is a canard.

Virtually anything will kill you, provided you reach a sufficient quantity.  Drinking large amounts of water in a short period of time will cause water intoxication and you will die.  If you have a pet and have taken it to the vet, oftentimes the vet will prescribe the exact same medication a doctor that treats humans would give to you; your pet receives a much smaller dose.

Whether or not pesticides are unsafe is a function of how much is ingested over time relative to how much your body can clean out.  The whole point of pesticides, be they Roundup or organic chemicals, is to poison the relatively tiny insect while the much larger mammal that eats the plant is unaffected.  Even a lengthy [article on organic pesticides from Mother Earth News](http://www.motherearthnews.com/organic-gardening/organic-pesticides-zmaz94fmzraw.aspx) includes the note that described mixtures are ""nontoxic (for you),"" but I do not think you will like the results if you drink a [bottle of Sabadilla](http://www.gardening.cornell.edu/factsheets/ecogardening/natbotan.html).",false,false,t1_crj5kmr,somenewuser,Central Area,0,1432452156,t5_2qhad,t3_3711c9,t1_crj2485,11,1433236721,0,0,crj5kmr,Seattle,11,,flair

This is indeed the justification, and the article (unfortunately) doesn't present data that let's us make a verdict on this.  The article only looks at emergency calls in the neighborhood adjacent to the housing.  **It's possible that emergency calls went up in that neighborhood, while overall calls and costs decreased across the city as a whole**.    

If this did happen (overall emergency calls going down while local-neighborhood calls go up), could the program be considered a success?

Do you sincerely believe all races are equally targeted with lethal force? What kind of ignorant agenda are you forwarding?

SPD wasn't investigated for equal harassment - they were investigated for racist profiling and excessive force. 
The rate of lethal attacks by law enforcement against blacks is [three times higher](http://www.poynter.org/news/mediawire/266133/fact-checking-claims-about-race-after-ferguson-shooting/) than that of whites, controlling for legal interventions (the proportion of confrontations with law enforcement).

Pros:

- Relatively inexpensive compared to areas just south of it

- If I didn't need a car for work I could live here without a car.

- I'm on I-5 in two minutes and home off of the off-ramp in three. 

- Feels both like a city and like I'm out of the way a little

- The lake. I can go whenever I want. No need to worry about parking or anything. If I'm going for a run I'm at the lake in a minute. 

Cons:

- Slowly creeping towards expensive (I keep waiting for my lease to be up in a couple months and them to hit me with a $$$)

- Traffic can be a little tough if I'm trying to drive out of the neighborhood

Pros

- UDistrict with all its ""downtown"" area is close enough to walk to if you want any of the things there, but it's not nearly as loud or as traffic-heavy here
- Going to be a short walk to a light rail station next year, and therefore, SeaTac and the stadiums
- It's also a short walk or bike ride to everything else I could want like the grocery store, bars, gas station, fishing spots(incl. some that salmon run by), etc
- Can largely dodge that I-5 southbound traffic black hole from Northgate to Mercer
- Having a hash bar I can walk to
- Not nearly as foggy as the west side of the city

"Man... I WISH the government would send someone to inspect the house I rent! When I first moved in i realized that 90% of the outlets were not grounded. I bought a handful of those plugs that convert your shitty outlets into shitty grounded outlets by screwing them in.

I figured, ""Hey, may as well call an electrician!"" I thought that if I got a free quote from an electrician I could take it to the landlord and offer to pay half to get truly grounds outlets. Only fair, right?

Electrician comes and is appalled by the wiring in the house. Stating it's clear that the homeowner did his own wiring and shows us (my SO and I) that most of the wiring is over 50 years old. What few outlets were grounded were done very improperly. Basically. Nothing about the electrical work in this house is up to code.

His exact words, ""This house's wiring is a hazard.""

There's several light switches where there's two of them and you have to play with each one before the one you want actually turns on that light. 

There's only one fuse box and everything is labeled ""laundry"" and the box is from 1948. When the house was built. 

What few grounded outlets actually exists at merely grounded into random pipes in the basement.

Huge portions of the wiring is channeled into what few fuses are available. Example: All electricity in the kitchen upstairs is also tied in with the bathroom(upstairs), laundry area, half the basement and one outdoor outlet. If that fuse trips then nearly half the house is powerless.

TL;DR: the house I rent is a hazard. the electrician quoted $17,000 to bring the electrical work to this house up to code. I brought this up to the landlord and was essentially laughed at. I didn't put up a fight because I pay $1,500 a month for a 3 bedroom home and feel I don't have the ""right"" to complain.

"Diversity is more than ethnicity. The situation here is that the tech industry is pretty brutal and fiercely competative. For example, Amazon takes in a lot of people in their mid-late 20s only to work them like crazy before they tire and go somewhere else. No one can stand that work pressure for more than a decade at most, and usually only a few years.

This means that many of those people work 60+ hours per week, have no kids and make a ton of money. Nothing wrong with that, good for them. But it means that they can pay a lot for a small unit, have no need for child care services, schools or any other amenity required for family units. In turn the city does not supply these, nor are there any financial incentives for the private sector to do so.

The result is very monotone city that primarily consists of offices, smaller housing units, retail and bars. This is what people mean with lack of diversity. It is not a city in which to raise your kids and have very few things of interest apart from the nature that surrounds it. Imagine Seattle without Pike Place Market or Seattle Center. There is barely anything of interest in the center of the city. When I moved here from Copenhagen, which is the same population and GDP/capita as Seattle, I was amazed at how dead the city is after office hours.

"Well, there are a few different options depending on what you consider ""reasonably priced"".

I would say [Joule](http://joulerestaurant.com/menu/dinner/) is a restaurant that's pretty unique to Seattle, but it's definitely pricier. Its sister restaurant [Revel](http://www.revelseattle.com/menu-main/) is better, but still not super cheap.


[Il Corvo](http://ilcorvopasta.com/) in Pioneer Square does incredible handmade pasta for a great price, but it's only open during weekdays at lunch.


Seattle does Vietnamese well, though ironically I haven't been to a ton of the usual suspects.

[Green Leaf](http://greenleaftaste.com/#!/home/) and [Tamarind Tree](http://www.tamarindtreerestaurant.com/index.php?page=menu) are both generally considered to be at the front of the pack.


Of course, there's always [Paseo](http://www.paseoseattle.com/index.php/menu.html), which tends to come up pretty frequently whenever people talk about ""best sandwiches in Seattle"". I don't know of anywhere else that does sandwiches like they do, which might make it worth a stop if you're just here for a few days. They went through a change of ownership recently though, and some people say that it hasn't been as good, but I hadn't been during the old ownership enough times to be able to say.

We know there are vast untapped oil reserves globally, but according to a recent study in the academic journal Nature, in order to avoid a global temperature increase of 2 degrees Celsius (what many in the scientific community argue is the tipping point for the more catastrophic effects of climate change) we cannot extract and burn 90% of these reserves, including ALL ARCTIC OIL.

"&gt; Police say drug arrests off campus this winter raised concerns about drug use so they wanted to go inside the school to see how rampant the drug trade had become.

&gt; ""(Tukwila police) approached our superintendent to do an investigation here,"" said school district spokeswoman Sara Niegowski. ""The only people in the district who knew were going to be the ones who had to give the OK, for the safety of the officers.""

So, on the allegation of drug arrests OFF CAMPUS raising concerns about drug use the police infiltrated a school with very little oversight (allegedly for officer safety) for the purpose of stinging students.

&gt; Their investigation revealed Friday that the vast majority of Foster High School students are not involved in drugs, but they did bust two students for selling Molly, powdered cocaine and marijuana. Those two students have been charged with felonies for selling drugs. An adult not affiliated with the school was also arrested for selling drugs on school property.

Key words: Vast Majority are not involved in drugs, so after months of surveying  children, the best they could grab were two students and an unaffiliated person. 

Before anyone starts patting anyone on the back over this, is anyone not a little disturbed at the idea a few clandestine officers can approach school administrators and collaborate on a scheme to spy on the children of the school on the fringe hope of finding a drug issue?  

 
Their own conclusions stated that the vast majority aren't involved, and their own justification for being there was 'drug arrests off campus' -- so, if they had intelligence that did not pertain to the school, why the several month long undercover operation?

"May Day, also known as *International Workers' Day*, is a long standing cultural/social holiday celebrating workers' rights ever since the late 1800s. The state of Washington has a very strong history with socialist workers' rights movements over that same period; anarchist and socialist groups have been very active here for a long time in Seattle, Spokane, Yakima, and Tacoma. The IWW, William ""Big Bill"" Haywood, and even Emma Goldman have strong ties to the area.

May Day in Seattle continues to evolve, as the most recent one focused on immigrant rights.

"&gt; As Dan Lyons wrote, “If you can’t make money after 10 years, what does that tell you?”

Anyone who thinks that Amazon *can't* make money is not paying attention. (Since most of the companies mentioned aren't based in Seattle, I'm focusing on the one that is.)

Amazon has been making an operating profit for a while, and shoveling that money back into investments in infrastructure, whether it's distribution centers for their retail business, or data centers for AWS. 

So yes, when you look at the final bottom line, it looks like they're not profitable. You might notice, though, that the losses are always small. They're effectively targeting a rough break-even, letting them spend as much as they can on investment that fuels growth.

As long as the growth looks impressive, shareholders will let Bezos do what he wants. Bezos enjoys entering new markets and playing new games. He's going to keep taking the cash thrown off by the profitable parts of the business and using it to keep his own job interesting. 

So what's the implication for Seattle? First off, Seattle does not have nearly as much angel investor or venture capital activity as the Bay Area does, so up front it's less likely that issues suggested by the article would affect us as much. Beyond that, do you think Amazon's retail or AWS businesses are about to implode? Do you think Microsoft's fortunes are going to change drastically in the short term? Do you think Tableau or Zillow are bubble companies? 

And suppose a bunch of startups were to go out of business. Seems to me the main effect would be that hiring of engineers will get easier for Amazon and the Bay Area companies that have opened offices here looking for talent (Google, Facebook, Salesforce, ...).

"Where can I read the agreement? Do you have a link to the text?
I'm guessing you don't have such a link, since the text of the agreement is _not available to the public_ and is in fact a closely held secret (so closely held that Senator Boxer was told she [couldn't take notes on it](https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2015/05/12/can-read-notes-life-top-democratic-senator-blasts-obamas-tpp-secrecy/) and members of Congress threatened with [criminal prosecution](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150317/05052630338/ustr-pushes-congress-to-approve-trade-deals-threatens-reps-with-criminal-prosecution-if-they-tell-public-whats-them.shtml) if they talked about its contents.)

But you either knew that, in which case you are being dishonest, or did not, in which case you are ignorant of where you speak and intellectually too lazy to do the slightest research. Your ""three facts"" are, _in fact_, counterfactual so far as those of us who have been paying attention can tell.
&gt; The text of the agreement will be made public as Congress is debating it.

Do you have a source for this, or is this just your opinion? Because Congress has _been_ debating it, albeit away from the floor, and the text is still not public. The Congress is supposed to work for us, the citizens. They can't do that well if they don't know what we think, and we can't tell them what we think without seeing the text, as you so cogently argue. We _can_ however, tell them that secret trade agreements are Not On, and we shall continue to tell them so.
&gt; It's in the best interest of the U.S. to be involved in a major trade agreement in the Pacific - to be left out of an agreement of this magnitude would be a mistake because it's going to be made with or without us.

It's only in the best interest of the US to be involved in a trade agreement if the agreement favors the US. We haven't seen the text, so we don't know if or in what way that might be the case. USTR unilaterally dragging the rest of the country into a pig-containing poke isn't in our best interest.
   
&gt; The agreement isn't being ""fast-tracked"". 

Are you accusing The Hill of making shit up, or do you just not know what you are talking about?
It's true that the argument isn't being ""fast tracked"" in that the Senate just voted against ""fast track"" authority for the agreement. In the context of the rest of your statement
&gt;It's been negotiated for several years, and it will be up for public debate for several years, even during an election year.

it's a non-sequitur. Stop trying to tell others they can't have an opinion based on your own ignorance (or dishonesty).

"GMOs cannot be copyrighted but can be patented. Copyrights last for 70-120 years where as patents expire in 20 years (the first generation Roundup Ready soy just came off patent this year). Furthermore it's just the genetically engineered trait (e.g. glyphosate resistance) that is patented. Those traits are then backcrossed into various varieties (i.e. they are not clones). Thus the entire organism is not patented, just particular trait(s).

On top of all of this, non-GMOs can and are patented, most notably hybrids (e.g. [non-GMO hybrid corn](https://www.google.com/?tbm=pts&amp;gws_rd=ssl#tbm=pts&amp;q=hybrid+corn)).

In terms of money, if a living wage is one in which I can afford rent, my utilities, food, medical, and other necessities, then my wage most certainly is not living.  Rent alone would eat up about 2/3 of what I make each month.  What I do have left over, I often spend on my students - notebooks for students in foster care, kleenex so students aren't out of the room missing content, audio books for students with learning needs, and teaching materials to create high-engagement activities that the school doesn't have enough money to fund. 

 I often work 12-18 hours a day grading, lesson planning, teaching, and working individually with my kids to bridge learning gaps and support their education.  Pair that with a rising population of high-needs students who need the additional 1 to 1 time, the threat of tying tests to teacher pay, and increasing class sizes for secondary school, and it creates a recipe for more struggling learners and and more frustrated educators.

Short answer, yes.  I've found that the quickest way to offend someone is to point out that their lifestyle is not sustainable.  I could insult a stranger to their face- call them fat and ugly- and they'd react better than if I told them I was driving an electric car to help save the planet.


By actually getting out and speaking up for what they believe in, the protestors have pointed out that the status quo needs to change.

So, instead of using money for food, you can pay inflated insurance premiums, and wait 3 weeks
after a heart attack to get treatment covered for by your plan instead of having to go to the ER!

Maybe the hippies can do something similar for the energy problem. We just replace everything 
with renewable ""green"" energy, costs for electric and fuel go up 5 times, all the poor people lose
their jobs in the economic crash, freeze or boil because they can't afford the electric, and then
slowly starve because food prices are spiking. 

But hey, at least global warming and sea level rise won't kill em. lol! 

Or we could always go with nuclear power, but that would go against the whole hippie 
no nukes agenda, and fears about Gen 1 and Gen 2 reactors. Of course, there are no 
safe Gen 3 and Gen 4 reactors, because the hippies blocked those. Resulting in more
drilling for oil, and use of coal. Both of which have been spewing Carbon 14 at the least
into the atmosphere. But since the hippies claimed victory over nuke power, who cares
that all that radioactive fly ash is being put into cinder blocks and concrete where 
people live and work. :D  ",false,false,t1_crbi9nw,AnarchyBurger101,,0,1431823145,t5_2qhad,t3_36746o,t1_crbgr7j,-14,1433104668,0,0,crbi9nw,Seattle,-14,,

*Ezelle's Fried Chicken - Southern. make sure you get the spicy &amp; dark meat ($10)  
*Szechuan Noodle Bowl - International District. Personally I love their dumplings and their green onion pancake, but I wouldn't make it my only stop ($12)  
*Paseo's - Cuban. Just the best sandwhich I have ever had. ($12) I haven't been back since ownership changed so YMMV.  
*Marination Ma Kai - Fusion Hawaiian &amp; Korean. Great view. Great Food. Great beer. ($14)  
*Salumi - Fantastic Deli near Pioneer Square ($14)  
*Little Uncle - Thai Watch out for the mice in their Pioneer Square location ($15)  
*The Wandering Goose - great southern brunch ($16)

*Sitka &amp; Spruce - American Farm. never been there for dinner, but they have a fantastic light brunch. A little on the expensive side, but go with friends and share lots of small plates ($30)

There are also a ton of other reasonably priced gastro-pub type locations &amp; they are all going to be about $25 for a good meal.  I think all of the above are better value.

Other places you should consider (but not really for meals):

"Have you guys contacted the tenants union? They are incredibly helpful, you can find them at tenantsunion.org. OP mentioned having the DPD come out and inspect the house, that's good, they lay the smack down on housing violations. In the future if you ever make an agreement like repairs in exchange for reduced rent get it in writing, in fact get EVERYTHING in writing. Save any and all emails, texts, letters etc. when dealing with your landlord, the paper trail is your friend. Certain situations like lack of power, flooding etc. are required to be fixed by the landlord at their own expense within a specific time period, if they fail to do so you have legal grounds to sue/recover rent. 

The good people at the tenants union know about all of this in way more detail than me. You guys should definitely contact them. From what you two have said it sounds like the owner of this property is in violation of the law on several counts and you guys totally have paths for recourse. I'm sorry y'all are experiencing this.

I would leave for about 20 minutes, then an hour, then longer to get her used to the idea of my leaving. She very quickly stopped barking and I didn't receive any noise complaints from neighbors. Also be aware that apartment complexes here get pretty hot in the summer. You'll want to always have a window open and/or some type of fan to keep air moving so your dogs stay cool.

"&gt; But Starbucks didn't start making good coffee.  Thousands of local business owners in the Pacific Northwest did, along with the help of millions of patrons. That small, local, coffee shop culture that thrived not only in cities like Seattle and Portland, but nearly every small town throughout the PNW, would have spread across the country like everything else...craft beer, organic produce, etc. 

But there were and are people who had never been to the PNW and, if not for Starbucks opening a store in their non-PNW town, they would never have ever stepped into a coffee shop.  And without this new market, ""coffee shop culture"" would have a tough time being financially viable.

There are surely thousands of coffee shops throughout America that owe their existence to the ground that Starbucks broke.

&gt; ... taking down every small owner and unique, local coffee shop on every other corner in its wake.

Not completely true.  I used to live in a smallish TX town that had ZERO coffee shops prior to Starbucks.  Today, it has four and another on the outskirts.  And, by the way, not every small, independent coffee shop that opens automatically has a better product than Starbucks.  As far as I can tell, to compete with Starbucks, you need: 1) Good coffee; 2) A drive-thru; 3) Long hours; 4) Don't hire assholes.  Do those things and an independent coffee shop can fare very well against Starbucks.

&gt; If this was necessary for you to realize Folgers was shit coffee, I think that says a lot about our society.

- Walkability, 25 minute walk to work
- Grocery store two blocks away
- Decent food options
- Always interesting people on Broadway (Rainbow Beard Guy!)
- Homeless people who are super chill and really funny (Merlin, who hangs out in front of QFC, who always has super clever signs and loves to chat)
- Volunteer Park
- The light rail station is finishing ahead of schedule
- Great bus routes to U-District and Downtown

**Dislikes**
- Hipsters
- Anti-tech people who love to put up posters blaming tech workers for every problem in Seattle
- Panhandlers who are super aggressive or not actually homeless (there's some people in their early 20s that hang out in front of the pharmacy at Bway &amp; Olive who claim to be homeless but I've overheard them talking about how they're going to split their panhandling money on a PS4)

"Cap Hill spent the last ten years housing Seattle's bohemian culture. Seattle has a budding Hip Hop scene largely centered on Cap Hill, as well as a thriving art scene and safe haven for gay and alternative culture.

Over the past several years, however, this reputation of being cool caught mainstream attention. As wealthy tech people move in to work for Amazon, they're willing to spend top dollar to live in a hip, cool district with an easy commute to work.

As such, everyone below a certain income level (i.e. everyone who gave Cap Hill its reputation) is getting kicked out. Not even gently pushed out, more like ""I'm selling this building in 90 days, I only legally had to give you 60, look what a nice landlord I am"" pushed out.

And there's this weird dichotomy between older residents and newer, because new residents feel sparkly clean and guilt free. They'll even complain about the price of rent they're willing to pay. I had a weird week last month where I spoke to a good friend getting kicked out of Cap Hill, a single mom who has had her rent raised on her so aggressively that she's going to have difficulty affording the move... and then a few days later attended a party with an Amazon employee joking around that he's a ""filthy gentrifier, look out!""",false,false,t1_crkemh5,LockeSteerpike,,0,1432572982,t5_2qhad,t3_375kri,t1_crk4mpy,28,1433258435,0,0,crkemh5,Seattle,28,,

"What she said:

&gt; OP CLARIFICATION So here's the deal.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; The first note (white note card) was when I visited my Grandparents on a dead end street where one side of the street is houses and the other side of the street is a chain link fence separating the street from a water treatment thing that takes up like 4 blocks. I couldn't park in the driveway of their house, or I would block my aunt being able to get in and out of the garage. So I parked on the grass/gravel area next to a long fence that went down one side of the street. I parked next to a truck that is always parked there. Like I have literally never seen that truck move. And someone left that white note on the car. Which was odd because I wasn't 'in front of' a house. I was in front of a chain link fence ACROSS THE STREET from a house. It was odd. I was parked there maybe 24 hours. 6pm-6pm the next day.

&gt; The second note (the napkin) was when I went to play D+D at a friends house on a normal housing development type area in bothell/kenmore/mill creek type area. I didn't want to block their driveway and all the street spots in front of THEIR house were taken so I parked in front of their neighbors house on the street. I left maybe a foot between the nose of my car and a driveway, and twelve-ish feet between the back of my car and the next driveway over. I was parked there about three hours 8pm-11pm.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Okay. Continue odd discussion please. I'm learning a lot about Seattle parking laws. This is fascinating.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; EDIT I referred to my car as 'ghetto' because it's a 1999 mazda 626 that hasn't gone through a car wash or a tune up in a few years. It falls a part a lot. It's a hand me down car. It looks out of place in suburbia. I realize that.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Also I'm a girl. Not that it actually matters. But there's a lot of male pronouns in reference to me going around and Stagamemnon suggested I clarify. 

What I read:

Yes my username checks out.

&gt;1) When do they use all those awesome cranes to unload the container ships and would the port authority think I was a terrorist if I went to watch one day? I've so always wanted to see those machines in action.

The cranes at the Terminals are used day and night. Sunday-Wednesdays are usually the busiest time. 
Side note: Whenever the longshoreman labor dispute is settled you will probably see them in action even more so. 

&gt;2) Do you have any damaged (yet watertight on at least 5 sides) half-size intermodal shipping containers and how feasible is purchasing one of these from a shipyard? I thought I might use one of these instead of building a shed. I know they are nearly prohibitively expensive and that I would need to hire a commercial driver + permits, etc. 

I do not have any information about purchasing used shipping containers. Sorry I can't help you there. 
I think the idea is great since my girlfriends father renovated one to use as a hunting cabin in eastern Washington.

However he was old school, and he believed the cop culture was changing, so he got out.  After 30 years being a cop he retired early to the Oregon coast.  This was a while ago, I admit, but he did not like what he saw coming.

Cops do not have a responsibility to shoot people, unless that person is a clear and immediate danger to the public.  What was this stupid kid going to do, go on a murder spree with his mighty skateboard?  Steal more beer?  Well, guess we have to shoot him.

BS.  The cop was offended, maybe frightened, and instead of de-escalating and coming back to the area with backup, he decided someone that dared threaten him needed to be put down with a bullet.  It's a bullshit concept supported by a macho element that infuses the cop culture.

"There's some interesting psychology going on here, but I think the biggest factor is that doing ""next to nothing"" wrong can still kill a cyclist.  Cyclists are basically mid-workout when you see them, so there's some chemistry at play here, too.  I suspect you'd get a similar reaction if you pulled a gun on someone lifting weights or running sprints.


Then there's self-selection.  Cycling demographics are becoming more representative of the general population, but they're still skewed towards young males.  Add to that the fact that people who are less able to deal with the stress/confrontation are more likely to quit biking and you end up with the stereotypical angry young man biking.

"Hi, person.

There is a reluctance to talk about dating and sexuality in Seattle as it really is.  This is a very tricky topic that tends to get people especially riled up.

The simple fact is that the gender roles are extremely skewed in Seattle; this isn't often talked about, and this simple fact, not the one I just discussed, but the fact that it can't be brought up at all, that fact, shows what is really going on. There isn't a very healthy cultural sexuality in the area, which is actually a problem which mixed with progressive liberalism. This is where that general malice in the air comes from. The one that comes out in incidents we sweep under the rug.

You see, women are strong leaders, in fact more capable than men, but men need to guide them in sexuality, in dating, in love. This is due to those extreme cultural norms one would associate with the rural south, but which actually still permeate Seattle. Men must lead, but women are progressive leaders. Men must lead, but women are leaders. Men must lead, but women are leaders. How can that work in a progressive philosophy, you ask? Intellectual laziness; we're not talking about mental titans.

But in this case, free trade itself isn't the problem for me, it's the complete lack of transparency during the process that makes me extremely uncomfortable. Members of congress who should have the ability to review the agreement before it becomes law have been stonewalled and denied their requests for more information. Part of the agreement is that none of the parties involved are allowed to disclose any information about the negotiations until years after its been ratified. Fast tracking the ratification is another way to deny our legislature any opportunity to evaluate if the treaty is actually beneficial for citizens, or simply gives more power and profits to the corporations that are privy to the negotiations (that our own congress members are not!) As Elizabeth Warren said, the executive is keeping these negotiations a secret because if more information was given to the public, there would likely be overwhelming opposition to the treaty.

"Seattle loves female sexually so a woman collecting as many men as she can is seen as empowering and beautiful. “Nerdy” or whatever other verbiage we want to use, to make it seem loving, and not exploitative, like what polyandry was and why the morman church had issues.

We’re too short-sighted to see this, so we’re going full steam ahead.

Seattle is accepting of polyamory insofar as it empowers womyn. Anything that does is accepted, no questions asked, no side-effects considered, no effect on others matters. It's not really a place that is accepting of different people, but female sexuality is allowed, no questions asked. It's part of liberalism/feminism, so the umbrella is up, always.

If you’re a man, you’re fucked, you’ll be swimming with landwhales and turbosluts, excuse me, empowered women who know what they want and aren’t afraid to take it (and you better excuse their behavior but they need not excuse yours). But then again, if you’re a man and polyamorous, you’re a fucking idiot whose wife understands biology better than you and is probably smarter as well.

No one talks to each other here, but they do have sex behind closed doors between the hours of six and eight on Saturday nights at an invite only club, where the wife fucks everyone in town, and the guy pretends not to care.

You’re just another cuckold.  You’ll fit in fine, the women can’t wait for you to buy them a gift while they fuck someone else.  They’re women. Fuck, man.  I'll fuck your wife for you. I'll fuck her FINE.  Bring her over. I'll spit on you and we can laugh at how pathetic you are together while I orgasm.

I love that we made this like the other kinks.  This one is so different, and you all know why. Not on a conscious level, but go eat enough acid and ask yourself what it all means.  Hehehe.

"OP CLARIFICATION
So here's the deal. 

The first note (white note card) was when I visited my Grandparents on a dead end street where one side of the street is houses and the other side of the street is a chain link fence separating the street from a water treatment thing that takes up like 4 blocks. I couldn't park in the driveway of their house, or I would block my aunt being able to get in and out of the garage. So I parked on the grass/gravel area next to a long fence that went down one side of the street. I parked next to a truck that is always parked there. Like I have literally never seen that truck move. And someone left that white note on the car. Which was odd because I wasn't 'in front of' a house. I was in front of a chain link fence ACROSS THE STREET from a house. It was odd. I was parked there maybe 24 hours. 6pm-6pm the next day.

The second note (the napkin) was when I went to play D+D at a friends house on a normal housing development type area in bothell/kenmore/mill creek type area. I didn't want to block their driveway and all the street spots in front of THEIR house were taken so I parked in front of their neighbors house on the street. I left maybe a foot between the nose of my car and a driveway, and twelve-ish feet between the back of my car and the next driveway over. I was parked there about three hours 8pm-11pm. 

Okay.
Continue odd discussion please.
I'm learning a lot about Seattle parking laws.
This is fascinating.

"The two most commonly cited cases by the anti-GMO movement are

* [Monsanto v Schmeiser](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsanto_Canada_Inc_v_Schmeiser) - Percy Schmeiser discovered what he suspected was Roundup Ready canola at the edge of his property. He purposely sprayed glyphosate, killing off his own canola, then kept the remaining plants (Roundup Ready trait) and replanted on 1000 acres. He lost the lawsuit not because of accidental contamination but because he willfully copied the patented seeds and replanted on a thousand acres.

&gt; As established in the original Federal Court trial decision, Percy Schmeiser, a canola breeder and grower in Bruno, Saskatchewan, first discovered Roundup-resistant canola in his crops in 1997. He had used Roundup herbicide to clear weeds around power poles and in ditches adjacent to a public road running beside one of his fields, and noticed that some of the canola which had been sprayed had survived. Schmeiser then performed a test by applying Roundup to an additional 3 acres (12,000 m2) to 4 acres (16,000 m2) of the same field. He found that 60% of the canola plants survived. At harvest time, Schmeiser instructed a farmhand to harvest the test field. That seed was stored separately from the rest of the harvest, and used the next year to seed approximately 1,000 acres (4 km²) of canola.

* [Bowman v Monsanto](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowman_v._Monsanto_Co.) - Vernon Hugh Bowman was a soy farmer that attempted to test and exploit patent exhaustion. He purchased soybeans from a grain elevator knowing that it most likely was Roundup Ready soy. After purchasing he confirmed the Roundup Ready trait by applying glyphosate. His claim was that he never entered into a licensing agreement with Monsanto, and thus he could do whatever he wants with the Roundup Ready seeds that he acquired through other means. He lost because patent protection protects the inventor regardless of how the seeds were acquired.

Both cases would be analogous to finding or obtaining secondhand a DVD, then making thousands of copies. The copyright protection applies regardless of how the DVD was acquired.

&gt;When the current tech bubble finally deflates, what do you think the impact is going to be on Seattle and the region? 

So no. This isn't a bubble. This is the new reality. SF might be experiencing a bubble (e.g. There are now, what 8, food delivery apps?) but it's a bubble based on social apps versus what Seattle based companies focuses on. The biggest difference is that tech companies in Seattle focus on infrastructure. Cloud computing (like Amazon AWS or Microsoft Azure) are things taking over the way large businesses handle compute. Those companies and products aren't going anywhere. In fact, I could foresee quicker adoption in cloud computing, if the economy had another down turn.

"I'm in no way defending the behavior of some of the more abhorrent members of the biking community, but I think there's a few factors. I say this as someone who bike, bus, walk, and car commutes, so has it from all perspectives.

1) As a biker, if something goes wrong, someone does something dangerous or inconsiderate, there's no ""just a scratch"". You're likely pretty badly hurt or even killed. A lot of cars don't realize that their ""next to nothing"" is someone else's bankrupting hospitalizing injury.

2) People yell at people and flip people off or mutter when driving all the time, but you either can't see or can't hear because they're in the car, it's quite noticeable when that person is on a bike.

3) Everything bikers do is noticed as ""all bikers"". I can't tell you how many cars I saw run red lights, roll through stops, cut people off, etc. But when there are 300k cars on the road, people barely notice. As a bike, I do, because THEY ALMOST KILL ME. When a bike does it, cars react like this is how ""all bikers"" act.

4) There are some things I have to do on my bike because to not do them PUTS MY LIFE IN DANGER, or, to a lesser extent, will hold up traffic/make people even angrier. These include: running a left-turn red (the only way to turn left onto either 8th or 15th in Ballard, since the left turn lights don't operate on bike weight), taking the entire lane riding down 23rd/24th into Montlake, roll through a 4 way stop when there is nobody coming in the crossing direction.

Having also biked on city streets in other cities (Mexico, Bogota, NYC) I will say that the cars were MUCH more respectful in those cities of what the needs of a biker were--they accepted that the bike needed to be on the road AND had the right to be there.

One more, re: the Ballard Bridge: I always ring my bell or call out to the pedestrian--they don't need to stop, there's plenty of room for me to pass them if they step to the side--but often they have headphones in or just don't want to move. That is the bike lane in that area, and no, you don't HAVE to let people pass, but you also don't HAVE to be an asshole, so why bother?

"My Leroy's story I re-post every time I see a Leroy's reference or a suit buying question:

Long story.

Way back in high school in the mid 1980's someone told me an urban legend about Roger Mosley (aka TC on Magnum PI &amp; had a bit part in McQ). The legend was that he was on the gameshow $25,000 pyramid. He and his partner got to the last stage where he would give clues and the partner/contestant would answer ""Things that are ____."" If the partner could guess enough right answers she would win the $25,000 prize.

Things are going swimmingly until they got to a clue and the conversation went like this:

Roger Mosley (calm): ""Purple Suit""

Contestant: ""Things that are odd?""

Roger Mosley (patient):""Purple Suit.""

Contestant: ""Things that are colorful.""

Roger Mosley (less patient): ""Purple Suit!, Purple Suit!""

Contestant: ""I don't know. Ummm... Things that men wear?""

Time is now almost out.

Roger Mosley (exasperated and almost yelling): ""Purple Suit!, Purple Suit! PURPLE SUIT!!""

Contestant: ""I don't know, I don't know. Things that are bright?""

Buzzer sounds. The contestant doesn't win. The host comes over and decides to give the contestant a couple of clues just to see if the contestant could get the answer even though the money was lost.

Host: ""A new car. A new house. A fur coat.""

Contestant: ""Things that are nice?""

Host: ""Correct.""

The host looks oddly at Roger and says: ""Purple suit?""

Roger Mosley: ""Where I come from there is nothing nicer than a purple suit.""

Fast forward about ten years. The place that I work had a very successful year. Big year end party and it is made clear to me that I have to do ""something very nice for the occasion.""

So I spend about a week trying to figure out what to do. And then into my head the answer pops: ""Well there is nothing nicer than a purple suit.""

So off I go to find a purple suit in Seattle. I try Nordstrom, The Bon, The Men's Wearhouse. Not only does no one have a purple suit, but they all look at my like I'm an idiot for asking.

A couple nights after giving up my search and knowing that all is lost, I am rolling into the BP Gas Station right next to the Space Needle at 4AM after a Saturday night of having fun. While I am gassing up my car a guy rolls up in a big Caddy. He is wearing a gray shiny shark skin suit and has three of his ""ladies"" in the car with him. He is obviously a player.

Me (Excitedly yelling like a dork at 4 in the morning): ""Oh man I love that suit!""

Player (Jazz cool): ""Thanks man.""

Me: ""You wouldn't happen to know where I could get a purple suit? I've been looking all over the city and all the shops just laugh at me when I ask them.""

Player (Still Jazz Cool): ""Oh yeah man. Go over to Lee-Roy Menswear over on Pike and 2nd.""

Me: (Way too excited by the good news): ""Oh hey thanks man. I really appreciate it.""

That next Monday I go down to Leroy's (La-Roy's) Menswear. I walk in and look at the guy behind the counter and say: 

Me (very cautiously): ""Would you happen to have a purple suit?""

Leroy (looking at me like it is a silly question. The exact same look as the other stores): ""Well of course. We have several. And you have a body like a black guy. They will fit you great.""

I then tell the story of the guy in the Caddy and the shiny sharkskin suit. Leroy says: ""Oh yeah that is Willy T. Good customer. Big player.""

The other thing I remember when trying on my grimace colored Nehru cut purple suit, was when I asked if should have purple shoes.

Leroy: ""No way. That would make you look gaudy.""


The suit was a huge hit. I was walking down the street in it and a lady slammed on her brakes, rolled down her window and yelled: ""Damn white boy! You look great!"" Without another word she drove off.

I went back and bought another one two years later. I'm still looking for that elusive shark skin dark purple suit.

My friends would invite me to their weddings with the stipulation that I could only show up if I wore one of my purple suits.

 In most of these countries, horses were *vastly* important and expensive or difficult to come by, and that went double in the Colonies.  Eating your horse was basically destroying  your ability to work your land and travel very far from your current location while simultaneously nullifying one of the largest investments of your life.  It was a last ditch effort to avoid imminent death by starvation and would leave you socially crippled and unable to farm on any meaningful scale even if you survived whatever it was that brought you to that point.  So over the centuries, treating the consumption of horse as only two steps above cannibalism (because it was) became a built-in cultural aversion to horse meat in general and here we are today.

And all of you idiots saying shit like ""we need the oil rig so you can have plastic boats"" etc, how dense are you?  This is about protesting drilling *in the Arctic*.  It is an extremely fragile ecosystem that a single spill could utterly destroy.  Do you like salmon?  Because if you do you should be out there with them, since Arctic drilling means kissing our seafood supply goodbye.  Remember the Deepwater Horizon disaster?  An underwater drilling platform malfunctioned and it spilled shit everywhere.  The whole Gulf of Mexico still hasn't recovered, and that was in the best of conditions: calm, warm water, no impediments to getting in the equipment to plug the spill.  If that happened in the Arctic, it would take much longer to stop the spill, meaning a much larger area would be affected.  And if they didn't get it fixed during the brief arctic summer, the winter storms and ice would make it impossible to go in and fix it.  Imagine a spill like in the Gulf of Mexico, but continuing to pour oil for nine months straight?  Hell, that could have an effect on the *global* ecosystem.


Drilling in the arctic is fucking stupid and it should be stopped at all costs.  There's plenty of oil in other places.  The risk of a spill isn't worth it to anyone.  Except Shell because they will make money off of it while everyone else pays the price of a disaster.

"This isn't the May Day riots. The spill up north hasn't happened yet, and it's so much easier to prevent a disaster than it is to fix one x-post.

Aside from the surface trash, there are some decent arguments to leave the Duwamish sediment undisturbed and alone.  It's a really complicated issue and unsuperfund-ifying by kayak is kinda like saying, why don't the kayakers go fix Hanford, or Gasworks park. Well I'm sure you've used some rubber kitchen gloves to wash dishes, so you must be qualified to remove contaminated soil. Removal of the contaminated soil is pretty much the only way to remedy the issue. Gasworks isn't much better, if you have ever visited there and not cleaned it up then I guess you don't have a leg to stand on as well. The surface trash, though unsightly, does not make it the superfund site, it's the soil under everything. Localized containment was the faustian bargain that someone decided a long, long time ago.

There is another technique that involves damning the river, draining it, and making the soil temperature increase and inject bacteria. This is means salmon can't pass by though. And the salmon don't linger so it doesn't hurt them.

According to the [Washington State Bar Association](http://www.wsba.org/~/media/Files/News_Events/Publications/Consumer%20Info%20Pamphlets/Landlord%20Tenant%200211.ashx), a tenancy is only created when a landlord agrees to it, so your roomie is likely not a tenant and so has no official rights to things like notice.

You can probably just invite the person to go and, if they fail to do so, boot them out as a trespasser.

Here's where it gets peculiar: if your lease *does* prohibit long-term guests (and most do for this exact reason) *and* the roomie refuses to go, your landlord is well within his or her rights to evict the lot of you for violating the lease.

"&gt; in a march where nobody else has a firearm

Nobody else open carrying is not equivalent to ""nobody else had a firearm"". Like anyone else, he doesn't know who in public is (legally or illegally) concealing a firearm. By open carrying, he's removing doubt and letting everyone including the police know up front that he's armed.

The statement he's clearly making is in support of second amendment rights, which are the same rights the protestors are actively exercising. For being polite, respectful, and exercising his own rights (including the right to open carry in WA) he was met with insults, taunts, and what most people would consider to be threatening behavior (surrounding him, blocking his path, telling him where he can and cannot walk, etc.). With racial profiling being a major part of the issue they're protesting, it's interesting to see so many protestors single him out and assume he holds beliefs contrary to their own for looking (white?) or acting (like a cop?) a way they don't approve of. They initiated a confrontation with him, needlessly escalated it, told him who's turf he was on, started barking out commands from all angles...imagine if these power-tripping assholes had badges and guns! /s

A couple quotes near the end are worth pointing out:

* *""I would have your back if you carried a gun!""* (In response to main antagonist - who said he'd be shot if he were the one open carrying)

"Oh my fucking god, dude. 

Alright guys, this *is* in fact one of my roommates and basically everything he's told you is true. I should provide a lil more info though.

I moved into this house on February 2nd after one of our other roommates reached out to me and told me about the place. He did give warning before hand that the place was messy but I was desperate at this point so I took the offer anyways. 

Messy is an understatement.

There's water damage to the kitchen ceiling, the kitchen in general is just a shit hole with ten tons of fucking muck, grime, and I don't even want to know what, there's mold in the bathroom, and when I moved in, the former tenants basically left all of their shit in the house *and* the backyard. 

The landlord did in fact promise to knock down the rent for all of us if we did repairs to the house (which we did) but that never happened. We painted the rooms, cleaned up the yard, threw out all of the former tenants' shit since they didn't come to claim it after nearly 2 months, and planted new plants. The cost of dumping everything was at least over $100 as far as I know, and the paint &amp; plants weren't exactly on discount either. To make matters worse, when we first moved in, the last tenants hadn't paid utilities in 2 months and they racked up a $400+ bill not to mention one of the windows in the breezeway was completely smashed.

OP moved in with us about a month ago and hasn't had to sign a lease yet, but the rest of us have. I asked personally for a copy but never received one. As best as I can remember, no tenant laws were really outlined except for how much we would pay each month, the month-to-month agreement, and pet deposits. 

What's infuriating to me is that the landlord had a couple thousand dollars from the last tenants' damage deposit but we never saw a dime of that. All of that money could have easily covered the repairs to the house, but we wound up pitching in to resolve everything that we could on our own dollars.

I fucking hate it here. I really do. I walk up to the house everyday and I just dread it because I know I live in a shithole. I'm trying to move out now as well into a microapartment because it's just killing my every time I look at this heap.
 
Edit since this has been said many times and this is the same response I've given every time: Our self-appointed "" property manager "" takes any and all records before we have a chance to get a copy. We as a collective whole have tried getting documents ourselves and have failed miserably. We've also tried telling him to act on our behalf but he refuses to because he's buddied up with the landlord. We're basically at a point where the only resolution we have is to move out which is what I'm doing. Due to all the violations with tenant laws, I'm just going to leave at my soonest convenience without giving notice. I have no obligation to give anymore of my time or money to these assholes so if they want to come after me, fine. I've got more than enough physical evidence to show that this place is just a health hazard waiting to collapse in on itself. 

Here's a full list of problems with the house just to recap:

- We have locks for 3 doors in the house, but only one of them has a key which we had to make copies for ourselves. None of the bedrooms have locks unless you install a chain lock which really bugs me.

- A large tree stump ruins part of the fence around the house and is most likely the reason why part of the sidewalk is uneven. How this hasn't been complained about already is beyond me. 

- Mold damage in 2 bathrooms, kitchen, &amp; basement

- One bathroom has been clogged for months &amp; is inoperable 

- Water damage to the kitchen ceiling (upstairs bathroom is located directly above the kitchen) 

- Bed bugs (I noticed this one last week after waking up and being chewed to bits) 

- Nails &amp; thumbtacks. Nails and thumbtacks ***everywhere.*** I step on one at least every couple of days. If I happen to need a tetanus shot, I *will* go to court for that

- Severely chipped paint on the stairwall &amp; in most of the bedrooms

- Debris from last tenants left in the entire house, yard, and garage

- Broken banister piece

- Completely smashed window in the breezeway

- Broken tiles in the bathroom

- Carpets are *filthy* with stains from... idk what. I don't *want* to know what. 

- Horrible draft in the upstairs bedrooms. I had a thermometer in my room and it was 45 degrees F in there one night. It still gets really chilly now and then, but it's not nearly as miserable as it was in February. 

This is all I can remember off the top of my head. I'm friends with one of the last tenants and he apparently recorded a walkthrough of the house before I moved in. Going to ask for the footage.

Not even close. Bt-expression creates its own pesticide. Roundup ready means resistant to glyphosate, an herbicide.

"State: Majority liberal, but with a libertarian streak that unfortunately has led to an unwillingness to put an income tax on even our wealthiest--- and so we have the most regressive tax structure in america and are perpetually starved for revenue to fund things the state wants to do.  Although the national republican party could probably no longer win a statewide election here, the Washington Republican party has been able to hold onto a majority in the state senate.  

The State Supreme Court has ruled the legislature must spend more on schools (this has actually happened in numerous other states, with varying results); Republican legislators see complying with this mandate as a way to cut funding from everything else in the state, while Dems see it as a challenge that can only be met with significant new tax revenue.  The legislature being divided has meant that neither plan has really been pursued, and it's unclear how the standoff will end (unless the Dems win big in 2016 elections, which being a presidential year is quite possible).

The geography of the state's politics is interesting.  There are no elected legislature Dems in any of the districts east of the mountains--- all republicans, increasingly Tea Party.  However these districts are gradually becoming more Latino.  For now that hasn't translated into a threat to the rural, old-white political power out there--- but the future endgame for progressive politics is to put a few of those districts in play once enough latinos are documented and registered to vote.

West of the mountains, you have Seattle and Tacoma which are very left-learning, and the various suburban and eastside districts around King county which are more moderate or mixed in political orientation.  

City: Very, very progressive.  More or less the most left-leaning city of it's size in the country, I think.  However, various dysfunctional aspects of the machinery of government, and the city's relationship with the state at large, prevent the city from doing various things it wants badly to do (namely, tax ourselves to build a much better transit infrastructure with significant light rail component).  

An undercurrent to city politics is the need for more housing.  Amazon is going to add many tens of thousands of jobs in the coming years (unless the stock market one day realizes it doesn't actually make money).  Ditto our various other high-tech industries.  These people will need to live somewhere.  So we really need to build greater density; but various vested interests resist that (along with a population that is skeptical more housing can keep rents down).  

Previously, all our city council people were elected 'at large', i.e. from the entire city.  This system gradually led to a bloc of council people who were, while liberal, were probably less liberal than the city itself and tended to be cautious and rather status-quo.  

However we are now moving to a District System, where most of council will be elected by smaller chunks of the city.  The opening this has provided to more grassroots candidates, plus the surprisingly strong show of support for socialist Kshama Sawant and a local movement to raise the minimum wage, has led to many career politicians scrambling to keep up with the times and position themselves as progressive champions.  Mayor Ed Murray has gamed this situation fairly well so far, and is building a political machine that one day might make him america's first openly gay Governor or Senator, if things keep going his way.

I grew up in a city, Philadelphia, that at the time was going through a tumultuous decline, and where politics were often defined by ugly racial conflict.  Seattle could not be further from that.  The city is prosperous, liberal, fairly harmonious, and (other than housing) pretty united in what it wants.  But the awkward tax structure and divided legislative politics of the state at large, have seriously hemmed Seattle in in terms of what it can get done.  

The fiasco with the tunnel is emblematic of this situation: among many bad solutions to the problem of the viaduct, the Bertha tunnel was one of the most problematic.  But, it could be arranged in such a way that it would benefit enough actors on both sides of the aisle and in in multiple regions, and so it became the sort of lowest-common-denominator plan, which now looks like it will be a gigantic bonfire for money and time.

* Seattle has the nation's most regressive tax-and-spend scheme, and the over-reliance on sales tax has been shown to lead to [declining proportional growth of state tax revenues](http://www.king5.com/story/news/local/2014/09/15/washington-sales-tax-wealth-gap/15658825/) and [public funds](http://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2024548711_taxreportxml.html) 

* S&amp;P found that [sales taxes](http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/report-ties-sales-tax-reliance-to-rising-income-inequality/) contribute to increasing inequality and declining proportional growth of state revenue 

* Washington was one of only [two states](http://www.washington.edu/news/2014/09/18/poverty-income-inequality-increase-in-washington-state/) that saw *both* inequality *and* poverty increase last year

"Thank you so much!!

We did sign a 12-month lease agreement, but horribly, I lost my copy except for the receipt of first/last/deposit. You wouldn’t believe how hard I’m kicking myself for misplacing it. 

Here are some details:

* Most of my confusion and frustration stems from the fact that this rental is a floating home (there is no method of propulsion/steering) so the laws/codes are different. 

* There was oral agreement between the landlord and myself about the construction of a bathroom, which he never accomplished. So I’ve been bathroomless for the entire lease.

* He gave me 15 days’ notice to vacate. My lease is up on June 1st, so I’m not sure if this is actually unacceptable due to the fact that it coincides with the end of our contract.

* He hasn’t responded to my inquiry of how he plans on handling the refund of my last month’s rent (I paid on move-in, and again before I got the notice to vacate)

* He stated he is planning on not renewing the lease or going month-to-month because he plans to renovate the house. I read that if a landlord plans to vacate the house due to renovations, the tenant is entitled to more notice and/or moving cost reimbursement, BUT I’m not sure how this applies when it also coincides with the end of a lease. 

Any help is much appreciated!!

There were 12 donations, for an average donation size of $641. One person made three separate donations, so there were ten total donors.

The royal families are strictly ceremonial yes, but they are not kept around simply for the sake of tradition. It is also a well-calculated business promotion from all three Scandinavian countries.

People eat up the whole fairytale story and buy into the traditions, even though everyone knows that Scandinavia is 100% democratic and have been for a long time.

"Update from OP posted below: 

&gt;OP CLARIFICATION So here's the deal.

&gt;The first note (white note card) was when I visited my Grandparents on a dead end street where one side of the street is houses and the other side of the street is a chain link fence separating the street from a water treatment thing that takes up like 4 blocks. I couldn't park in the driveway of their house, or I would block my aunt being able to get in and out of the garage. So I parked on the grass/gravel area next to a long fence that went down one side of the street. I parked next to a truck that is always parked there. Like I have literally never seen that truck move. And someone left that white note on the car. Which was odd because I wasn't 'in front of' a house. I was in front of a chain link fence ACROSS THE STREET from a house. It was odd. I was parked there maybe 24 hours. 6pm-6pm the next day.

&gt;The second note (the napkin) was when I went to play D+D at a friends house on a normal housing development type area in bothell/kenmore/mill creek type area. I didn't want to block their driveway and all the street spots in front of THEIR house were taken so I parked in front of their neighbors house on the street. I left maybe a foot between the nose of my car and a driveway, and twelve-ish feet between the back of my car and the next driveway over. I was parked there about three hours 8pm-11pm.

"Gun laws always sound reasonable when isolated. Its when you have 500 laws that it starts to become unreasonable and thats where this is taking the state. When I was on the East Coast I would have had to spend almost $1,000 and 2-3 months of waiting just to get a firearm. Not to mention the fingerprinting, biometric pictures, etc as if I was being booked as a criminal. Then once I had it there was an even more dizzying array of laws regarding keeping and using it. If you need to hire a lawyer just to legally keep and use firearms its well past constitutional protections.

The reason its unconstituional, in short, is that laws which start adding price tags to your freedoms are unconstitional. This used to be the case for voting where they would charge ""just a little money"" for your right to vote. Well, turns out having money isn't a condition to exercising your rights and laws have been created to outlaw this mentality of paying to exercise your rights in other areas. Rights belong to everyone, not just those who can afford them.

This specific law, I-594, is more of the same. Want to teach a friend to shoot who doesn't own a firearm? You'll need to pay range fees and transfer fees, every single time, for that 'privilege.' Same for loaning a firearm to someone for hunting. You'll need to go with them to the hunting area to transfer and get back your firearm. Its just more and more layers of bullshit which add cost and inconvenience in order to discourage constitionally protected rights.

"I know this could sound totally like bullshit hubris, but I've worked inside the tech industry here for 20 years, and I honestly can't conceive of a scenario where Seattle stops being in demand as a tech hub, meaning high salaried employees bidding up everything in sight.  Even if that stops, China is still packed full of their own 1%'ers all chomping at the bit to buy us out and move here, and they'll pay enough to make any local willing to sell.  Would California also be collapsing, would California money also stop bidding up Seattle valuations?

We've grown so far beyond ""local company lays people off"" as a way to demise our economy. 

Example, the 2002 ""bust"" barely lasted six months for me or my peers, and the 2008 ""bust"" only meant we got a chance to refinance or buy at reduced rates momentarily before the next boom kicked in.  Seattle has thus been booming as long as I have seen, since the early 1990s really.  When the first wave of Californians kicked off the tech boom moving here at the same time as Microsoft really went into their current form, with Windows 95 launch, at the same time as the consumer internet was born, and all that money started flowing into Seattle-based startups creating the foundations of the global internet economy.

So, unless we have Amazon die and Ali Baba not move here to replace it, unless Microsoft all closes shop at once, unless all the other internet companies employing 1,000 - 2,000 people all at above-median salaries all closes at once, unless the telco and infrastructure companies all also close at once and we lay off all the guys and gals in the Westin Building, in Tukwila, in every other data center in town... If all that happens at once and a true bust is possible; and not just a momentary hiccup brought on by one company's fortunes slipping...

Then we'd still be a target for all the wealth of the past 20+ years that wants to move here buy property here and enjoy the views.  We'd have the world's tech companies quickly want to move here at briefly deflated real estate rates, to bid on all the talent we have here to hire, at slightly reduced prices.  Unless you talk global collapse, Seattle is front and center one of the single least likely places to have a true economic bust.

Trust me, I wish some days the boom would slow.  I never chose to live among construction cranes, completely clogged and torn-up streets, endless streams of arrogant and clueless noobs, and having lost so many familiar landmarks of what was once a very nice little urban home...  I was already here, and it chose me.  

But, I'm not derpy or senile enough to think a global economic collapse ever really does happen, at least not until the super volcano lets loose.  And I realize that there's just so many factors in play now, all of them all stopping at once seems pretty unlikely.


Happy to be convinced differently - can anyone envision a realistic scenario where Seattle goes back to 1970s style bust?  Or even late 80s/very early 90s style comfortable obscurity without the rest of the world's money beating down the door to bid us out of our own homes?

I'd say to make a Seattle bust really happen we'd have to see a global pandemic or mass die offs due to food famines or a true world war or widespread global economic collapse of the monetary systems.. something along those lines.  Otherwise, there's multiple layers of global economy and socio-economic fact all pointing the world's money and people right at us.  Even global warming probably favors Cascadia more than almost everywhere else.

"It's not really about the carbon, although that is bad too. If what happened in the gulf, which BP claimed they had contingencies to fix, happens in the Arctic, it will run for years, minimum. Ecosystems will be lost forever that we only are just beginning to understand.

We cannot detect oil spills under ice. Some people have theorized acoustic detection, but the floes will disrupt the main source of the leak. Small planes are frequently the first to spot the spills and you can track the slick back to the source. There aren't any light aircraft in this area of the world. It's all satellites and high altitude aircraft. A leaking blowout preventer could quietly go completely unnoticed for years.

Shell also does not have a stellar record of rigs in the Arctic. The systematic management follys of the Kursk a few years back really aren't fixed. They changed some dates and got the permit renewed.

This has all the ingredients of a bad idea. Just like moving the Kursk to avoid paying taxes in Alaska as written in the famous NYTimes article when the tug operators said, ""bad idea bear"", operating in this area is very dangerous.

A leak here can make the superfund site you quote look like a postage stamp. 12% of the worlds remaining oil. Years when you simply cannot access an area at your discretion due to weather and shifting ice flows. When it goes wrong.. (not if), this will be our Chernobyl. Some rubber and plastic in a canoe might make people sit up and prevent a Chernobyl type disaster.

We are only just now discovering new life and science up in the Arctic.. Many of these creatures due to the cold are hundreds of years old (rockfish, some of the more basic crustrations, etc), as they have narrow feed windows and it's cold. From whales to krill to seabirds these ecosystems all depend on a complex food network that is very fragile. You can still find Valdez oil up in Alaska, the cold water retarded the degradation, and that was nothing compared to the BP spill.

"&gt; According to Freakonomics, teacher pay in the US is on par with what teachers make in most developed countries

The closest source I can find for this statement is [here](http://freakonomics.com/2014/11/27/is-americas-education-problem-really-just-a-teacher-problem-full-transcript/) (I couldn't find any mentions in the link you gave?) and while it does argue that increased teacher pay (which is not what this strike is about) is not a panacea, it very clearly says that the US has low relative pay for teachers *in the context of other careers available*, which is important because an absolute salary number is pointless to discuss.
 
&gt;GOLDSTEIN: So the median income for the American public-school teacher is about $54,000 per year. And actually if you look at the median incomes for teachers in other nations, it’s not that different. However, what economists have said about this is you can’t just look at the salary itself, you have to look at the gaps between what college-educated workers in different fields make. So for example in the United States, the difference between what an attorney makes and what a teacher makes is much larger than the difference between the typical attorney and the typical teacher in Finland or South Korea, or the typical teacher and the typical engineer, a much smaller difference in South Korea than in the United States.",false,false,t1_crep35b,jacalata,Capitol Hill,0,1432082784,t5_2qhad,t3_36iwff,t1_cren46k,10,1433159593,0,0,crep35b,Seattle,10,,flair

"Rent control means that rent doesn't go up (or only goes up slowly) as long as you stay in the same apartment. That means landlords cannot charge market rates to existing tenants. That means that whenever some fool is unlucky enough to have to leave a rent-controlled apartment, the landlord will jack its rent up as high as they can manage, in order to make up for all the money they aren't making on the other apartments, and because it is their only chance to raise the rent for however many years the next tenant decides to stay there. 

In markets with rent control, you see a pattern where people hang on to their cheap apartments basically forever, because the difference between the old years-ago rent and the current rent is so huge that it would be financial disaster to move. This means that apartments don't change over very often, so the number of available apartments is low, which means that everyone is trying to get into the same handful of apartments, which means that landlords can get away with charging enormous rents for them, because someone out there is going to be able to afford it.  What's more, when people want to move, rather than actually giving up the apartment, they will often just (illegally) sublet it to someone else, at a rate higher than their own rent. Since you're desperate to live somewhere, you'll have to consider situations like this, because there aren't enough legit apartments available for everyone. Stuck in a situation like this, your rent is almost as high as the open market, but it's split between two ""landlords"", one of whom is the person who actually owns the building and the other is the person who was just lucky enough to get in years ago when the rent was lower. (What are they doing to earn that money? Fuck-all.) You end up with two rental markets: an official market, with very high prices for a small number of apartments, and a shadow market, with slightly less high prices for a larger number of apartments, but with everything done under the table so you have no legal protection if your secret landlord decides to screw you over.  (Or maybe you get screwed over indirectly, when the building owner finds out that their ""tenant"" has sublet the place, and evicts them, meaning you.)

The other problem with this situation is that the landlord has no motivation to keep the apartment up beyond whatever the law happens to force them to do. The landlord doesn't want you to stick around, the landlord wants you to leave so they can raise the rent up to market levels. Under rent control, a long term tenant is a problem to be solved, not a valued customer. If you live in a rent-controlled building your rent may not go up, but nothing is going to get fixed or upgraded, and the landlord doesn't want to hear from you if you have a problem. 

So yes, what happens is that the controlled rent stays low, but those apartments never come up on the market, because people only leave them out of desperation. The market rates that you will actually see, if you aren't already lucky enough to have a place, will actually grow even faster than they would have in absence of rent control, because there are so few of them and all of the landlord's profit margin has to come from those apartments.

Check out Minneapolis or Detroit to see what happened once Delta took over from Northwest after a bitter price battle - they cut routes and raised prices on local flights, they quit serving many routes that Northwest had, and in general they ran the airline to meet Atlanta's goals, not the goals and needs of the upper Midwest.

Same shits going on here now.  Delta pretends to be locally concerned, that'll stop the minute they win the war, if they win the war.


As a frequent flier I find myself on American, Delta a lot as well as Alaska, and Alaska is better people hands down.  Delta basically tells you to go fuck yourself in as many ways as they can think of on domestic flights.

It protects against arbitrary arrests, and is the basis of the law regarding search warrants, stop-and-frisk, safety inspections, wiretaps, and other forms of surveillance, as well as being central to many other criminal law topics and to privacy law.

TEXT: The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.

"Eric Rachner here. By request, I'm reposting a couple of comments I made earlier, which are generally not being seen due to them being nested beneath a heavily downvoted comment. Thanks everyone for your support &amp; comments.

in re. ""programmers"" --

Tech skills are not a necessary prerequisite to effective public records research - anybody can file a request and review records - but being savvy with Google and literate with SQL is a huge leg up.

Electronic databases count as government records, and they make very juicy targets for records requests. The catch is, agencies don't come right out and tell you what data systems they operate. You sort of have to ""reverse engineer"" the agency by looking into their procurement process, obtaining Request for Proposals and Purchase Orders, etc., to see what they're buying. Then you google up the product literature from the vendors to see what kind of data they maintain.

Once you've got the databases, basic SQL skills are the key to everything. That's how we were able to quickly stack rank the officers to see which ones are most frequently investigated, and for what; as well as produce statistics about how often different types of allegations are sustained vs dismissed, etc.


=====================

In re. ""why not just post it all?"" --

The original plan was to publish all these records in bulk and let people have at 'em. That changed when we actually got into them and started seeing what that would entail. There's names, addresses, and phone numbers of witnesses and victims. There's medical histories. There's footage of people in the throes of distress, mental illness, addiction, drunkenness, and just the general indignity that comes with being arrested.

The new plan is still to publish everything, but with some kind of redaction and/or sanitization. We don't know yet how we're going to tackle the problem.

Seattle is a place where people get pissed off when others do anything seen as incorrect.

It's where people pretend to be open-minded, but don't even really understand what the phrase means, they just want to be cool. It's where people pretend to be friends, but really are just so afraid of being open, that they don't even share their feelings, because those feelings are based on judgement, and these are intelligent people. It's where fiftysomething women who never learned to love men go, so that they can commiserate with others who are the same and convince all the young women this plan is in their best action as well.

"Well, I certainly agree that it's not hypocritical to demand change even while using products of the very system you want to get rid of or reduce.  You're right, we don't really have a choice in whether we want to use petroleum products or not; they are completely, totally, unimaginably ubiquitous in modern life.  Sure, a person can say they no longer drive a car or they switched from an oil-heated home to a wood burning stove, but that's just a drop in the ocean, really.  Practically every product you buy, like your phone, produce you eat, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals....petroleum is the backbone of ALL of it.  It can't be avoided.

Where I probably start to disagree with people here is in the degree to which they attack the petroleum industry, often making wildly unrealistic claims on what should change, based largely just on principle as opposed to actual knowledge of the situation.  Dependence on oil is not going to go away.  Not in our lifetime, nor for many years after that.  We can try to minimize our use of it as much as possible by finding alternatives (electricity generation by other means like solar, nuclear, wind, as an example), but a global multi-million barrel per day demand is something that can't be mitigated, so long as we want to continue living in a society with the technology that we have now.  Which, we do.  It's unrealistic and silly to claim otherwise, I believe, and I take that as a fundamental axiom that oil will continue to be needed for years, which means exploration will continue to be necessary.  There's still an extremely large amount of proven reserves already tapped, but it's unwise to not keep looking for future sources, which is why companies like Shell and BP and ExxonMobil are still investing heavily (like, multiple billions in funding heavy.  Drilling is not cheap, often ends in failure, and requires huge capital and manpower investment.  Hence why only the largest and most successful companies can do it) in finding them.  It's not like they're just drilling all 'willy-nilly' with no concern about what it might do environmentally or economically either; that was a lesson they learned pretty well over a hundred years ago in Texas and elsewhere.  

It's crazy how irrational and vitriolic the debates over oil have been, where both sides just demonize the shit out of the other (crazy hippies vs. heartless earth-destroying corporate villains).  This subreddit of course leans suuuuuper heavily toward the 'demonize the industry' side (as if that picture of the shell rig as a death star could send any other message), which isn't surprising, but still pretty sad.  The petroleum industry, I think, has actually been responsible for a lot of pretty neat things (as well as bad), and has a history that is actually really fascinating and impressive.  But pretty much since day 1 of their existence they have been the focus of some pretty strong criticism, some of it warranted, but some of it not.  And for some reason, this debate just can't be approached without becoming very extreme, where somehow both sides just HAVE to reduce the other to some cartoonish stereotype that isn't realistic at all.

It's a strange thing, but we tend to have this pattern that even while we glorify the products of large industry (think of smartphones, the ubiquity and availability of exotic fruits and vegetables, internet infrastructure, successful startups, and yes, petroleum products), we at the same time distrust and almost hate the entities responsible for creating them (giant companies like Apple and Google, Monsanto, investment banks, Royal Dutch/Shell, BP, etc).  Isn't that bizarre?  I don't know if I would call that hypocrisy, but it's an odd disconnect.

They were at the time an affordable option for someone who wants to work in the city. Low property value and a central location, what else can a young home buyer want?

"Cuban's opinion is probably valid.  But he's talking about startups.  I'd argue the startup market could deflate for a while, and that would be useful, but that does not just wipe out Seattle's tech sector.  We're based more on gaming, on OS's, on Amazon shopping, on cloud platforms Azure, Amazon AWS, and now Google moving a big engineering campus here.. none of which really are slowing down.  A dot-com bust would help knock temporary hyper values down for a while, and impact the Bay Area a lot more than here.  Probably needed, but like in 2000 -- 2002, it damages almost none of Seattle's momentum.

I am not that familiar with Thom Hartmann, but looking up and skimming some of his stuff, he seems like someone who is more interested in pro-unionizing, anti bank rhetoric in general, who would be happy to see the global economic collapse as a payback for unions being shut out of the boom for the most part.  Specifically saying 2016 is the time we're due for a bust seems like gamesmanship on his part, and in general there are just no big reasons why 2016 other than to sell books in 2015, it seems to me.

"Motorists here will slow down for anything bigger than a beer can resting on the shoulder. 
I discovered this early in life, back when I was a tween and my friends and I had a penchant for pelting cars with water balloons from behind the massive berm of yard waste that flanked the busy highway near our houses. 

Place a huge branch or a rock in the middle of the road and you've created a traffic hazard where the cops show up and hunt you down. Place the same large object next to the road and motorists will slow down just as if as the junk was in the middle of the road.  
There was nothing more satisfying (aside from discovering troves of discarded porn, found money and snow days) than the *whump whump whump* of water balloons bursting against the cars whose drivers had stupidly slowed down because there was a branch next to the road.  
Occasionally a motorist, who had apparently forgotten the joys of childhood, would screech to a halt and boil out of his vehicle like a single furious wasp.  
Of course the poor slob would end up drenched by the second fusillade we held in reserve for exactly this type of person.  
My friends and I would flee, melting into the safety of the nearby woods then roll on the ground, crippled by laughter that was as powerful as the motorist's fury.

Anyhow, I recently experienced a massive slowdown on northbound I-5 on that entrance and exit-less straightaway that passes Boeing Field.  The source?

I hope the language from Michael Mattmiller and the Mayor isn't indicative of an ideological pro-market-solution stance that precludes a truly municipally built and administered network.

The nature of networks is such that a regulatory reset most often results in short term competition that gives way to monopoly and rent seeking.

Then as the article suggests, there are reasons why having a city-run enterprise might be desirable from a policy perspective. Namely, we can make sure a city enterprise is putting the same effort to bring fiber to low income areas that are less likely to purchase additional packages and service add-ons, as they are to bringing service to wealthier areas.

Finally, the City is going to be adding more and more ""Internet of Things"" stuff to augment and monitor the function of infrastructure. As they do, they will need to hook these things to some kind of network. We can hire an army of lawyers to try and negotiate contracts that don't result in overpaying each time we hook up a smart parking meter... or we could just build the service.

There is a public dock next to it... Walk out there. The Wizard and Northwestern tie up at Ballard Oil and Pacific Shipyards. Don't be shy. Just be nice and walk around to get a good idea of where they are.

Pro Tip #1: Go into Ballard Oil and ask to buy a shirt. Tell them you're a fan and from out of town. They most likely will just give you one for free. They did that for me, just because they appreciated me coming down and admiring the boats.

Pro Tip#2: Go to the Smoke Shop on Ballard Ave. This is THE original fishermans bar. Ton's of pictures on the wall of past vessels. Giant red crab on the wall, and a bartender, named Darlene, who served my dad when he fished out of Dutch Harbor, 30 years ago. She has some wild stories about the old Derby days.

The Northwestern and Wizard are really the only current ships, on the show, that are in Seattle currently. Time Bandit sticks to Alaska as a home port as well as the Cornelia Marie and the F/V Heroin. Sorry Saga. Wild Bill's boat is over by Fred Myer across from the Foss Maritime shipyard and office.

I suggest renting an electric Duffy boat for a few hours. You can get so close to the boats you can bang on the hull. I have done it many times.

Also, if you know your Deadliest Catch history, there are a TON of former vessels that are in Seattle currently. Go get a drink at Chinooks and walk around out on the docks. It totally allowed/legal and you can get pretty close.

You think someone has to be *overweight* to see how childish, hateful, immature, and bigoted it is to denigrate and insult people for their body types? Are you an 11 year old insecure little boy? 

If you're a grown adult and still making fun of fat people to feel better about your poor life, you have no self-worth nor self-esteem. It's quite pathetic.

"I've hiked/climbed it twice. If you like hiking, I highly recommend doing Mount St. Helens at least once. You have to get a permit, because they only allow a limited amount of people per day to summit. The first third of the hike is very typical PNW mountain hike, in the woods and meadows. The second third is above the treeline, walking on a compact path in an open boulder field from cairn to cairn. The final third is absolutely bizarre, other-worldly. You basically just scramble up the side of the volcano stepping in ash, two steps forward, one step back. Every time you put your foot in the ash, it crumbles away underneath you. When you get to the rim of the crater, and can look down inside to the steam rising off the new mini-dome, it's amazing. It's like peering into the Earth's origins. 


You don't need any mountain climbing experience, it's just a hike, where the last third is through crumbly ash. Just need the permit and basic common sense/ten essentials.

The Duck Boat is not going to be as in depth as the Underground Tour about the foundations of Seattle, but it does show some interesting things too. Especially if lake Union and houseboats interest you.  It gives you a general idea of the layout of the core of the city, and other attractions/areas that might be worth a visit. Also being that you sit in a vehicle, this will be the less strenuous activity.  Weather looks like it will be nice today, so the views from parts of the tour should be great.

I'd personally probably point you more towards the Underground Tour being that it's your last day in the area.  It's more of a focused tour, not one likely to lead to as much follow up activities.

**Ballard:**

* Volterra - GF menu, never had an issue with cross-contamination
* Bastille - GF options, haven't had an issue with cross-contamination, but have the server double-check the oil if you get frites
* Senor Moose - Highly recommended.  Dinner is almost always 100% gluten free, Lunch you just have to make sure they keep the Tortas separate.  
* Toast - Will make sandwiches using Nuflours' GF bread without cross-contamination
* Portage Bay Cafe - GF options

* Skip La Carta de Oaxaca: it has better mole, but they put flour in it and several of their other sauces.
* Veraci advertises GF pizza, but they don't do a good job of avoiding cross-contamination.  I'd skip it


**Phinney/Greenwood:**

* Razzis - GF menu, great about avoiding cross-contamination
* Ridge Pizza is just a little South on Greenwood and has better pizza - their GF pizzas are some of the best I've had - but they're a little less careful.  I haven't had any issues, but YMMV.

**Queen Anne:**

* Five Spot Cafe - GF menu, kitchen is great at handling allergies, but wait staff isn't always...make them check with the kitchen on specials and anything fried

**Fremont:**

* Blue Moon (also SLU and Capitol Hill) - mostly GF menu except for the hamburger buns.  Haven't had an issue with them since they stopped frying anything with gluten.
* Flying Apron - 100% GF, but there's basically no flavor in anything they make IMO and it's all really dry...

**Capitol Hill:**

* Nuflours - 100% gluten free
* Capitol Cider - 100% gluten free
* Lark - Do a good job of avoiding cross-contamination
* Annapurna Cafe - Just make sure they keep the naan, etc. separate.  Haven't had an issue, but YMMV...
 
**Pioneer Square:**

* Delicatus: Just ate here - they'll make any sandwich as a salad and are good about avoiding cross-contamination

**Trucks/Carts:**

* Napkin Friends - no gluten on the menu unless people have substituted bread for latkes and they keep it on a separate surface

* For the last 40 years, the American middle class has been disappearing
* 45 Million Americans living in Poverty - highest rate in Modern History of America
* More wealth inequality than at any time in our country since 1929
* 99% of all new income is going to top 1%
* 1/10th of 1% owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90%
* 14 wealthiest people in country see wealth increase $157 billion
* Productivity and Technology should allow middle class to see an increased income but incomes remain on average about -$5000 since 1999.
* Almost all new wealth concentrates in the hands of the few
* NAFTA, CAFTA and Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China are some of many reasons to explain inequality
* Many of the new jobs created are part time, low paying jobs
* 30-40 years ago, working people could maintain a middle-class life
* Since 2001, we have lost almost 60,000 factories in America
* Most High school graduates options are McDonalds / Walmart (Low wage, low health care)
* Trade agreements have depressed wages in this country
* Countries have been shedding millions of American jobs, threatening to move jobs overseas to places like China
* TPP follows previous trade agreements, forcing Americans to compete against desperate and low-wage workers around the world
* Supporters of Fast-Track claim increase American Wages and Jobs
* All previous trade agreements have been installed with grandiose claims whose factual findings show they're quite the opposite in effect
* 1993: Bill Clinton (paralleling Obama today): ""I believe NAFTA will create 1 million jobs in it's first 5 years of impact""
* 1993: Heritage Foundation: NAFTA will produce a net increase of US jobs over the next decade
* 1993: Mitch McConnell: American firms will NOT move to Mexico just for lower wages
* Economic policy institute: NAFTA has led to the loss of 680,000 jobs
* Chinese market claimed to create good paying jobs in America
* 1999 Clinton: ""In opening the economy of China the agreement will create unprecedented opportunities for American farmers, workers and companies to compete successfully in china's market. this is a 100:0 deal when it comes to the economic consequences.""
* 1999 Conservative economists at CATO: ""The silliest argument against PNTR is that Chinese imports will overwhelm US Industry. In fact, American workers are far more productive than their Chinese counter parts. PNTR would create far more export opportunities for America than the Chinese""
* The economic policy institute: PNTR led to a loss of 2.7 million American Jobs
* 2001: trade deficit with china $83 Billion -- today $342 Billion
* TPP Major supporters: Corporations (who've shutdown factories in the US) Wall St (Almost destroyed American economy), Pharmaceutical Industry (Charges US citizens highest prices in world for prescription drugs) - thinking of American Middle Class and Families.

"The root of the word atheist is a-theist, or ""not""-theist. If a theist is someone who holds a belief in a deity, an atheist is someone who does not hold a belief in a deity. For a very long time the religious majority has attempted to paint the stance of atheists as some sort of simple belief that they can easily dismiss, but the vast majority of atheists define themselves as people who lack belief in a deity. 

To understand agnosticism, you first need to understand the position of Gnosticism, which is a person who thinks that the ultimate knowledge of the existence of god is knowable. An agnostic person simply is someone who does not think that. 

So we end up with four final philosophical positions:

Agnostic atheism - You don't think it is possible to know if god exists and you hold no belief.

Agnostic theism - You don't think it is possible to know if god exists but you do believe anyway (i.e. faith based belief).

gnostic atheism - You think it is possible to know if god exists and you hold the belief that there is no deity.

gnostic theism - You think it is possible to know if god exists and you hold the belief that there is a deity.

The terms gnostic and theist are not mutually exclusive terms and they describe two different positions. And in the same manner agnostic and atheist are not mutually exclusive and they are the simple negation of the two above terms.

"Assuming an epicenter right near downtown Seattle with actual surface shaking at or near 7.0 actual magnitude, and/or shallow depth of epicenter:

In a 7.0 or greater expect a lot of damage to older buildings, especially brick that hasn't been retrofitted with bolts/ties. Also expect older multi-story wood structures to shift, slip or come down completely.

Also expect water, gas and electrical outages, including gas line fires, floods from water mains and downed power poles.

Less likely: Severe damage to modern buildings and high rises.

However, facade and glass damage is highly likely, so there may be a lot of falling glass. If you are downtown and/or in a high-rise during a major quake DO NOT run outside in a panic. You're more likely to be killed by falling debris than the building coming down.

Also, the main source of injury due to quakes is actually flying/falling debris inside a home or office. People who are quake aware don't store heavy/glass things above or near beds for a reason. They also make ""earthquake straps"" for tall or heavy furniture to keep them secured to the walls.

Look around you wherever you are right now. In a major quake (7, 8 and up) your surroundings are basically going to explode and send shit flying everywhere. There are many videos of this on YouTube now.

Look at your bedroom, kitchen or office. Now imagine it's scaled down to toy doll sizes, and imagine what happens if you pick it up and shake it back and forth violently for, oh, a whole minute. Imagine trying to ride that out. Your bed, bookshelves, tables, chairs, filing cabinets suddenly come alive and want to try to crush you, all while you can barely stand up or move because the ground is moving under your feet and totally screwing up your balance.

After a major quake you should be prepared for at least 3 days to a week's worth of food and water.

"I'm in Capitol Hill :D

**Likes -**

* I'm right at the fringe of it all so I have easy access to downtown and any bus line to any part of the city. 

* Art scene is great, plenty of galleries, events and artists in the area. Easy to meet up with folks in coffee shops and get my draw game on.

* Beer scene is great, if you want loud clubby bars there's plenty to choose from but if you're like me and like quieter more secluded divey bars there's a boatload available. Also typically good beer selection to boot. I know it's not Capitol Hill but a quick bus ride on the number 2 and there's Chuck's with an awesome selection of beer to choose from.

**Dislikes -**

* Food scene in Capitol Hill doesn't jive with my pallet.
Maybe it's my Asian background but I'm pretty snobby about my Chinese and Japanese food. Sure there's like two decent sushi places over on Broadway but if I want real legit Chinese food then I need to go to the ID. Fortunately like I mentioned already, I'm a quick walk from the bus tunnel so it's not super hard to get over to the ID for some real Chinese grub but it's still a minor inconvenience. 
Also I'm cheap and the food scene in Capitol Hill isn't that expensive but still a little pricier than I prefer. 

* Bar scene can be a drag on the weekends, there's still a few hidden gems but places I love during the week I won't go anywhere near on the weekends.

* Rent

I'd agree.

"This will sound cold and heartless, but other than hurting the persons' family and loved ones, of whom he may no longer have any, the only issue I see with jumpers is they tend to traumatize first responders or bystanders.

I recall once a couple of decades ago getting to be on the rooftop of the Westin Building for work.  This was before most of the communications gear (that's why I was up there actually) and before most of the post-9/11 security, you could just ask the building to unlock and up you went.

The rooftop railing is waist high and there's nothing, literally nothing, between you and 7th ave, 36 floors straight down.

At that point it was like this for a moment.  Here it is man, simple and instant.  How's it look.

And I literally recoiled back and had vertigo and have had few to no thoughts of wanting to take the big first step since.

The other thing to consider.  Long timers might recall that lobbyist woman from Olympia, age 29 at the time, whose name they kept out of the media in 2001.  The one that was on the railing of the Ship Canal (I-5) bridge for 2-3 hrs that morning in the summer of 2001 (literally about a month before 9/11) tying up traffic over some boyfriend issues / her fiance' cheating on her.  The one we as a city became infamous for because KISW and KNDD DJs were broadcasting suicide songs, making jokes, and callers were saying F her I wish she'd jump.  The cars honking in traffic while the bridge was shut down at her, yelling things at her from the northbound lane as she sat on the southbound railing went on for 2-3 hours.  People egging her on to jump. And then she did.

We learned a lot that day on what actually happens to someone that jumps.  What happens is not an instant death by concussion the moment you hit.  What happened to her anyway was she went over the ship canal (after ignoring police and fire attempts to talk her down off the railing for 2 hrs) .. she hit the water, rescue boat was right there, she was literally fished out in 30 seconds but ... during that time, she broke both her arms, several places in her legs.  In other words, she was now going to drown and in horrible pain unable to float or tread water.

Would-be jumpers who might have romanticized jumping need to understand this.  It's not a moment of bliss flying, one last view of the city you loved and that beat you .. then lights out to the beyond.  No.

It's terror, panic, and you can't swim and you can't breathe, and you're about to take a ""Second breath"" under water, all the while your arms and legs are significant pain from the breaks they got when you hit the water.  If you hit land your lungs are no doubt filling with blood, you cannot breathe, but you are in no way guaranteed instantaneous death.

It's anything but instant.  It's horrifying, painful, and probably (if stories of people who have survived long suicide jumps is any indicator) you regret it.  You literally die regretting your last decision in life, in searing pain, unable to breathe, fighting for life but unable to keep it.

tl;dr: The more you look into suicide by jumping, the less romantic and more horrible for the jumper it appears to me.

"It's still too early to tell a whole lot.  SeaTac, the suburb where the airport is located, raised their minimum wage to $15/hour about a year and a half ago, all at once, no phase-in period.  They're pretty small, so it's harder to see a big effect there (even though I do live there).  But MasterPark, a major employer there and one of the big players behind the anti-increase campaign, had warned that they'd have to lay off employees if the increase passed.  They've been hiring instead.

Seattle just raised their minimum from $9.32/hour to $11/hour on April 1 of this year.  [It will go up gradually](http://murray.seattle.gov/minimumwage/) and reach $15 an hour by 2017 (or 2018 for employers that also provide health-care benefits).  And that's just for larger employers (more than 500 employees)--smaller businesses get to phase in the increase even more slowly, and don't have to pay $15/hour until 2021.  So it's not quite the draconian overnight mandate that's smashing the American dream of mom-and-pop businesses, like some people would have you believe.

There was a flurry of publicity recently when *Seattle Magazine* did [a story](http://www.seattlemag.com/article/why-are-so-many-seattle-restaurants-closing-lately) on several well-known restaurants that were closing, and blamed it on the minimum wage increase.  [The conservative media](http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/03/16/seattle-learns-a-painful-minimum-wage-lesson/) picked it up and there was much [clucking](https://shiftwa.org/more-seattle-restaurants-close-doors-as-15-minimum-wage-approaches/) and [I-told-you-so-ing](http://www.nfib.com/article/bnew-seattle-restaurants-closing-their-doors-ahead-of-minimum-wage-increase-68463/).  But apparently they hadn't bothered to ask the owners of those restaurants why they were closing, and when the [*Seattle Times* did](http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/truth-needle-is-15-wage-dooming-seattle-restaurants-owners-say-no/), they all denied that the wage increase was the reason.  [A less-anecdotal analysis](http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2015/04/10/3645268/new-evidence-buries-lie-about-seattle-minimum-wage/) shows that since the increase was voted in, the rate of new restaurants opening in Seattle has held steady, and that openings continue to outpace closings.

One thing that's becoming a trend is for local restaurants to change to a no-tipping policy, and raise menu prices or add a surcharge that gets shared with employees instead.  Ivar's (a venerable local chain with three sit-down restaurants and several fast food outlets) raised all their minimum-wage restaurant employees to $15/hour right away, ahead of the requirement.  They eliminated tipping and increased menu prices 21% to pay for it. Their fast food outlets got smaller increases.  Renée Erickson's wildly popular restaurants (The Walrus and the Carpenter, The Whale Wins, and Barnacle) will no longer accept tips. In their place, the restaurants will add an 18.5% service fee to their checks, and will share that between front- and back-of-the-house employees.  Tom Douglas (whose empire includes too many restaurants for anybody to keep track) announced he was adding a 2% “wage equality surcharge” to his bills--no tipping ban, no faster-than-required wage increases, no promises to share it with employees--but he backed off really fast when he got more of a backlash than he expected.  There hasn't been a whole lot of bad press or pushback against the places that are offsetting the price increases with a no-tipping policy, and sharing at least some of what they're taking in with employees in some fashion.  A lot of people are expecting to see more restaurants doing it.

Tech skills are not a necessary prerequisite to effective public records research - anybody can file a request and review records - but being savvy with Google and literate with SQL is a *huge* leg up.

Electronic databases count as government records, and they make very juicy targets for records requests. The catch is, agencies don't come right out and tell you what data systems they operate. You sort of have to ""reverse engineer"" the agency by looking into their procurement process, obtaining Request for Proposals and Purchase Orders, etc., to see what they're buying. Then you google up the product literature from the vendors to see what kind of data they maintain.

Once you've got the databases, basic SQL skills are the key to everything. That's how we were able to quickly stack rank the officers to see which ones are most frequently investigated, and for what; as well as produce statistics about how often different types of allegations are sustained vs dismissed, etc.

It's incorrect.  It cites, for example, California Penal Code 314, which has nothing to do with urination, and requires proof of a sexual intent.

It's a bad/false source; sorry.  Thanks for the downvote though.

edit: Just looking at a couple more of the statutes... it's just a huge whiff.  They don't generally have anything to do with urination specifically, require ""lewd"" or ""indecent"" exposure (means the state would have to prove a sexual intent) and frequently require actual witnesses (so wouldn't be applicable in a ""deserted"" park as claimed).

So yes, in a small minority of states you can in fact be put on a sex offender registry for urinating in a ""deserted"" public park, but only if the state proves beyond a reasonable doubt that you were doing so because you knew/hoped people would see your dick, and that idea turned you on sexually.

"My initial instinct is that you need to hire a traffic attorney to deal with this. They will most likely get the ticket thrown out for some reason or another (most likely the officer won't show up, but if he does, they might find something wrong on the ticket). Worst case, they might use your deferral. 

Showing up to court saying that your car cannot do 74mph is not a good defense. A judge may believe that your car cannot accelerate to 70mph, but that brings into question, *can* it in certain conditions? If you accelerated to 70mph on a flat surface, then started going down a hill, your car would increase in speed. It could theoretically reach 74 in that case, and this is not hard to fathom.

You would need to gather topographical information on the area you were ticketed (i.e. to prove that there was not a descent before the spot where the officer clocked you). You also need to gather proof that your car cannot exceed 70mph on a flat surface, which would require driving out to Skagit County or Snoqualmie (where the speed limit is 70mph) and videotaping your car being unable to accelerate further. This would be a really difficult avenue to pursue in terms of time commitment, and making a clear case. 

Most likely, if the officer did clock you at 74mph, and you *truly* were not going 74mph, then there is an issue with their measurement tool (e.g. radar or pace). If you contest this yourself, you would need to understand how these tools can register inaccurate speeds, and be prepared to ask for evidence that these tools were used correctly. 

If you choose to handle this yourself, your best option is to submit a request for discovery to the court. The police department will either turn over evidence or they will not. If they do not honor it, that could be grounds for the case to be dismissed. If they do honor it, then you will get information about the specifics of your ticket that will allow you to target your evidence against it.

IANAL but this is what I've learned from dealing with a similar situation a year ago.

"Thank to the OP for starting this discussion. 

I visit the Wallingford branch frequently. It's very close quarters. When you pick up your ""books on hold"", you stand inches from the computer users and their screens. 

I dislike catching glimpses of porn video while visiting my public library. I especially dislike it when porn viewing happens near a children's space, and where children are walking. This is the case in Wallingford.

But I appreciate that public libraries guard our freedoms of speech, access to information, and privacy. I'm offended by   porn video in my line of sight. Another person might be offended if I viewed religious images on a library computer. A vegetarian could be offended if I viewed a video about cooking meat. Unlike print and audio (with headphones), video content projects into the space beyond the user. 

One factor in this discussion is the digital divide. People who can afford internet access may watch all the porn they want, privately, in their own homes. Low income and homeless people who wish to use porn -- they resort to the library computer, and rely on legal protections of access and privacy. 

Anyone who consumes porn at home is selfish to deny it to a person who can't afford internet access. 

I agree with some posters that the OP's photo violates the creepy guy's right to privacy. It might have been better to blur creepy guy's image. I've seen enough of his hair, posture, clothing, that I may recognize him in the library. If I see him, I'll avoid looking at the screen.

"Before the sawant hate parade arrives, you realize she wasn't the only council person there right? It was co-hosted by Nick Lacata. She invited all the council to be there, but only asked Lacata to cohost. The council, being butthurt about not getting to host, is trying to get back at her now. 

The ethics bit?

In the fucking lobby, Sawant supporters were asking for signatures for her re-election. After the lawsuit (innevitable) about this, they'll move outside. YES OH MY GOD THE ETHICS, SO IMMORAL. /S

Please. 

&gt; Sawant explains, was ""not that we were all hosting—because it's a political thing. If you're hosting the town hall with us, then it implies that you are in agreement with our point of view. I didn't want to put words in anyone's mouth. If you're still thinking about the measure that we are convinced of, than that's fine, but if you sit there with us, it conveys the impression that...[you] are in support of this resolution...of a renters' bill of rights...of the maximum linkage fee...these are political positions, this is not a formalistic question of who's hosting.""

Oh, and the fact that the whole rally was fine:

&gt; For the record, Sawant's town hall—a blatant political rally—is totally kosher. Ethics director Wayne Barnett tells me: ""It doesn't violate ethics code for a public official to organize or rally at city hall around something they're pushing.""


No the complaint is because her supporters were in the lobby, and not outside. Give me a fucking break. 

Except, that's also legal:

&gt; And city rules make it clear that ""members of the public may distribute literature and collect signatures"" on the first floor lobby. (However, the rules also say ""tables...are not permitted."" So, Sawant's crew may have violated that rule. Sawant says the activity was a-okayed by fleets and facilities.)

So the complaint, is because they had a table. MY GOD, THE HORROR.

"Tl;Dr: unless you are around an area where relative to you You are getting at least a pack a day in second hand smoke. You will be fine, it won't kill you. Second smoke laws and requests to ban smoking in public areas is a personal preference.

Sorry for the rant and probably will be down voted but oh well. As a smoker I am going to hop into this argument. 

So let's start with an example. Lets say you personally don't like mariachi bands. In fact the very sound of the band infuriates you so much you don't want either you or anyone else around you exposed to it. You create a law that has banned mariachi bands from playing indoors. Now some people still do enjoy listening to these bands so instead of listening to them indoors they listen to them outside 25 feet away from an entrance or in open public areas. Who are you to say that these people who have made their own choice to listen to these bands outdoors should not be allowed to? Who are you to say that all mariachi bands should be banned everywhere in the city simply because it annoys you?

That in a nutshell is my view when people complain about second hand smoke. Because let's face it, unless you are a chronic smoker or are exposed to it everyday on a level equalling a pack of cigarettes, chances are you will be fine. It is only just your disdain for someone else's choice that both era you. You know what though that is perfectly fine. I can deal with not being able to smoke in an indoor area. I can deal with the fact that I have a deck but am not allowed to smoke a cigarette on it. But to say that when I am walking or in a park I can't smoke. No that is just wrong because that is just you saying it bothers you and since it bothers you my own personal choices should be affected. 


So I will end my rant with this question. When we passed the legalization bill in 2012 did you vote for or against it? Most likely, since it passed, you voted for it. You voted yes because you believed it was someone's personal choice and people a own choices should not be restricted.

"The power in the Leavenworth area is super cheap because they get a deal for being close to the dams. Many cabin owners in the area just use electric heaters, and not even good ones, but crappy inefficient electric heaters that work about as well as opening the oven door. Seriously, it's some of the the cheapest power in the nation at a cost of 1/5th of the national average. There are a few server farms on that stretch you mention (Yahoo's, notably), and I believe the Wenatchee area representatives are always the ones pushing for tax breaks for Washington server farms in the State House.

What does that have to do with fiber to the home? Well given the proximity discount for power and Chelan County's role in hydroelectric power infrastructure, they are obviously very skilled at bureaucracy involving utilities. Second, it makes it an attractive place to live for the people who would establish and maintain these server farms. A decade ago, the push for server farms didn't work out as well as hoped, but that doesn't mean the goal was dropped. They built an expensive new tech center, rolled out the red carpet, and then blamed the 2008 recession for its lack of immediate success. They wanted and still want a growing tech industry in Wenatchee, and not just the few jobs a server farm can support. With Seattle's sky high rent prices and tech companies buying office space and building like mad, Wenatchee is making a second push for some overflow.

This would have been the kind of RV even Cousin Eddy would have looked down on.  It was an eyesore.  Where does he park it? Not in front of his house, but in front of mine.

My wife was furious.  Me, I laughed and had an endless supply of ""Shitter was full"" jokes.

After the first day, she just was angry.
On the second day, she was considering a note to the HOA, as it's presence now violated the 24 hour rule.
After the third day, she was commanding me to ""Go Talk to him and get him to move it!""
By the fourth day, she's plotting on how to get it towed.
Fifth, she wants to burn it down.
He eventually moved it, but it still showed up from time to time while he 'restored' it.

And why is my suburban minded wife so angry about the Cousin Eddy RV?  Because someone might drive by and think we owned it, or they were visiting us.

"The minimum wage in Seattle isn't quite $15/hour yet; instead, it's being implemented incrementally.  There's a lot of misinformation and fear-mongering being spread by those who are against it.  But, as someone lucky enough for this not to affect *personally*, I haven't noticed any major change in my day-to-day life.

My rent went up slightly (not nearly as bad as some of the horror stories I've read here ... been lucky in this regard also).  But my rent went up slightly every year before the minimum wage increase.  Groceries and the cost of living seem to be about the same as they were before.  Gas is a bit cheaper, but that's due to other factors.  And the few times that I've gone out to eat, prices seem about the same.

All-in-all, it hasn't been the hellish dystopian nightmare that those who were opposed said it would be.  I'm sure our resident Tea Party redditors will be along shortly to say otherwise, but it really hasn't had an earth-shattering effect for folks who make more than minimum wage.  And (hopefully) it has helped those who needed it.

If someone works 40 hours/week at a shit job, because we're all doing business with employers who employ low-wage workers, those workers morally *deserve* not to live in utter poverty.  We depend on these people each and every day.

The point isn't to vilify landowners but to vilify a system that happens to benefit them at the expense of others.
