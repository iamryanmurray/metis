"I'm all for creating dense neighborhoods for rich D-bags.  I recently had the opportunity to travel to Miami.  There is a neighborhood just south of downtown called Brickell.  It was upzoned in 1997, and since then, the population has gone from around 5,000 to almost 40,000.  If you are a wealthy finance bro, it is the place to be.  The neighborhood itself is a curiosity to me, but the people who live there are pretty insufferable.  However, the flip side of this overnight skyscraper district is that there has been very very little gentrification in Miami, even in close-in neighborhoods like Little Havana.  By allowing for tons of luxury housing to be built near downtown, Miami effectively stopped gentrification, despite the fact wealthy people continue to flood into the city.

"Yup!

From http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=183666, this experiment took place from Nov 2005 to March 2007 in Seattle.

&gt; Housing First participants had total costs of $8 175 922 in the year prior to the study, or median costs of $4066 per person per month (interquartile range [IQR], $2067-$8264). Median monthly costs decreased to $1492 (IQR, $337-$5709) and $958 (IQR, $98-$3200) after 6 and 12 months in housing, respectively. Poisson generalized estimating equation regressions using propensity score adjustments ***showed total cost rate reduction of 53% for housed participants relative to wait-list controls*** (rate ratio, 0.47; 95% confidence interval, 0.25-0.88) over the first 6 months. Total cost offsets for Housing First participants relative to controls averaged $2449 per person per month after accounting for housing program costs.

"**Helmets**

* In 2015 Pronto incurred $114,953 in helmet operating costs.
* When Pronto was first started Seattle Children's gave them $500,000 specifically for helmet capital costs. This is $500,000 that could have better been spent on buying bikes 'n shit. This led to...

**Debt service**

* Pre-launch they didn't raise enough capital to purchase all the bikes 'n shit (remember that $500,000 from Children's was required to be used on helmets), so they had to take out loans to buy those bikes 'n shit. This led to...
* Digging a $291,832 hole of debt payments in 2015. This led to...

**Bad coverage**

* With that $500,000 opportunity cost (buying helmets instead of expanding bikes/docks), helmet operating cost, and debt service costs, they were unable to expand their service area which led to a death spiral of not making enough to expand but not expanding enough to make the system more useful.
* To be fair, the initial coverage and station density sucked as well. There was shitty integration with transit, they were too far apart, and relying on a grant for the UW locations meant they were required to split the system in two, with one half waythefuck over at UW.

**Hills**

* Yes, hills.

**Shitty infrastructure**

* It can be scary as fuck to ride a bike in this city.

"Seems like you really nailed it.  He stopped harassing her.  He didn't attack you.  From just a practical perspective, all goals were met, right?

If you had taken a much more invasive approach, the guy may have started harassing you or possibly attacked you.  I think your vague, ""Boy this sure is a lovely morning"" worked perfectly, and I'm going to remember to do something similar in similar situations.

And actually, years ago, I was in a somewhat similar situation.  Wife and I were in Beijing, and we saw a man and woman arguing.  He kept trying to take her bike, and she obviously didn't want this to happen.  My wife was studying Chinese (Mandarin) at the time, so had some basic conversational skills.  The arguing was bad enough that we went up to them and prevented him from taking the bike.  He backed down when there were three people united against him, instead of just one woman that he could boss around.

But it was really fucked up, for me, since I didn't speak any Mandarin at all.  I had no idea if the guy was cooling down or what, all I could do was go on body language.  Fortunately he did back down.

&gt; I probably didn't make any friends. 

Actually, you probably *did*.  She was probably glad (later, when she calmed down) that you helped, although she was in no position to say anything to you, and was probably not in any kind of mood to thank a stranger (especially a guy, let's be honest) during the heat of the crisis.

I'm assuming you're a guy -- sorry for the bad assumption if you're not.  Sticking up for women who are being harassed by men is something we should all have the courage to do.  But it has to be for their benefit, not because we want a pat on the back.  Best thing to do is to take pride in the fact that you did something good, and don't worry about whether she appreciates it or not.",,,,0xdeadf001,Phinney Ridge,,1456253661,t5_2qhad,t3_477qzo,t3_477qzo,107,1458689505,0,0,d0awavr,Seattle,107,,flair

"I live very close to 23rd and Union. These changes have been happening for a long time, and have been a long time coming. The recent and proposed buildings are some of a few different population explosions that have been part of an upward trend. 

Parking is more difficult, and rent prices are rising. But overwhelmingly, the neighborhood is FAR safer and better than it used to be. Ten years ago it still felt sketchy. You could very easily buy crack or whores on several different corners. It felt ""off"" to wander around at night, and you'd get checked out hard with lots of eye contact to see if you were a competitor, cop or buyer. 

Twenty years ago, this place was a war zone. A no-man's land. 23rd and Madison was blatant gang territory where the cops wouldn't go without backup. 23rd and Union was the back alley of that. You didn't walk around after dark unless you were a badass. It never felt safe. You could buy guns, drugs, stolen property and whores. EVERY loiterer was part of this. All. 

Nowadays, this is a neighborhood. It feels safe. You can walk around at night. You can wait for the bus, or just hang out. You can take out a book from a Little Free Library on 22nd, or have a drink at a bar or buy food from a food truck. It's so drastically different now that it's like a completely different city in those few blocks. 

People say that gentrification sucks. Well, maybe it does; but I've seen the alternative in this hood. It's worse. If this is what gentrification looks like, then bring it on. We need more of today's CD and less of yesteryear's. It was scary and terrible here fairly recently. Now it's a place you'd want to live. A place you could raise kids.

"I have only lived on the East side for a summer but I can comment on a few things. First off it isn't that 'bad' per say, but if you want to live in the city, walk most places, maybe bus some, and rarely use your car the east side will not be fun: for a regular lifestyle you will need a car. 

Seattle is basically only accessible via choke-points: I-5 and SR99 to the south, I-5, SR522 to the North, the ferry to the west and two bridges to the east. This means that the traffic can get pretty heavy during busy times. For the most part you can't just pop into Seattle at 6: you will spend an hour doing a 20 minute trip (after 7 it tends to be pretty clear), weekends are a lot better, and traffic is mostly moderate-ish (some spots are always bad).

The flip side is you face all the issues going the other way if you live in Seattle and want to hike, MTB, ski, etc: you are looking at 1-2hrs of driving depending on time to get out. It is a bit of a pain for me to do mountain bike rides right now since I can't just decide to go do one: I need to plan it since it is 45min each way on a Sunday afternoon. You can also get a lot more space, yard, garage, driveway, for less money.

So the East side (or other burbs) aren't necessarily bad, at least depending on where you end up. It is just that they favor different things, Seattle: city life, possibly carless, minimal barriers to get food/drinks/events. Suburbs (at least some of them) provide more space, better access to the outdoors, and a slower pace.",,,,xarune,Fremont,,1456362158,t5_2qhad,t3_47du35,t1_d0clur8,12,1458720792,0,0,d0cozho,Seattle,12,,flair

"North end broker here.

Right now there is very little inventory for all the buyers.  Our group of brokers held 2 open houses this weekend, one in Ballard and one between Lake City and I5.  The Ballard listing had 150 potential buyers.  The 125th listing had 75 visitors.  We had a listing in Montlake Terrace (an investor property) which had 30 offers.   We had another Ballard listing right in that ""meaty"" part of the market at $550k that went $100K over list price... And it was not a ""special"" home.

Consider this too... Normally the Seattle market doesn't get busy until after the Super Bowl.  This year it began the first week after New Year.  With this much demand, prices will jump suddenly.  The home you want for $700K is probably more like $800K and youre buying everything 'As Is' with no contingencies.  If you thought 15% appreciation last year was good... I'm seeing way more demand and much less supply much earlier in the year.

"Some teens don't have 'experienced' drivers who are willing to help them learn to drive, or the money to be able to pay for classes in the first place, as the article states.

"I feel like the city started this problem by using NextDoor to begin with.  Any time you unleash the forces of social media, you are going to get some random element of unwanted chaos and/or least common denominator.

It is a fact people have had digital two-way anomymous communications for no longer than 40 years in some cases, and in most more likely less than 20 years.  Human brains were not designed to just spit words back and forth at each other without the limiting factor of ""what I'm willing to say face to face.""  Our evolutionary history has no frame of reference for what we all do with computers.  There's no non-verbal cues to temper peoples' words, no simple facial or body response to let someone know they're just spouting nonsense and can be safely ignored.

So we all attempt to come to grips with what that means.  Many people on facebook and elsewhere seem completely not self-aware - they'll just repeat and spout any random gibberish that someone else randomly spouted - oblivious to the fact 20 years ago they had no idea what a computer was, much less how to use it or form thoughts through it.  Oblivious to the fact if they were acting like this without digital media, they'd be basically screaming in the middle of a crowded room or outdoor gathering, and would be drawing negative attention to themselves and/or sounding like a slightly unhinged person.

Yet, in forums like NextDoor, this behavior is not only considered valid political participation, it's actually being listened to by the Mayor's office apparently as a semi-valid feedback loop.

We're even now seeing this assumption that using social media is a valid policy-making tool, and we assume everyone's abilities to use it match what would have happened had said individuals met in person and had a civil discussion.

Scary shit.  Because as you probably have figured out by now, people will say any motherfucking god damn thing that pops into their fucked up heads on line, that they'd never be willing to say in person, because in person they'd sound like a god damn idiot, someone you'd ignore from the get go, until they fixed the problem by using more civil and/or more well thought out arguments.  On social media, most of those filters are gone.  

I didn't elect officials to sit there and read social media all day.  Yet that apparently is what some of them have their staff members do.

"&gt; One city planner recently was quoted as saying their '20 year plan' for SLU was already completed in 'less than 5 years.'

&gt; This fucks everyone over who isn't 1) a top earner, or 2) brand new to the area buying the new property at the new prices.

Actually, displacement in neighborhoods is *lower* when they get more development, not higher: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/02/12/the-poor-are-better-off-when-we-build-more-housing-for-the-rich/

&gt; The issue with that is, affordability seems to come ""in the future,"" but they never say when, because the theories don't account for it.

Big cities are expensive, especially when they're undergoing an economic and population boom. Short of building massive public housing works ala Singapore (where a public 3-bed flat is ~350k USD, pretty reasonable when you consider the whole country is 3x as dense as Seattle), the best you can do is restrain the growth in prices somewhat by allowing privately created supply to meet demand.

I'm sure you seen the articles where developers are worried about ""market weakness"" (read: prices stabilizing or even going down) due to more supply coming onto the market, presumably they know their business. Furthermore, rent jungle indicates that the change in average rent from Dec. 2014 -&gt; Dec. 2015 is 0% (after adjusting for inflation), which indicates that those developers are probably right.

&gt; So we are here being gentrified out, while a steady stream of theory-quoters and financially-gaining parties all cheer. Nobody seems to give any fucks what happens to the existing small business or the existing renter.

"That tree is the safest place for the chicken outside of a securely locked coop.

On the other hand,  I've lost about a dozen chickens to raccoon attacks in the past 7 years.  Like vampires, the raccoons come out after dark.

""On Dec. 22 at about 1:45 PM a rider on a southbound bus had his iPhone snatched from his hand by another rider who was getting off the bus at the 23rd and Aloha bus stop. The victim and a witness followed the robber off the bus, and when the robber slipped and fell, the victim grabbed his left hand and asked him to return the iPhone. Instead of doing so the robber showed the victim and the witness that he had a handgun, causing them to back away. As the robber fled east on Valley, the other rider photographed him and then called 911. Shortly after the police arrived they were informed that another police unit had apprehended a suspect at 29th and Valley, and when the victim and witness were taken to that location they identified him as the robber. After the police arrested the suspect, they searched him and found the victim’s iPhone and the robber’s handgun. Shortly afterward the police learned that the robber has a concealed carry weapons permit that is valid through 2019. The police report expresses concern that the robber continues to have a valid permit because (1) he has been arrested for a strong arm robbery at 25th and Madison and (2) on 9/26/2015 he had had a handgun confiscated for public safety concerns after he passed out while intoxicated at 10th and Pine.

"Assuming that I lack empathy as a man is only slightly less disrespectful than assuming it makes me a pervert.

I appreciate the rest of your comment and would like to take it as an opportunity to flesh out my idea further.  The reason for open locker rooms is that they allow a greater flow of people than individual changing rooms would.  The downside is that for valid reasons many people are not comfortable changing around others either because they don't want to be seen naked, or because they don't want to see others naked.  My suggestion is that we give people a choice of using an open locker room that will allow them to change shower quickly without privacy or a private change room shower separated from the locker room that allows them privacy at the possible cost of convenience (more chance of a line).

I appreciate that many women may have anxiety about changing around men and don't mean to suggest they should be forced to.  What I fail to understand is why the anxiety of changing around someone of the opposite gender is more valid than the anxiety of changing around someone who is transgender assuming there is no inappropriate behavior by the other party (which could be reported and result in the person being expelled from the facilities).

"Will Seattle PD be pursuing charges against this person for knowingly receiving stolen property or are laws selectively enforced?

The law does exist for a reason. This person just gave someone $20 for stealing something. It is not a ""good deed"" to buy stolen items and try to return them.

https://www.municode.com/library/wa/seattle/codes/municipal_code?nodeId=TIT12ACRCO_SUBTITLE_ICRCO_CH12A.08OFAGPR_12A.08.090POSTPR

&gt;12A.08.090 - Possessing stolen property.

&gt;A person is guilty of possessing stolen property if he knowingly receives, retains, possesses, conceals or disposes of property knowing that it has been stolen and withholds or appropriates the same to the use of any person other than the true owner or person entitled thereto.

&gt;In any prosecution under this section, it is an affirmative defense that the actor received, retained, or disposed of stolen property with intent to restore it to the owner. 

An affirmative defence is essentially ""guilty until proven innocent."" So, the police should file it, the prosecutor should charge them, and they should need to prove in court that they never let anyone use the bike except the original owner and had no intent to do so. What were their plans if they didn't find the original owner?

Edit:

It looks like /r/seattle thinks laws should be selectively enforced.

I'll just state again that this ""tweaker"" scenario where he is selling a stolen bike for $20, what do you think happens after some idiot gives them $20? They go buy some drugs, get high for a day, and then go right back out and steal something else to sell to another idiot for $20. The only way to stop this is stop giving them $20 to steal something by telling yourself you're being a hero for trying to return property to someone. You're causing the whole epidemic of property theft!

This is why the law quoted above exists in the first place and why its an affirmative defence that you must prove in court that you wanted to return it to the owner. The odds of finding the owner of this bike is very slim. Most people don't record the serial of their bike, most people don't report minor thefts, and the odds of someone having the serial who also took the time to report it is even smaller. So when the original owner isn't found the person who knowledgeably received stolen property does what? Most often they say ""oh well, I tried to find them, guess I'll just use it myself or sell it for $100.""",,,,hv8dxh8,,,1454979864,t5_2qhad,t3_44psat,t1_czsipyf,-27,1458377255,0,0,czswcy6,Seattle,-27,,

Have an Idea of what kind of food you want to eat (Pasta, seafood, hot dogs, Asian, Italian.....) there is so much to eat that it can be overwhelming even for a Seattleite. 

Also, it looks like a lot of bussing. Good luck. It always takes longer than you think.

Day2: Do some research about where to eat near Snoqualmie Falls. There is only Salish Lodge at the falls and it's not cheap. But you can definitely grab a burger at some little town around there. Or even get stuf from Pike Place the day before and pack a lunch.

Day 3: Again a little homework on where to eat will help. At Seattle center there is the CenterHouse with a number of OK food options. Just East of there, towards downtown, you can find some food options or just North West, Lower Queen Anne, there are also some choices.

Day 4: do a little looking and find a great noodle house or Asian BBQ place to eat at in the ID

"We rented these bikes one day on a whim. They are **absolutely horrible**. Stop by one and lift the rear wheel off the ground and spin it. It quits rotating on its own in about 2 rotations.
There are also arcane rules that feel like they're meant to extract the maximum money from me through confusion. For instance even with a 24-hour rental there are significant additional charges if you have the bike out for more than 30 minutes at a time. 

The payment system is non-intuitive as well. To get a bike after the first 30 minute rental I *think* you have to reinsert your credit card, but for all I know it charged me for another day.

Finally, I had to insert the bike into 5 racks, messing with each one for several minutes, before I found one that would accept the bike upon return. It was a rainy day so that might have exacerbated the problem, but still. This should just work.

Never again.

"There are basically two types of homeless: the short term homeless who do not want to be homeless and accept help if offered to get them back on their feet, and the long term homeless who like the lifestyle and do not want to change how they live.

The vast majority of homeless are the first type.  They often have jobs, families, etc.  They may be homeless for a day or a week or a month.  They are fairly invisible because they are trying to go about their ""normal"" lives.

The long term homeless are more visible because they live outside, they beg, they stick out.  They will take money or food that let them continue their lifestyle, but they do not want to go to shelters or otherwise change how they live.  It is quite likely that many if not most of them have mental health issues.

Smack in the middle of the freeway, traffic flowing by her on the right and on the left. What godly reason does she have to be in the middle lane, traveling at THAT speed, with not a single vehicle in front of her? 

And we wonder why we have traffic tie ups. 

That very morning I drove into town early enough that.. apparently everyone else wanted to get to work too.  Cars were flowing at 65-70mph, and there really wasn't that much space between them, but you know, it works when people who know how to drive. They signal, they plan ahead, they don't brake for no reason, they exit when they want to exit. Just ONE PERSON who decides to drive at 15% slower than the flow will cause a traffic jam that won't dissipate for the better part of an hour.

"Not a stupid question and I feel I can safely answer this, as I was a heroin junkie in Seattle during most the 90's to the early 2000's.  I know you didn't ask about Seattle, but this will explain why there is so many needles on the ground.

Back when I first got into heroin, there wasn't really a needle exchange program and places weren't really cool selling syringes to just anyone.   So we reused needles a lot and shared needles was more common, even though we knew it was stupid to do.    Back then you didn't find as many needles on the ground because honestly, they were hard to come by, plus the junkie scene was really small at the time.

The needle exchange program changed everything, because by turning in our used needles, we could get brand new ones.    Even old needles you might find on the ground could be traded in for a new one.    This helped with the spread of diseases, while making it better not only for the junkies, but for the environment, because no one would just throw a rig on the ground and leave it.

Mid 90's stores started selling syringes, no questions asked.   While this was to keep people from sharing needles and keep diseases down, it had the side effect of making it so syringes were easy to get.  So easy that it was sort of pointless going to the needle exchange all the time.   Also at this time heroin prices hit rock bottom, powered cocaine was dirt cheep and grunge had taken off.   Huge influx of people starting to do IV drugs and these people didn't give a fuck about anything else.   They use and throw their shit on the ground, in the bathroom, in a door stoop, where ever they shot up at.     And since then, while I was using, dope kept getting cheaper.

"Hi there - I'm one of the guys in those boats. Most of us out there are in our late 40's/50's and we were the same kids at 27 going across the 520 and thinking the same thoughts.

The funny part is when you get to know the boating community, most of them are not from tech; most are professionals (doctors, lawyers, CPA, etc) who worked really hard in their 20's and 30's missing out on the experiences that come with being an active, vibrant part of a city - 12 hour med shifts, all-nighters in your 20's in a big 4 accounting firm, etc. all means less experiences in living in the early part of their lives and when they hit 40, most of them are making up for lost time.

My point is that the feelings you are feeling is the root of drive and grit. When I was 24, I was 60k in debt, a single dad with two kids (3 and 20 months old) and terrified. I thought the world was full of successful people and I was a failure.

However, the desire to protect and care for my boys and to get a better life for all of us led to me throwing myself into the hardest jobs I could find, reading everything about my industry and how it worked, etc. I took the problems others were scared of and pushed hard and it worked.

The cost? I had no 20's. My early 30's were a blur of kids and long hours. Was it worth it? Depends on your value system.

"&gt; My 3-bed, 2-bath house costs less than my 1-bed, 1-bath apartment did. And I own it. It's totally okay that others are comfortable in tiny apartments, condos, townhouses, or houses with a long commute...

At the risk of sounding like I'm arguing, this is one of the stances that makes cities rocket into unaffordable territory.  Lots of people--including people I know--say the words you just did but don't seem to actually want them.  When the decision time comes, virtually everyone I know or read about defaults to single-family-house-with-yard-and-one-more-bedroom-than-the-number-of-occupants.  Townhouse with its own grass?  ""Eww, shared wall.""  Condo with a courtyard?  ""Eww, stairs and shared yard.""  Apartment with rooftop deck?  ""Eww, paying someone else's mortgage.""  Or the catch-all of ""I can't raise my kid like that.""  But urban areas don't have the land to sustain everyone having a 3BR/2BA with a picket fence and a 2-car garage.  And since the only political push to build the other, more dense forms of housing comes from people looking ahead to those who might arrive next, well...

"I'm struggling with the best way to help you. It seems to me that your problem is that you don't seem to understand the culture of the area you're in. I've lived in Washington my entire life...I don't think anywhere in Washington is really extroverted or super friendly. I don't really think that's a thing in the PNW. Part of that is just the historical nature of the area. It was settled by people who were willing to leave the entire rest of civilization (often including family and friends) to come out here and live in isolation on the edge of the nation. Many of those people are people who thought of going to Alaska, or did go, and came back as far as Washington because they didn't want to go back to where they came from. Isolationism and introversion is part of the PNW identity. And most people who live here, like it that way. And they don't like people who come here and imply that there's something wrong with how things are.

Here's a sort of primer on how PNW mindset works:

* No one cares if you like it here.
* If you don't like it - leave.
* When people complain about not making friends we don't know what to do with that because most of us don't care.

"People aren't recognizing the deeper issues.  Seattleites and Washingtonians in general should be able to reach consensus, bordering on total unanimity, that legalizing indecent exposure to children is objectively wrong.  Our failure to uphold such basic standards really signifies a deterioration in moral reasoning.

The YMCA and other misguided organizations are basically prioritizing the subjective feelings of a confused person over the privacy, comfort, and physical safety of an entire changing room full of women and their vulnerable young daughters.  There is a simple truth that should remain unchallenged, and not subject to fringe deconstructionist ideology:  if you do not possess the sacred ability to bring a child into this world through your body, then you are not a woman.  It is not a matter of opinion or feeling.  And by the way, real feminists would have agreed just 10 years ago.  Now, strangely, you are just ''intolerant'' if you think men can't give birth.

But it is difficult to hold an honest conversation when one side is beginning from a position of dishonesty.  I've noticed these gender activists tend to rely on the same four words in describing their political and social end-states:  ''All we're asking for is tolerance''.  ''We just want to be accepted.''  ''This is really just about feeling respected.''  ''We're simply asking for support.''  It is always the same glitter -- tolerance, acceptance, respect, support, sensitivity, open-mindedness, celebration, and on, and on.  But any person of basic intelligence recognizes that what they're actually demanding.... is participation.

A man is named Jason, but *you* *will* call him Jessica.  He is obviously a him, but *you* *will* call him ''her''.  He belongs in the men's room, but now *you* *will* let him into your restroom.  And your locker room.  People need to understand that the transgender person's identity is fragile because it is imaginary, and requires continual reinforcement through the forced participation of others.   In practical terms, this is a form of social coercion.  And it is affecting innocent vulnerable people.",,,,maxrain,,,1455703132,t5_2qhad,t3_466lth,t3_466lth,-11,1458553004,1,0,d031h9j,Seattle,-11,,

"While stories like this are often repeated and give the impression they happen with some degree of frequency, home invasion robberies are actually quite rare in Seattle. Some of that is because there’s a bit of confusion around the term “home invasion”

This case in particular is actually what's referred to as an ""occupied burglary,"" meaning a burglary where someone was home at the time of the break-in. It can certainly be a frightening experience for the homeowner/resident, but it's different from a home invasion (technically ""home invasion robbery"" in a few ways. A robbery involves someone using force, or the threat of force, to take items from another person. Detectives also often find that home invasion robberies are typically very targeted, and many, though not all, have some connection to narcotics dealing.

Burglaries are often crimes of opportunity, and many burglars specifically commit crimes in the middle of the day when they believe the chances of encountering another person in a home are much lower. TL;DR: burglars try to avoid potential contact/conflict while home invasion robbers may plan for it. Doesn't lessen the impact on the victim, especially in the case ref'd in the post, but they are different crimes, often with different motivations, and it can be important to draw the distinction when discussing crime in our city.

"I reserved one that somebody parked in their garage, on an alley, with the door down.

"It's not working in Seattle because a) Seattle doesn't have the infrastructure to support grab and go cycling and b) it's hilly as fuck and most people are weak. Seriously, you can't just grab a bike and go shopping. Most roads don't have a dedicated bike lane and most businesses don't have bike racks. There's not a lot of places in Seattle that you can't just walk to. It's a very foot-friendly city as is. Most people won't even consider a bike when they run out the door. The second problem is that people underestimate the strength and fitness required to bike up even the shallowest of hills in Seattle let alone the monstrous ones.

"That's tough. All three national parks we have in Washington are great.

Part of it depends on where you are coming from.  The Rockies? Midwest? East Coast? The South? You probably don't want to visit something similar to what you have from home.

Olympic is probably the most unique of the three, and has beaches, temperate rain forests, and amazing mountains.

Rainier is incredible, a massive mountain that just towers, with excellent hiking and alpine meadows.

Since you are coming the first week of May, you should know that we are slightly above average for the snowpack in the mountains this year, which means some of the best trails likely won't be accessible.

For that reason, I'd recommend Olympic, for the variety of experiences there, and for the fact you won't be as limited in what you can visit in early May.  Maybe take the ferry there too.

"You watch the video released and the guy was surrendering. He was dropping down behind his door with his hands up before the cops started firing. He could have had a gun, but it's impossible to tell from that angle.

Furthermore, what went wrong with this person started over 20 years ago. He was born into a system and culture that is designed to feed people into the prison industrial complex. He spend over two decades in jail for a murder he was cleared of. He had a bunch of other charges/convictions as well. There's a good chance he returned to crime, because there was simply no one who would hire him. 

Everything about what led him to this point comes from a system that has been keeling the poor and lower class in a nation where their children stay poor and in a lower class. It feeds the prison system. It feels the police system. 

There's a good chance the police just got jumpy and killed a guy, like they usually do. He may have also decided he wasn't going back to jail and tried to fight. In some ways, I can't blame him.

Whenever Seattle gets proper rain (on the order of inches per hour, not mm per hour), everything floods.  The roads and bridges simply aren't built for this type of rain - the crown is rather flat compared to midwest roads.

"I'd have to disagree a bit. The insane price rises of rentals coupled with impossibly high price and competitiveness of real estate in the area means that many people, including myself, have to choose between (sometimes rather humble) housing desires and what they cam actually afford. All I really wanted was a small, modest house with enough of a yard to have a garden and a dog or two. By my mid twenties it was clear I wasn't going to get that, even in a not-hot neighborhood, without settling for a huge fixer upper (requiring skills/money I don't yet have) or moving away. Sure, I could have gotten a FHA 203k loan with like 3.5% down to buy and renovate, but that can't compete with 20% down or cash, and who necessarily has 20% down in their late 20's on a 300-350k starter home? Also on the median Seattle income that's simply not affordable, and if I'm guessing low prices correctly, that's about as low as it gets in or close to the city. If you're fortunate enough to work in a high-paying industry you can swing it, but what about the folks that will never make very much, even with higher ed under their belts? Teachers, non-profit workers, some healthcare, etc.

I left, moved far east. My 3-bed, 2-bath house costs less than my 1-bed, 1-bath apartment did. And I own it. It's totally okay that others are comfortable in tiny apartments, condos, townhouses, or houses with a long commute, but many of my friends are having the same nervous jitters as they leave the neighborhoods they loved for cheaper areas, and are now even getting priced out of those.

This sort of bouncing-out of anyone at or below median income totally shapes culture and not always for the better. Gentrification can do amazing things for a down-on-its-luck neighborhood but it comes with a hefty price tag. The weirdos and salt-of-the-earth folks who helped make Seattle what it is often can't afford the city anymore. What is replacing it? In what ways are the new facets of Seattle culture positive or negative?

"Hey- I'm actually a Psychiatric Nurse Practitioner in the Seattle area (Northgate). Hopefully I can help with a few of your questions.

The big names in insurance in this area are Premera, Regence, First Choice, and Group Health. Nearly every provider takes the first three, and Group Health is a local ""managed care"" plan- meaning you use Group Health specific providers/locations. That being said, independent providers (like myself) can be credentialed and take Group Health clients.

As you've found out, Medicaid plans can be difficult. Medicaid psychiatric providers are often overwhelmed with the demand in this area. That being said, here are some resources I'd recommend. The first is Valley Cities- http://www.valleycities.org/. They have a bigger presence on the south end but they're working on expanding up north. The other place I would check is Sound Mental Health- http://www.smh.org/psychological-psychiatric/ 

From what I understand, you could technically see someone out of pocket as a ""private pay"" client, but I do not think Medicaid would then pay for your prescriptions. So you would then be private pay for both the visits and your prescriptions. Depending on what medication you take, that may not be much of an issue.

I'd also be happy give you my info if you send me a PM. I don't take Medicaid but we could talk about private pay or if you change insurances. ",,,,pmhnpthrowaway,,,1454641990,t5_2qhad,t3_448s21,t3_448s21,26,1458299551,0,0,czoeiiy,Seattle,26,,
"**tl;dr: homelessness is complicated**  
It's pretty incredible to me that we are all still scratching our heads about this in 2016. Homelessness has been an issue in our society for hundreds of years.  
To whitewash it by saying that the homeless are ""rejecting"" help offered is a serious oversimplification. The two coherent folks interviewed were a man having issues with his Social Security and a young woman who preferred her own space to shared housing.  
In the former scenario, the man in question is having difficulty navigating government assistance. It's not that he isn't getting some form of help, it's that the process is seriously screwed up. If he can't get SSI while applying for work, that's a serious systemic issue. If he's just un or under-informed, he's not rejecting assistance, the assistance he's seeking is not effective.  
In the latter case, the girl could be just picky about privacy, but what are the conditions in the shared housing she's referring to? I don't know. Are they safe? Sanitary? Probably better than the street, but I am not in a position to make that determination.  
The problem with homelessness is that it's a symptom of a variety of causes, and each of those causes requires a solution of which housing is but one part. Addiction, mental illness, lack of education, disability, poverty, healthcare. We keep looking for simple solutions to a problem that is just not simple.  
There always going to be a few who refuse help or even defraud the system, but we cannot use that as an excuse to avoid providing holistic support to every other person who could legitimately benefit from it.  
If we orient our society around the fear of being defrauded, we will continually harm large numbers of genuinely motivated, capable, contributing humans to convince ourselves we are preventing being taken advantage of, when in reality the scumbags have already circumvented our efforts at protection leaving the truly needy to suffer under increasingly draconian rules.  
Arrest is not a deterrent to homelessness. Incarceration in many ways is an upgrade.  
*Beggars can't be choosers*...why? Aren't they already choosing to use the system in whichever way is most advantageous to them at the moment? Our goal as persons not suffering from homeless, who have some capacity to help should be determining how to incentivize and streamline the path to self-sufficiency, or -in the case of those who cannot care for themselves- a path to programs and institutions who can.  
I don't have the answers either, but I think the idea of meeting the homeless where they are is a significant beginning. If we can walk *with* them on their journey to independence rather than handing them a pamphlet or bribing them into a service they don't want, I think we can see lasting results while also making it easier to identify and deal with the chronic offenders who are either unwilling or unable to participate.

It's a dude being a public nuisance, not a life-or-death situation. Nobody is expecting you to have a heart-to-heart with a junkie, but there's a reasonable expectation that you don't escalate a non-violent interaction into a violent interaction just because the option exists for you.

Now that I am in Manhattan daily and seeing the level of density necessary to ACTUALLY support transit(and we still barely support it in NYC) it makes me laugh to see Seattle believe that you can go carless in even the densest portions of the city.

  But to tell everybody that the right thing for them to do is stop supporting roads, and instead ride a bike to a train station to wait for a ""train"" that takes 40 minutes to go 15 miles to connect to a ""rapid ride"" bus that runs every 30 minutes?

"My mother-in-law and 2 of her friends came to visit last September. They are all in their sixties and all travel very often both internationally and domestically. They have done bike share programs in other cities and wanted to try Pronto. I had told them before they got here that they might think differently when they see Seattle and sure enough their major concerns were hills and traffic. They felt ""not safe"" anywhere they would have been able to pick up a bike and anywhere they wanted to go, i.e. getting one in Capitol Hill where they were staying and riding to PSQ where they wanted to go have lunch. Are there ways they could have done it? Sure, but the issue comes down to perception and people visiting a city aren't going to want to take the time and energy to figure out the best way to go when they can get an Uber for 3 people cheaper and get there faster.

"This comes up at least monthly here on here and also on most of the Seattle-related forums and Facebook groups out there. 

Short version as I've always read it, boiled down: 

Market stores/shops/restaurants/vendors have little to no storage in many cases because of the age of the facility. They get a lot of deliveries over time. There are hundreds of them, sometimes getting deliveries during the day from hundreds of other vendors. There's no way for closing off the street and making it work to track them all. Additionally, all those lone wolf vendors all over? Crafts and stuff? Their cars and vans are their storage. They need to get in between 7-9am, set up, and tear down by 5p-6pm typically daily. That takes cars. Also, a LOT of local restaurants apparently come by the Market to top off, I've heard, but I don't know for sure. 

Basically, that's it. There's constantly a ton of commerce there that's serviced here. It's a working space as much as it is a tourist place. We *could* close it off, but that would have a net negative impact on all the workers and small businesses there, and it's unreasonable to expect them to absorb costs here for extra labor/delivery time. 

There's also NO room on Western or 1st for the volume of delivery people. UPS and Fed Ex alone some times would shut down those streets if we closed them off. Last, remember that's it's not just the obvious shops you see along the main drag, and those vendors. There are shops down for multiple levels, up for a couple, up and down Post Alley for blocks on end, and it just goes on and on. There's literally hundreds of small businesses and (I've heard) up to 1,000 jobs any given day in the Market. Most of them entirely, deeply working class. Then you have some businesses that also push *out* freight and commerce, especially Beechers and Pike Place Brewery (I think there's one other, but I'm blanking on whom). 

The city isn't going to screw all of them just to make it more walkable. While that would be certainly nice, if would push out a number of the small businesses and vendors that are the cornerstone of the charm of the Market. It would blow up the Market to possibly fix it. Not worth it. 

Anyway, that's a summary as I've learned over like fifteen years since I've first heard people ask for that drag to be closed. I think it got pushed in the 80s once or twice too.

You'll do what you want to do, but I'd advise against carrying weaponry, whether it be with a CCL, or a blade, or anything else.  The odds of it resulting in your own injury or being hauled up for assault or manslaughter charges are much higher than the odds that having a weapon will protect you from a violent criminal.
  
The best thing to do is ignore the person, and continue to walk briskly to your destination.  FYI there is specific nomenclature, depending on the drugs that the person is used on: ""junkie"" tends to refer to heroin users, who tend to be p. out of it when they're actually high.  ""Tweakers"" are the folks on uppers, usually meth addicts, sounds like your new friend might have been one of them.  They're more likely to shout or make strange noises, zigzag through traffic or scare passerbys on a lark.  They'll lose interest pretty quickly though, especially if your reactions aren't entertaining/encouraging to them.
  
Mostly, and this is the toughest part, just remember that they're regular people, just like us.

"&gt;in 2003 the initial Seattle-Tukwila route won $500 million despite open criticism from some House conservatives, who said that light rail won’t reduce traffic congestion.

I can't think of any light rail projects here that reduced traffic congestion, so maybe the criticisms were right but light rail is still useful.

Public transit advocates love to say ""building more lanes doesn't help traffic"" with similar bravado (and, pushed to the absurd, if someone made 405 15 lanes in both directions with similarly beefed up on/off ramps it's ridiculous to argue traffic wouldn't be lighter in that section).",,,,ChefJoe98136,West Seattle,,1455080872,t5_2qhad,t3_4511ee,t3_4511ee,-23,1458403928,0,0,czufwtx,Seattle,-23,,flair

We started out in the suburbs in our early twenties and made the commute from Snohomish to King every day for three years. The commute was 45 minutes - 90 minutes depending on traffic, each way. Now that we're moving into our late twenties our patience for spending two to three hours a day on the bus came to an end. We moved into a Seattle neighborhood and now spend more on rent but also more time at home.

"So I'm new here, just under 6 months. The cloud cover and rain doesn't bother me at all. When it rains it's usually a drizzle or mist for half a day and then it clears, or there's an hour of showers and then something changes. What's fun about the clouds is that you can have shower hour in one neighborhood, look a few miles over and have a huge black wall of clouds, look the other way and have the sun peeking through big puffy white clouds, look up and have wispy cirrus clouds up high. The days are short and often grey, but it's a very dynamic grey. There's always something going on in the sky here. Coming from Chicago I feel like when it's grey there, it's just a low grey blanket over the sky with no changes or anything interesting to look at.

"I'm not sure what corners of the country you've lived in but Seattle has some of the best road design and dumbest drivers. I've lived in Seattle last summer for 4 months and I currently live in Boston (also lived in DC and Chicago). You want to see shit road design- look at i95/128 on the north shore of ma. The onramps are less than 100ft and then you have to go into a 75 mph lane. I'll post street view links once I get to my computer.

Seattle drivers are too cautious and slow. They do not understand keep right unless you are passing. Additionally, they have a tendency to go about 45-50 on major highways when the road is actually moving. I don't know why, but the drivers in Seattle are hilariously bad - don't blame your 3/4 of a mile on ramps on 405/167 merge in renton or proper signage. 

You don't know how good and safe your roads are until you lived in Boston or NYC. I willing to bet most people who lived in those cities will agree. The saving grace there is public transit. 


EDIT: links to actual shit road design. Saddest thing is, this is far from the exception. Most highways in the Northeast are like this.

In another instance, officers found him intoxicated and sleeping on a bench, where he had dropped his gun. SPD held the gun for safekeeping, but he requested to have it returned it through the proper channels and the department was obliged to do so.

We seized his gun again in the December 22nd incident, he remains in the King County Jail and detectives are investigating.",,,,Seattle_PD,Seattle Police Dept.,,1454379287,t5_2qhad,t3_43r5xp,t3_43r5xp,78,1458231985,0,0,czkhkix,Seattle,78,,flair verified

"So for those not familiar, this same exact situation has played out in other encampments managed by this individual Scott Morrow where entirely different groups of houseless residents have all come to the conclusion that they cannot work with him and would like him not involved with the encampments. Seriously, just a cursory Google of his name will reveal a clear pattern. This exact situation was playing itself out over at the Union st encampment a year ago.


Some of the things Scott has done in the past is hand out 7-day encampment bans to disabled residents who declined to go sleep in front of some person's house in protest, permanently bar dissidents from ALL city-sanctioned encampments (since he is essentially running them all), and cancel a free de-escalation training for residents of the Dearborn encampment.

These people at Dearborn have voted twice now to keep him out of the encampment in the face of an impending retaliatory eviction. For those of you who, understandably, are saying, ""this seems like just a bunch of interpersonal drama that I shouldn't care about"" I ask you this; what did these people stand to gain in the first place by removing Scott from power? They haven't changed any of the rules at the camp since he was voted out. Literally the only thing they care about is removing themselves from the abusive and coercive relationship he has cultivated with the residents. They did this knowing they would face a likely eviction because that is how important keeping him away from them is.

Anywho, I have a good amount of insight into the situation so I guess AMA if you have any questions. I clearly am on the side of the residents (though I am not one myself) so bear that in mind. We would like to invite any and all interested parties in joining us at the encampment this Friday at 7pm to see how it is set up, meet the residents, hear their stories, and see just how committed they are to keeping themselves off the streets, out of RVs, and running a tight ship at their encampment without the coercive presence of Scott Morrow.",,,,oofig,,,1455569177,t5_2qhad,t3_45yl2o,t3_45yl2o,14,1458518762,0,0,d012178,Seattle,14,,

"I'm not a resident of Nicklesville, but I've been helping with the defense and I can give some background. Nicklesville camps are claimed to be democratically run, but they're really under the thumb of a guy by the name of Scott Morrow who's had a very problematic history running the camps. He's been abusive to campers including [removing bathrooms as punishment, forcing folks to protest in exchange for shelter, and money mismanagement](http://www.seattleweekly.com/home/947180-129/share-seattle-morrow-shelter-shelters-homeless).

One alleged (I personally can't confirm what exactly happened) reason that he was voted out this time is because he mismanaged two rapes and subsequent suicide attempts that happened at the camps. Rev. Polly Trout, the director of another non-profit in Seattle related to social justice issues has [written in favor of waiting to evict too, pending a neutral inquiry](http://roominate.com/blog/2016/letter-from-polly-trout-to-mayor-murray/). That's fair.

What's not fair is that the campers voted Scott Morrow out, this is the third time he was voted out of a Nicklesville camp, and the reaction of LIHI and SHARE has been to play hardball against them. They're being given the choice to reinstate Morrow or get kicked out. No investigation. No arbitration. Nothing.

What you're seeing in the original post is a smear campaign against the camp. I was there. The place was clean (if a little muddy). There were no drugs. There's also a strong core group of folks who are helping run the camp right now including providing security.

And almost all of those people wait until the absolutely last possible second to do it too, leading to a whole group of drivers trying to cross multiple lanes of traffic in 500 or so feet. This predictably makes traffic worse since they seem to be the type of people who just slow down in the fast lane until they get a spot to merge into. Widening the access areas isn't going to force people out of the toll lanes to their exits at a reasonable time. The non toll times are nice since traffic is now terrible at 7, but this does next to nothing to solve the real problems with the ETLs making traffic worse for anyone not using them.

"Seattle has been absorbing people from other areas from its very beginning with wagons and horse riders.  In the 80's the Californians came, in the 90's - today, people from around the country and world came for the dot-com booms.  Locals at least used to learn fairly uniform driving rules in high school drivers' education.  But that program got eliminated about 15 years ago in cost cutting measures at the high school level.  Combine that with the numerous (and idiotic) left lane entrance and exit merging lanes, the loss of roadside space to pull over for accidents and engine failures (thanks HOV lanes!) -- and you have the current nightmare.  The highways are no longer highways during rush hour.  They are basically clogged county roads going through the middle of cities.  

I would be more in favor of the Dutch method of limiting speed limits during rush hour to 35mph and the zipper method works much better.

"I am one of those people you're looking up at, though probably a fair bit older than your age group. Making 6-figures in tech.  But also one of those who is a couple missed paychecks from catastrophe.  I've had 'friends' and former co-workers who can buy a house in Medina with only their checkbook.  I have many more friends &amp; peers in tech jobs that are in as tenuous or even worse situations than I am.  

Most of us have a LOT of unease ourselves.  At this moment I am part of a team that is likely out of a job in a couple months.

Many of us are just renters, and see no hope of buying a house in close.  We're here though because that's where the jobs are, and while cost of living may be less elsewhere in the country, our debts are fixed (mostly), so absolute dollars on the bottom line means a lot and thus we come here.

In tech, we don't have long term security.  Longest tech job I ever held was for 9 years.  From startup through acquisition by one of the biggest.  Nothing else has lasted even to 5 years.  Things change so rapidly; companies can be rocketing up one year and on their way to bankruptcy the next.  Working for the big established players is fraught with politics, annual stack ranking (and yankings), layoffs, re-orgs, project cancellations and so on.  Security is not there.

Mortgages, student loans, child support &amp; alimony, some medical debts, and so on..  even the time it takes to raise a child - those things last longer than the average tech job, and put an awful lot of pressure on the people that have them.  The time scale is out of whack.  Try being 40 and taking out a 30-year mortgage you can barely afford at the moment to buy our greatly prices homes - That's making a bet that nothing bad will happen to you or your income earning ability until well past the expected retirement age.   That keeps a LOT of us awake in the middle of the night.

The TL;DR is that a lot of us with those good tech job are guessing we will have to move away to retire or if something goes south for us due to cost of living and housing.

"OK, watched the video and debate.  Based on the viewpoints, I maintain my previous opinion - the city shouldn't jump into this any more than they have, and if that means Pronto goes away then so be it.

The folks that were in favor of saving Pronto seemed to have a multitude of reasons, many of which seemed shaky at best.  For example, ""people who can't afford to drive need options"" - yes, but an $8 a day bikeshare is not a good option; a bike can be purchased for $100, and you break even on that after just 12 days of riding.  ""Other cities do this, why can't we"" - cities are different, topography and weather is different, and just because it's working somewhere else doesn't mean we have to force it work here (in my opinion).  It doesn't make our city ""less cool"".  I believe another argument for saving this was that ""sponsorship money contributes greatly"", so we shouldn't be continually on the hook for more and more money because sponsorship revenue is strong.  But that assumes that sponsorship revenue will be there even as ridership struggles, and anyone who knows about sponsorships knows that companies want to be associated with a winning brand - when your brand starts losing, sponsors pull out and take their money elsewhere.  If I were the city, I would assume the worst case scenario - that sponsorship money may not be there, and that hole in revenue will need to be filled by someone..(the city).  

With regards to biking in the city, I think our stance should be this:  We facilitate conditions that will allow biking, including privately owned bike share companies, to thrive.  We should be concentrating our efforts here on building out bike infrastructure - *safe, dedicated* bike lines, more services for bikers that encourage bicycle commuting, and other creative bike solutions that can be taken advantage of by *all* riders - normal riders and bikeshare riders.  With those things in place, the city will become more attractive for a fully private bikeshare service that doesn't require city funding (aside from support on station locations).",,,,brianbot5000,,,1455657460,t5_2qhad,t3_4649ka,t1_d02axui,20,1458541517,0,0,d02dfal,Seattle,20,,

"Exercise is indeed good for you in so many ways.  Running is NOT a good idea for everybody, but there's probably some other activity that will have the same benefits if running isn't an option.

However, exercise is not a magic cure for serious clinical depression--much less bipolar disorder.  If you're advising exercise *in addition to* seeking professional help and possibly medication, great; if you're telling the OP they can get over it with exercise (or diet, or over-the-counter supplements, or getting more sleep, or positive thinking, or Jesus, or just sucking it up and getting on with life, or any of the other things well-meaning amateurs like to suggest to people with serious depression), and that they don't really need to seek professional diagnosis and treatment, that's NOT helpful.

"1. It's pretty obvious they've put more emphasis on property crime now. When someone tried to take my rolled up fence I was just calling to make sure they had a report of the attempted theft and didn't expect them to show up. The guy was long gone and nothing was actually stolen. They showed up in less than 10 minutes and encouraged me to keep reporting things so it shows in the neighborhood stats. She said it'll cause more officers to be assigned to the area.
2. Both crimes occurred in the same beat. It's south bitter lake technically, but I know the north precinct doesn't have tons of officers anyway. 

&gt;I'm not sure why you would try to help them though. sure they are 'small girls' and the suspect was 'pretty big' (although previously described as 'skinny').

I totally disagree with this. I've seen videos where cops are in an obvious life and death struggle and people just stand around. At that point it's about a person that needs help, not a trained professional. Also, he was described as skinny but probably 6ft 200lbs and both men/women with less upper body strength can be overpowered.
Either way yes, in some world they could have stopped struggling with him, stood up and started shooting at me. You could be right, but it was a judgement to call see if they needed a hand. I have a law enforcement background in the US Coast Guard as a boarding officer and if they needed I could have helped to some degree. As someone else mentioned, even holding down the dudes legs would be a big help.

False. I think so much of the time people confuse suburbs &amp; towns.

"Without commenting on whether the shooting was justified, I can't help but Monday-morning quarterback the officers' tactics. This shooting could have been safely avoided.

The officers gave the subject simultaneous orders, to both get on the ground and keep his hands up, while he was next to an open vehicle. If there was anything dangerous in the vehicle - and it appears there was - then these orders had the effect of preserving or possibly exacerbating the danger, by keeping the subject within arm's reach of whatever was in the car.

What the officers *should* have done is ordered the subject to place his hands on his head and back away from the vechile, before ordering him to the ground. This would have placed distance between him and whatever he might have tried to reach for in the car.

There are plenty of homeless people in the Seattle area that don't have addiction or mental health issues, many are just people that lost their jobs and haven't been able to get back on their feet.

Unfortunately many of the programs designed to help homeless people are so underfunded they have to prioritize who gets help; unless you are a pregnant woman, single parent, elderly or disabled, you won't get help.

"As a frequent user, my thoughts on other reasons why it's failing:

 * There are no accommodations for the rain. A simple canopy over the stalls so the bikes aren't soaking wet would be nice.
 * Very frequently, there will be four bikes at a station with three of them in ""repair"" mode and the forth simply unable to be dispensed.
 * Their helmets are tiny.
 * I've called Pronto and asked why I couldn't get the only remaining bike at my local spot.  They told me that the station's battery was dead...
 * Their gearing is too low.  I can't keep up with traffic on straight aways unless I'm practically sprinting to the point where I feel like I'm going to slip off the pedals.
 * The bells work on about 40% of the bikes.
 * 30 minute limit makes zero sense.  I've had to stop at interim stations on longer trips just to ""check-in"" and avoid a penalty.  Make it an hour.
 * Make it easier to find bikes (no first-party app? really?)
 * Even when they're working, the stupid key fob readers take at least 10 seconds worth of fiddling to make them work.
 * If a station is full when you try to drop off a bike, there's a way to get a 15 minute extension to go to another station, but it's buried in menus.  Again, a first-party app and loads of data could easily help users plan their trips so this never happens.
 * Many of the bikes won't stay in the highest gear (7) and just awkwardly pop back to 6th as soon as you apply any real pressure.
 * You're supposed to hit the wrench button on the stall to indicate a bike is broken, but there is absolutely no way to indicate *how* it's broken.  There's also no accountability for pushing the wrench button for no reason.",,,,ch00f,Lower Queen Anne,,1455062399,t5_2qhad,t3_44xskw,t1_cztt8ef,11,1458398181,0,0,czu40sz,Seattle,11,,flair

"Jesus, grow up.  I'm not trying to save the city and I'm not going to solve the social ills of America.  I'm trying to find the owner of what I suspect - but cannot prove - is a stolen bike.

What have you ever done except keyboard cowboy your way across Reddit?

Don't answer that.  I don't care.  And either does anyone else.

It's a 30 year old steel bike.  It's not the nicest bike ever, but clearly it's being used.  I don't know that it's stolen and I don't know that he's a crackhead - these aren't details I had the time or means to prove - and really, I don't care.  I suspect he's a tweaker of some marque (I have some experience with them), and I suspect the bike has an owner not him (it's way too big and I know a bit about bikes).  $20 later I'm in a position to look for the owner if there is one.  I posted the ad in CL after I put a flyer up at Recycled Cycles on Boat St before I even got home with it.  And now I've posted here to do the same.  I'm grateful for the kudos of course, but honestly am a little embarrassed to get them.  I'm doing it because if it was my bike, I'd be grateful if someone did the same.

As to why people move here, that's another factor too. The attitude of Seattle is really the attitude of Washington, Oregon, parts of Northern California, Alaska, and even Hawaii. 

I really don't get why people from other places in the country move here and think we all need to change to accommodate them. If you don't like it...leave.

&gt; Elwha chinook - the biggest salmon in the river and unique in Puget Sound - cruised right past the former Glines Canyon Dam site just three days after it was blown out of their way.

&gt; Three weeks later, they had muscled through the Goblin Gate and the Grand Canyon of the Elwha, heading toward the the river&amp;#039;s headwaters at the foot of Mount Olympus.

&gt; Locked up like jewels in a box behind the dam, rainbow trout native to the Elwha are once again going to sea as steelhead. That means the Elwha is being recolonized not only by adult fish entering the lower river, but by a cascade of out-migrating rainbows heading for saltwater.

"It's often the cheap offbrand lithium batteries in these. They are mass produced in China as no name models with often dubious voltage and amperage and wild mAh claims. E-cigs are high current devices and need quality batteries. Couple that with some e-cig users that mod their electronics to pull more amps and you have lithium batteries that vent and explode. 

I know about batteries from /r/flashlight but I've seen e-cig users talk about poor experiences there as both applications share the same battery types and sizes. 

I'd always recommend using only protected batteries (they have a PCB attached that cuts off the battery if amperage spikes too high) in high amp e-cigs, and only batteries from legit manufacturers (Samsung, Sanyo, Panasonic, etc) and not third party Chinese (Ultrafire, any brand with ""fire"" in the name).

"I moved to the US from India about 2 years back and live on the Eastside. You can guess which company I work for.

I grew up in a lower middle class family but surrounded by slums (projects). Both my parents worked. My mother got two degrees while working full-time with 3 kids. We never went to bed hungry but sometimes with half-full stomachs. I got a mechanical engineering degree with decent grades but it is very competitive in India (you know the population right?). My mother got us a desktop computer with money she saved up and I learnt to program on it. Long story short, I got into software engineering. 

I worked for very small companies in India when it was booming with outsourced projects. They looked for people with computer science background which I did not have. Your degree got you through the first screening process to get hired in big software companies. I know exactly how you feel. I felt like an urchin in a society that was fast-forwarding into a prosperous shiny future. I worked night shifts, middle shifts, day shifts. I think the books I read gave me perspective. But nothing prepared me for my go-getter best friend dying of cancer. I visited him a number of times until he wasted away and died. It made me vow to get out of the rat race, enjoy what I have and work for both enjoyment and money.

Well, let me not ramble on. I am not judging and am not able to avoid cliches here but I think it will help you to:

1. Gain some perspective. If you are generally healthy, can work towards a better future and have friends I think you are doing fine.
2. Work towards a goal that's difficult to reach but see gradual progress towards it. The future is better than what the politicians generally make it out to be.
3. Be optimistic. It's the attitude that counts. Good people are liked everywhere and that's more important.

Sorry if that came across as rambling / judgmental / condescending / useless but I really believe in the above.

Edit: Thanks a lot for the gold, dear redditor! I'm grateful for your time.

"Not at all, but the flip side is that the stock assumption on Reddit is that the homeless crisis is 100% about single mothers evicted from their cozy apartments by millennial Amazon code bros. 

The reality -- as anyone who interacts with homeless people tell you -- is quite a bit different. Obviously the plight of the mentally ill on our streets is brutal, and a tragedy. But the number of... let's call them hobos... who live, work and play in the stolen bike - meth/heroin - scumbag triangle  is non-trivial.

But honestly, for me personally, at the end of the day it's about littering. When you live in a gross nest of discarded needles and garbage, I start to lose sympathy for you.

"By my count, here's the list of things which happened on her watch.


Good:  Oso disaster response.

Good, but preventable: I-5 Mt. Vernon bridge collapse and response.  Not repairing old bridges is bad, but that was years of history behind it, the response once it collapsed was pretty good by all accounts.

Bad, preventable:  New floating bridge sponsons leak thanks to cheap concrete they bought from China, instead of giving the contract to local.  Just a hunch, but the entire state's concrete industry probably is fairly permanently angry on that one, and with some justification.  

Bad, somewhat unfair hindsight:  Bertha tunnel decision to go with one big tunnel with world-record-breaking tunnel borer, rather than dig 2 normal sized tunnels, for the same capacity and more proven results.  A tunnel borer the size of Bertha has never completed a project.  We got suckered into trying to be the first.  She was the owner of the project since 2012, a lot has been decided since then, a lot of it has been decided in a way that worked out fairly badly.

Bad, self-created: The arrogant and tone-deaf response to multiple peoples' problems with Good2Go, including hiding behind the ""it's outsourced!"" excuse rather than admit mistake of ""your dept. was the one that outsourced it.""

Any one of these 'bads' alone is probably not that big a deal, but put them all together and you have a pretty clear pattern of less than successful leadership.

Some a*holes who move here without learning the local road laws won't stop even when you step out beyond the parking zone and are right next to the travel lane.

For purposes of this section ""half of the roadway"" means all traffic lanes carrying traffic in one direction of travel, and includes the entire width of a one-way roadway.

While we're at it, this is why cars need to be 20 ft back from the marked and unmarked crosswalks, so you can step out and be visible even if a van or box truck parks at the end of the block.  The average car's length is 15 ft.

"The theory purpose is to stop terrorists on jetskis (or small speedboats).    The real purpose is to pay for the boat it's mounted on.

The logic works like this:

We need small fastboats (I think this one is an RBM- response boat medium- might also be an RBS, I don't know them well enough to tell without looking at the markings on the back) to pull idiots of of the water when they do idiot things.     

Problem is, no one wants to appropriate for rescuing idiots.   Let the free market sort out the idiot situation, says the ideology.     But JETSKI TERRORISTS!    We have to stop them.     So we'll need a machine gun- M240 in this case- to stop them.    

But there's another problem- it won't work from shore.    The sound is too big, we'll need a boat.   And it should be small, and fast.    And if you don't want to appropriate for it, you clearly love JETSKI TERRORISTS.    Tell me, congressman, why do you love skidooquaida?    

So we've established a need for the boat to mount the gun on.    And we'll need to be patrolling in it, so we'll also need to appropriate for fuel, and maintenance, and personnel time for training and familiarization.      A few MEs (maritime enforcement, the CG LEO rate basically) and MKs (mechanic rate) should be enough.    

They might attack ferries, but being vicious terrorists, they might go after our economy too, and that means commercial ships, so we should probably just patrol on the sound all the time.     What's that?    That has never happened, and probably never will?     Sounds like another operative of the islamic state of kawasaki &amp; yamaha.    

...and, since we're out there anyway, we may as well pull idiots of the water when they do idiot things.    And if we end up spending almost all of our time doing that, because idiots on the water are the norm and terrorism is a complete paper tiger with zero empirically justified systemic response, oh well, at least we maintained readiness.

KONG, virtual channel 16 (UHF digital channel 31), is an independent television station serving Seattle, Washington, United States. Licensed to Everett, Washington, the station is owned by Tegna Media, as part of a duopoly with NBC-affiliated station KING-TV. The two stations share offices and studios at the Home Plate Center in the SoDo district of Seattle, and KONG-TV's transmitter is located in the Queen Anne neighborhood of Seattle.

The station is usually carried on most cable television providers in Western Washington on cable channel 6, next to KING-TV's position on channel 5. The KONG call letters were retained as a tongue-in-cheek reference to King Kong, which made both stations easily marketable together.

What good does herbicide resistance do in environments where there isnt any sprayed?

There is nothing arbitrary about the USDA and NOSB prohibiting GE. The two are mutually exclusive in principle and philosophy. The NOSB is still fighting hard to strength those regulation to prevent erosion of Organic certification.

Modern GE has nothing to offer Organic ag, as synthetic herbicide resistance and dependance on high input fertilizers, is completely anathema to the the Organic growing environment.

Varieties that thrive in heavily pesticide sprayed and drenched in fertilizer environments are the same varieties that succumb to disease and fail to find nutrients in Organic environments. Organic varieties are better acclimated to their intended growing conditions and are better able to adapt as conditions change.

"These threads are always so exhausting.

I'll put this here, but I'm sure it could go anywhere that someone pipes up with a ""my experience has been great!"" anecdote.

You sound like a noob who could use some schooling.  I'm not trying to insult you.  I feel terrible for you because I've seen you guys come and go over and over again during my long career at Amazon.  Every year Amazon turns out guys like you to make room for a new set of bright shining faces.  It's exhausting to watch. I won't say how long I've been with the company because if I told the truth it would peg me down to an uncomfortably small number of people.  Let's just say if you throw my login into the old fart tool it'll make your eyes bug out.

Here's the deal.  There is a system at work at Amazon.  It's a system that generally speaking you are purposely kept in the dark about.  The rank and yank system is very much the ruling order of the day.  People in your org have been pushed out.  It happens every year.  Sometimes it's obvious, most of the time it is not.  If people are suddenly not there one day, they definitely got canned.  If they are quitting for ""career growth"" or ""boredom"" there is a fairly significant chance that they are getting canned as well.  People won't tell you that they are getting fired.  Two relatively new hires got fired from my team recently and I was impressed that even under the circumstances neither realized that the other was also getting fired. 

Part of the way this whole deal goes down is that they need you to not be so aware of the dagger hanging over your head.  It's very hard to do your job as a dev if your team isn't willing to cooperate with each other, so telling them they are in a Darwinian competition every year undercuts the ability to get the real job done.  But let me tell you, you will pay the price if you aren't aware of how the performance management system works.  You can't win a game when you don't know the rules.  And, yes, they do cut the lowest 10%.  Sometimes you get lucky and there is someone genuinely incompetent who's available for the cull.  Sometimes everyone is awesome, and it's a bit more like drawing straws.

Performance reviews are coming up.  Take this time to ask some serious questions.  I know you've had no training in how the performance management system works, but make it your business to find out.  They're going to give you a rank.   Know what that rank means and what the other possibilities are.  Know what you need to do to rise.  Amazon is very much up or out.  They take in a huge number of college hires and they try them out.  If they can't rise in two, best case three years, they are out the door.  If you are in this situation and you want to stay you need to be laser focused on rising.  Chances are high that your manager, who odds are has also been there for a super short period of time as well, is not necessarily looking out for your interests.  Even if you get lucky with a manager, the chances that your manager will change in the next one to two years is almost completely assured.  Your manager effectively controls where you rank.  Have a manager who doesn't like you and he won't feed you the work you need to keep you alive come review time.  Have a manager who can't effectively defend you and you'll get screwed when they go up against each other in OLR.

In the long run, it's all a losing game.  To make it as far as I have, you have to have talent, but also a fair amount of luck, more good managers than bad, and no intervening life events that could throw you off your game for part of the year.   When you finally get fired, I just want you to know what I tell everyone who gets fired.  After my long career at Amazon, I know more good people who have been fired than I know that are still at the company.  Don't blame yourself.  Move on to better things.

I've always liked Amazon for the people and the quality of the work, but as you can tell the way the performance management system works has gotten me down.  I get even more down when I see these threads full of people like you.  Invariably, the happy posters generally have two years of tenure or less.  There's a reason for that.  I feel like the company takes advantage of people's ignorance, and it upsets me.

In the end, I think the performance management system is destructive.  The winners will always be the people best able to look after their own interests and that means people who favor their interests over the best interests of the business.  It's too bad.

"**I-405 Express Toll Lanes Improvements**

Completed Adjustments:

* SB I-405 at NE 160th St: Added skip stripes to better define the start of second express toll lane and inside general purpose lane. (October 1st, 2015)

* NB I-405 at NE 6th St: Added clarifying pavement markings to eliminate driver confusion and extended existing access point. (December 18th, 2015)

* SB I-405 at SR 527: Lengthened access point to the north to allow drivers more time to merge into and out of the express toll lanes. (December 18th, 2015)

* NB I-405 at I-5: Lengthened access point to allow drivers additional time to merge to I-5. (January 22nd, 2016)

* NB I-405 access at SR 527: Lengthened access point to allow drivers additional time to merge in and out of the express toll lanes. (January 22nd, 2016)

* Entire Corridor: WSDOT made changes to the algorithm which calculates toll rates to respond to the demand for the lanes and to keep the express toll lanes moving. (Ongoing)

Planned Adjustments:

* SB I-405 at NE 6th St: Adding pavement markings to clarify for drivers the exit to NE 6th St and which lane continues onto I-405 southbound. (February)

* NB I-405 at SR 520: Adjust the access type and length to provide more open access to the express toll lane. This will improve general purpose congestion in the SR 520 interchange area during afternoon commutes and weekends. (March - weekend closure and weather dependent)

* NB at NE 160th St: Adding additional signage and lengthening access point to provide driver clarity and more time to merge to SR 522. (Next few months)

Monitoring on the entire corridor:

* Continue to monitor corridor traffic patterns and operations at these locations:

* SB NE 70th Pl to SR 520 - Evaluating greater access for Kirkland; NB and SB 3 lane section between SR 522 and I-5 - Evaluate options to address limited capacity in section of I-405 with three lanes; SB SR 522 to NE 160th St - Evaluate access improvements to address demand during morning peak

Future projects:

* WSDOT has not done detailed engineering or traffic analysis on the future projects listed below. Some of this work would need to be done to better understand costs and phasing opportunities for all options. Additional funding would allow WSDOT to better define the project's scope including the environmental needs and to conduct a practical design review of the larger capacity improvement projects.

* NB I-405 between SR 520 and NE 70th Place: Add northbound auxiliary lane between SR 520 and NE 70th Place. Timeline: Environmental document needed, 1-3 years open to traffic after funding approved. This timeline depends upon environmental impacts, such as fish passage. Cost: $5-30 million depending on existing constraints and environmental fish passage issue.

*  NB I-405 between SR 527 and I-5: Add a general purpose hard running shoulder on northbound I-405 from SR 527 to I-5. Timeline: Environmental document needed, 2 years open to traffic after funding approved. This timeline depends upon environmental impacts, such as noise walls, fish passage. Cost: $30-50 million

"Sadly PCC was one of the [major sponsors of I-522](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Initiative_522_%282012%29#Support). As much as like PCC, their anti-science and anti-GMO stance makes me thinks twice about shopping there.

Bottom line, genetic engineering is the most precise and well tested breeding method. Genetically engineered food crops are equivalent to their non-GE counterpart in terms of food safety and nutritional. We don't label any of the other breeding techniques (crossbreeding, hybridization, mutagenesis, chromosome manipulation), so why single out GE?

Articles like this demonize corporations that oppose mandatory GMO labeling, while ignoring the huge corporate support *for* labeling - mainly the organic industry.

Notice how the organic industry only pushes for GMO labeling, and not the other breeding methods. That's because mutagenesis and chromosome manipulation are used in organic agriculture.

Organic also bashes GMOs for the supposed increase pesticide use. Why don't they instead advocate for a pesticide label? Because organic also uses pesticides, something they try very hard to hide.

It's all about profit for the organic industry. Organic commands a huge markup, just look at [Whole Foods'](https://ycharts.com/companies/WFM/profit_margin) profit margin (4%) to [Kroger's](https://ycharts.com/companies/KR/profit_margin) (1.7%). The foods are equivalent in terms of safety and nutrition, yet the profit margin is over 2x with organic. The only way people buy organic is to fall for the perception that organic is somehow safer, while non-organic (which uses GMOs) is somehow unsafe. They are using labeling to make their product seem different.

"This map may show how far you can go on $50 of gas at today's price assuming you get ~20mpg, but it definitely does not show the distance you can go ""on one tank of gas."" At least not for any car I know of. (edit: Now thanks to /u/wisconsin_expat I know of a few!)

If you are spending $50 to fill your gas tank at today's ~$1.80 price, you have a 27 gallon gas tank. That is huge. The only vehicles I've seen that have tanks that large get barely over 10 miles per gallon.

Orick, CA (the southwesternmost point on that map) is [a 542-mile drive from Seattle](https://goo.gl/maps/R1DqnSVBbwv). To make that on one 27-gallon tank of gas you'd need to get 20mpg. I don't think there are many (any?) 20mpg cars that have a 27-gallon gas tank.

My car gets around 32mpg and the tank is about 10.8 gallons. The furthest south I could realistically go on a tank of gas is Roseburg, OR (nearly 200 miles short of Orick, CA). I suspect that the limit for most cars is similar.

Here's a cool tool for figuring out where you can go if you drive X miles from a starting point: https://www.freemaptools.com/how-far-can-i-travel.htm

Here's a 350-mile driving radius starting in Seattle via that tool: http://i.imgur.com/eBG2tww.png

And just for grins, let's calculate how far you could go on $50 worth of electricity in a Tesla Model S 85D.

[Range: 270-mile per charge](https://www.teslamotors.com/models). Cost of one full charge at Seattle's electric rates: $12.06. Total range on $50 = 1,120 miles, which looks like this (the tool does't work very far into Canada, it seems): http://i.imgur.com/dnSsfjC.png",,,,TheTim,"Tim Ellis, SeattleBubble.com &amp; timandjeni.com",,1454709970,t5_2qhad,t3_44cews,t3_44cews,39,1458315756,0,0,czpc5gk,Seattle,39,,flair verified

I've talked to people who actually think that the tax will actually have a positive impact because it will bring in money for prevention and possibly keep people from buying guns.

I'm honestly interested to see what the numbers are when they come out, I would not be surprised if:

* The city has actually lost a little bit of money
* Someone uses the decreased gun sales as proof that the tax is working at keeping guns out of people's hands, despite the lack of comparison to the areas outside of Seattle.

"I'm continually perplexed by the vitriol Seattleites have about having a growing, vibrant, and diverse city. Sure, some of the infrastructure and zoning laws are still lagging behind, but density in and of itself isn't a bad thing. Density done well means not having to drive your single occupancy car everywhere (and complaining about it on Reddit later) as many of your services needed (e.g. grocer, dry cleaning, restaurants, bars, etc) are all nearby, and plentiful. You have more vibrant, character-driven neighborhoods as a result when you don't actively promote a locals-only divide. Oh, and yes, locally-owned businesses can thrive in dense environments, too. 


Change is always going to suck when you're stuck in the mud complaining about ""how things use to be.""

"&gt; done an awful Job managing congestionThat's one way to look at it. Another way of looking at it is that providing a resource free of charge is doomed to run into supply issues.

The fact that people are willing to pay so much for tolls suggests 'free' access is a deal too good to be true, and possibly a big mistake  In managing congestion.EDIT - yeah, yeah, I know we have a gas tax.I'm not going to get into the weeds on how this doesn't fund as much as people think it does ( its like 25% of the trans budget, and shrinking). Instead: It's a terrible usage fee. The gas you burn on 405 almost certainly won't get preserved for 405 improvements. You'll pay the same tax whether driving on wide open road or clogged urban freeway. Drive a tesla or Prius and you'll consume the same limited resources (space on a freeway)with paying less cost.

"&gt; Getting straight answers about the bailout is tricky. Analysis of Pronto is being done by Mayor Ed Murray’s transportation department, which is stacked with bike-share advocates and led by a guy who used to work for the company operating Pronto.

...

&gt; Scott Kubly, Seattle’s transportation chief, was previously president of the dominant bike-share company and Pronto’s operator, Alta Bicycle Share. Earlier, he worked for Chicago and D.C. when they hired Alta.

&gt;In Chicago, Alta bid $8 million higher than competitors but won anyway, securing a 15-year contract worth $65 million. An ethics complaint said city staff members were cozy with the company.

"Spread among the 42 MILLION passengers that moved though SeaTac in 2015, I doubt you'll notice. 

When LAX raised their minimum wage to the minimal ""living wage"" ($11)in 2009, (from cca $7) they saw their supplier contract prices go up by less than 2%. Most places that raised their minimum wage to $11 actually saw NO INCREASE IN SUPPLIER COSTS (SF, LA, DC, the Feds). The increase simply removed excess profit from the vendors -- the vendors, simply ate the ""slightly higher costs). 

There is such a thing as raising minimum wage too high. $11 is nowhere near. $15 is closer, but still not there. 

Regardless, I doubt that the services in SeaTac will go up by anything close to 15% in cost. Maybe, we'll see 5% increase - MAYBE - mostly reflected in a few pennies extra in passenger fees absorbed in your plane ticket price. 

PS: Please also realize, that the Port of Seattle is a public corporation - ""the government"" - if they pay their employees (and their vendors' employees) shitty wage, those employees then have to turn around and get benefits. The employees hate the benefits - they have a job, they want to be self sufficient.; keeping he benefits flowing is a major PITA that interferes with their work schedule and life. The administration of welfare is also VERY expensive. You are literally asking the government to pay these people TWICE!! When you take the moment to think about this all, your paycheck can save a few pennies in airport fees, and then pay dollars in welfare support, or you can pay a few extra pennies, so these hard working people, working a full time job, can survive without having to go beg the government for a handout (which you'll pay for anyway). 

I am not a socialist, and have mixed feelings about welfare for the unemployed. But if a person is working 40hrs a week, S/HE SHOULD NOT NEED WELFARE TO GET BY. It's demeaning to the employee, and it's wasting taxpayer money. It's just an idiotic system. $11 showed to be a fantastic move. I have decent hopes for $15. We may find the turning point. But $11 as not it.

Why not see a local queen instead? :) Robbie Turner might still be in town at that point although she's recently started touring too so who knows. Any of the resident gals at R.place are good for some entertainment, or you can follow some of the more nomadic queens to see where they might be. The Markos sisters, the Paradiscos, the Manilas, Sparkle Leigh, Mama Tits, and Cucci Binaca are all good places to start.

"&gt;it's hilly as fuck and most people are weak.

Hills are only bad here if you're bad at routing, and if you take your time climbing it's not going to kill you.

Although a lot of people in this country seem horrified by the notion of moving their bodies for more than the 3 minutes it takes to walk from their indoor destination to/from their car. 

&gt;Seriously, you can't just grab a bike and go shopping.

Well, you can - and the Pronto ones even have a basket. 

&gt;Most roads don't have a dedicated bike lane and most businesses don't have bike racks.

There are quite a lot of dedicated bike lanes and paths in Seattle, and most roads in downtown are perfectly navigable without specific bike infrastructure - just don't ride in the gutter, take the lane. 

&gt;The second problem is that people underestimate the strength and fitness required to bike up even the shallowest of hills in Seattle let alone the monstrous ones. 

Every single day I watch people in their late 50s and early 60s climbing ""monstrous"" hills, they're often sporting a beer gut. Cycling around Seattle is not a Herculean feat of strength, and the people who do it regularly often don't even look ""athletic""


The biggest problem Pronto had here is the bad time limits (1/2 hour isn't enough to make it worthwhile), helmet laws, and a too-high price point. 


Edit: I should say that I don't really are whether or not Pronto survives, I've never used it and probably never will - however I get tired of the seemingly popular myth about how difficult it is to bike in general in Seattle. It's not, it's pretty easy and generally faster than cars and certainly faster than buses during commuting hours.

Everyone knows it's BS and probably won't stand up in court, but goes along anyways. Microsoft won't go around Temp Agency A, because they don't want to sour their relationship with their temp agencies.

"I work at a tech company and even I think it's bad.  I'm seeing folks who have been in this industry for 10 years being outbid on $800,000 houses all-cash. I agree with your sentiment 100% - I'm not sure how working-class Seattleites do it.

We have a new hire at my job who just came from Amazon and he enlightened me to something I had never considered; essentially, Amazon acts as a sort of ""conduit"" into the region, bringing in tons and tons of new hires who get paid a nice sum but only end up staying at the company for 2 years (until the cash advance terms are fulfilled). Then, when they decide to leave, they realize they actually kind of like Seattle (many come from out of state) and want to stick around. But there are only so many other places to find work, thus jobs are even harder to come by, and it puts a tight squeeze on the housing market as people decide to set up their homes here long-term.

"&gt;So here's the dilemma: It's one thing to see this information, write about it, and show up to counter-protest in force. But this all works to Roosh V's advantage. While the majority of people might be turned off by Roosh V's rhetoric, all he needs is for the conflict to hit a level of media saturation so that it reaches the men out there feeling most alienated and most rejected by women and general society. These are the people Roosh V recruits for his men's rights bullshit. He preys on people who have socialization issues, or issues with women, then exploits their fears and personal tragedies for the benefit of his personal brand.

&gt;This is a fairly common tactic. Donald Trump has employed something of the same strategy.

When I hear things like this I can't help but agree from a humanitarian standpoint, but my next train of thought is questioning how much in taxes he pays to support all of those freedoms that he wants.  I've always been taught that you've gotta pay to play.  I work damn hard to be able to afford a house with three shitters in it and happily pay my share into the system that allows it... the same system that seems to be increasingly bearing the burden of those that don't want to (or can't) participate.  

Don't get me wrong, I'm all for finding a suitable solution so people aren't suffering and I think that helping people start over is an incredibly important responsibility of our society and government.

"The only difference is that all the signs up a bubble are non-existent right now. 

There are a number of factors that are making this so bad. Excess money in China needing places to invest. The US Economy crash from decades ago and the lingering low interest rates. Banks holding on to foreclosures. Rentals as investments by huge corporations. Reverse Urban flight from jobless rural areas. The fact that every city across the US is growing, even small towns across the state that have never had these types of issues are now having them. A relatively decent job market. And of course people fleeing the inevitable climate change. 

I see prices leveling out at some point in the next five years, maybe possibly dropping 10% or so, as more homes and rental units come onto the market, but I don't see a whole sale price drops across the board caused by or creating an economic crash. 

The only way for that to happen at this point is for the city to suddenly become undesirable to live in, or several large companies go through a massive lay off at the same time. It'd take Amazon, Microsoft and Boeing to all cut work forces significantly for that to happen, and I just don't see a reason in the near future for that to happen.

The most obvious one for me is SB 405 approaching 520, a ton of traffic exits and crosses 3 lanes, creating a horrible new backup SB through Kirkland.

"I lived out of my pickup truck camper, then a camper van for a summer, and eventually my very own mobile home for 3 1/2 years.  So probably 4 years out of my life all told was spent in accommodations similar to what this is reporting.

In the end it didnt do much but delay the inevitable.  which was, I had to come up with a way to bridge between what I could make in that market and what I needed to live.  In that market, with wages depressed, my answer was leave.  It definitely opened the door to some things like access to sketchier people, because when you live on society's margins that's who you meet up with usually.

I think it's just stealing time to think you can make a long-term go of it in a ""Tiny home.""  The reason is under law it is still not Real Property.  So you'll always be one zoning change away or one landlord sell away from being truly fucked.  Plus your spiffy home is still seen by most as a trailer parked where it's not wanted.

I keep backyard chickens too. I also run into the issue of not getting home at dusk to lock up the coop and I let them free range during the day. A little while back I finally blew my money on an automatic chicken door http://www.chickendoors.com/. I went with the solar panel option with the light sensor. Best money I've sent yet on my coop setup! The light sensor automatically opens/closes the door in the morning and evening. It's super secure and in 4 years I have never lost a chicken. I don't have to get up at 5AM in the summer to let them out.

"I think you took that a bit too far - though I agree that they probably got off easy, aren't facing any repercussions, and will probably still be coddled for their ""traumatic experience"" (that they caused).

&gt; There isn't accountability for vaginas in the PNW

There is accountability, but you're correct in assuming it's a bit of a disparity. That's the challenge we face when women aren't taken seriously. They're overvalued as tokens of the community, not necessarily as individual human beings.

It's weird - because I agree with Feminists insofar as this issue leads to women being seen as infantile or powerless which is bad in contexts where they are trying to make a point or exert social influence, but it's also a huge boon in extreme situations where they're held accountable less often for their bad actions. Excuses abound, essentially... ""She was drunk"", ""She'd had a bad day"", ""He was asking for it"", ""She's so much smaller, what possible damage could she do"".

Of course, it's hilarious that nearly every Feminist I meet still shamelessly uses it to her advantage despite her misgivings with the OTHER side of it.

"Some homeowners get very territorial about their street-parking. If you're new to the neighborhood, you've probably parked in someone else's self-claimed spot. Perhaps you've parked in a way that takes two spaces instead of one. Maybe you encroached on their driveway cutout.

The small indignities of urban life sometime weigh heavy on the souls of people. Consider this someone's lame attempt at screaming ""fuck you"" into the universe in retaliation for some cosmic inconvenience you neither caused nor could know about. When we live near each other, we share our feelings in strange, often counter-productive ways.

There are no assigned street-parking spots, no matter what arrangements your neighbors have worked out with each other. You can't get towed if you're following the law.

""At trial, Taylor admitted that he and his codefendant, Alonzo Warren, went to Tip Top Trailer court to steal drugs and money from two women he knew from prior drug dealings. Taylor said he knew Warren was armed with a loaded gun.

Taylor and Warren first entered Amber Scherbinske's apartment. They demanded Scherbinske give them crack cocaine. Shortly thereafter, Shawn Cowell and Mike Keller walked into the apartment. Taylor and Warren searched Cowell and Keller and threatened to shoot anyone who lied about having drugs. Taylor also admitted telling Warren to shoot Keller because he thought Keller was reaching for a kitchen knife. Warren pointed the gun at Keller but did not discharge the weapon.

Taylor admitted taking approximately $8 from Keller and $20 from Cowell. Cowell also testified that a $25 money order was taken from her.


 
Scherbinske testified that Taylor hit and kicked her repeatedly and that she suffered bruises, a back injury, and what she believed was a concussion. According to Scherbinske, Taylor took about $30 in food stamps, $5 in currency, and a money order from her. Taylor denied taking any cash or a money order from Scherbinske.

After leaving Scherbinske's apartment, Taylor and Warren entered J.C.'s apartment. J.C., her eight-month pregnant daughter, K.C., Waylon Rickert, David Gernackey, and Gary Stark were in the apartment. Taylor and Warren demanded cocaine from J.C. At some point, Gernackey advanced towards Taylor. Taylor admitted hitting Gernackey with a six-pack of soda.

Warren then jumped up, pulled out the gun and told everyone to get down on the floor, ""this is a robbery[.]"" Taylor admitted throwing a bookshelf at J.C. after she began yelling at him.

K.C., Rickert, and Stark testified that Taylor pressed himself against J.C. in a sexual manner before dragging her into a bedroom. J.C. testified that Taylor raped her vaginally while striking her several times. She said she attempted to fight Taylor off but did not scream because she feared for her daughter's safety.

Taylor admitted dragging J.C. into the bedroom, but claimed that he did so to search her and the room for drugs. He denied sexually assaulting J.C. He claimed that he ""reached up, grabbed her pantyhose and pulled them down[,] separating her panties and her pantyhose"" to look for drugs. About five to seven minutes later, Warren yelled to Taylor that they needed to leave. Taylor testified that at that point, he ""walked up on the bed, I kicked [J.C.]. I spit on her and I turned and walked back in the living room.""

Before leaving the apartment, Taylor admits kicking Stark and taking money from him. K.C. testified she gave Warren food stamps in the hopes that he and Taylor would leave the apartment. After they left, K.C. observed her mother curled up ""in a little ball."" J.C. told Stark that she had been raped and called 911 to report the crime. J.C. stated that her recollection of the night's events were not ""too good,"" but she denied taking any drugs that night.""",,,,two_banana,,,1456346117,t5_2qhad,t3_47dwer,t3_47dwer,10,1458715321,0,0,d0cdo7t,Seattle,10,,

"I actually very much like living in my micro-studio, since it allows me to live within walking distance of where I work downtown.  Sure the main studio area is the size of an apartment living room but I've been able to make it work.

That said, I think I got really lucky in my search.  I visited three places  in November 2015 that had shared kitchens, odd floor plans (more on this below) and little to no kitchenettes.  Then I came across a place that was not only the same price as the other ones but had a full kitchen, a murphy bed and a decent floor plan.  Really, if you are okay going minimalist, okay making some sacrifices due to little to no storage, and not worried about trying to start a family in it then it can be worth it.

A few thoughts

-There is a lot of 'a la carte' options with Micro Studios, at least at the ones I looked at.  Want storage or a bike rake downstairs? $30 more a month.  Want parking? $120 more a month.  And so on.  So it might look cheaper on the surface but if you think you'll need all of that.... then  you might want to look at other options.

-Make sure you actually look at the floor plan and USABLE space.  So many places I looked at had vents in odd places, built in 'wall desks' in the only place where you could put a couch, electrical outlets opposite of where you want them, etc.  If you can find a  unit with good, solid usable space then its doable.  But if you can't have a chair or couch without covering up the bathroom door then you are probably going to be miserable.  I'd advise mapping out where you'll want to sit, eat, Reddit and Chill, etc. to make sure the layout fits before signing that lease.

-Make sure you have a decent view that allows you to keep your blinds open.  This is just my humble opinion, but being in that small of a space can be mentally taxing if you look out into a wall or something.  Yes you'll pay a premium for a really good view, but if you have to leave your blinds shut the entire time because the random homeless person living in the shuttered house next store keeps looking in your window... you're going to have a bad time.

-Along those lines, remember that this city is growing like crazy.  A lot of places I looked at were trying to charge me uber premium prices for a great view... but taking a second to walk around the area and do some research online suggested that that view would be blocked by a new building (or at least construction) within a few months.  And were not talking skyline view, were talking like 10 feet away from my window.  I'm pretty confident they won't lower your rent if your view gets blocked by that new building.

Hope that helps, and good luck in your search.

EDIT: Not sure if this is against the rules but here is the building I'm in.  For reference its about $1200/m

"As somebody who lives in this neighborhood, and shops at that Red Apple, I'm of mixed mind. One the one hand, the fear of gentrification (which I as a middle class white man am guilty of contributing to) - there are a lot of nice not-wealthy people in my neighborhood. I hope they benefit from this, but I worry they'll just get priced out of their own apartments and homes.

On the other hand, that Red Apple is, literally, the *worst grocery store I've ever shopped at*. And I used to live in a completely shit neighborhood of Washington DC where the grocery options were either too expensive, or the food was rotten. The Red Apple at Jackson and 23rd is filthy, and the produce is terrible. So any improvement to the grocery aspect is fine by me. I'd be happy with a QFC.

To be nice, the Red Apple has a good liquor cabinet and the employees are friendly. So that's good.",,,,TomorrowPlusX,The CD,,1455841552,t5_2qhad,t3_46hdxi,t3_46hdxi,17,1458590971,0,0,d058nt5,Seattle,17,,flair

"&gt;  Exactly! Your home values goes up by 15%, so the taxes goes up 15%.

To be clear, this is not what happens in most counties in Washington (not speaking for King, I'm not going to take the time to be certain, but I'm fairly sure).

The total amount taxed is calculated first, including acceptable increases, new levies, taxies, fees. That amount we'll call $x.

Then, $x is divided among all property owners, based on a formula that is largely based on assessed value (but not exactly).

If your home goes from $y to $y+10%, but homes in the county went up by an average of 13%, your taxes may not go up at all (they may actually be flat, because relative to your neighbors, your house has gone down, so your proportional share is lower).

If your home goes from $y to $y+15%, but on average the other homes in the county went up 9%, then you'll see a larger bill for both the new levies and the proportionally higher value.

"Here's the thing, though: It's in the culture that you should be gentle with people's feelings. So if your boss was just like ""change this sentence"", people would assume that he's really angry/upset/asshole-ish, because he couldn't even be bothered to put in the 30 seconds to to say something nice, especially when it's to someone he works with regularly. 

In another explanation:

West coast people:

    insults |----------------rude---neutral---nice---| flattery

East coast people:

    insults |---rude---neutral---nice----------------| flattery

So what you perceive as neutral as an east coast person is considered really mean/rude on the west coast.

"Median King County home price in 1995 was $225k. (It is now 451k.)

1995 saw 30 year interest rates go from 9.15 in January to 7.2 in December. Most of the year was around 7.5, so that's a $1260 mortgage payment on a 180k loan. 

$1260 * 12 = $15120 annual tax bill, which equates to a 1.5 million dollar house.

"The problem that Seattle is trying to fix may not be the problem that you have in mind.  

There are ~400 people living in the jungle, each producing ~1lb of excrement a day.  The hill slope in that area means that this untreated sewage eventually flows into the Duwamish.   In addition to the excrement, the presence of the Jungle has compromised the catch-basin underneath I-5, meaning that run-off from the interstate also heads to the Duwamish. Government has invested in the cleansing of that river and they have monetary incentive to limit the environmental damage, both to it, and surrounding areas. 

Additionally, the emergency response for the homeless population (Jungle in particular, and other homeless in general) costs the city a lot of money. The shootings are a recent example but more generally, the fuel stoves used by the homeless population are poorly maintained and prone to fire (outbursts occurr regularly and often without much press).  Add in all the trash, unmitigated drug use, and pillaging of supplies from nearby facilities, and it adds up to a large financial burden on the city. 

The city may well be spending time and effort on this problem not out of compassion, but for damage control and loss-mitigation.

If Kubly were exploiting his former relationship with that company - if he were still getting paid by them, for example, this would seem to be a clear problem. But I don't have evidence of that. 

Motivate/Alta operates the bike share system in Seattle, but does not own the equipment (source 3, below). Seattle's purchase, from the non-profit Puget Sound Bike Share, of Pronto assets, would not seem to benefit Motivate/Alta directly, (except in that it helps safeguard the company's existing contract to operate the system)(source 3, below). 
Again, if Kubly were getting a kickback, that would be a problem, but we have no evidence of that. 

Kubly is out through February 19 on a honeymoon. I'll reach out again to Kubly after that to get a more detailed response.

Sources: 
Source 1: Scott Kubly's LinkedIn site, 
Source 2: Holly Houser, former executive of Puget Sound Bike Share, and 
Source 3: Rick Sheridan from Scott Kubly's office, who was not able to answer very much in Kubly's absence but listened and nodded to these points over the phone.

"As someone in the software industry and making what you say we make: You're not being unreasonable. Income inequality is a real thing and it's an increasingly huge problem. But I think nobody knows what to do about it. Among my friends, we talk about increasing public transportation, and providing affordable housing. Those will help, but I'm not sure they would completely fix the problem. And they will be many years in the coming.

The other thing to keep in mind is that even $70k to $100k is not a lot of money. Everything is relative. When you're working with people who bought into the housing market during the crash, $100k doesn't go very far. Even two people making $100k can barely afford a house in north Seattle, especially if they have children and therefore need to pay for childcare. (I'm talking about a house in nice condition, either with cash to fix it up or already ready to live in.) All the new town homes are being sold at $600k-$900k price range, and when you consider your mortgage should be 2-3x your annual salary... it's not like they have money either.

Something's gotta give. If you read Seattle Bubble (or any other realist column), there is supposed to be a tech bubble currently. However, when it will pop? Probably not this year or next.

Basically, rampant mold growth happens at [70% and higher](http://www.fsec.ucf.edu/en/consumer/buildings/basics/moldgrowth.htm).  Human comfort is [optimal between 25% and 60%](http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/relative-humidity-d_895.html); below that feels uncomfortably dry and will be rough for skin, above that feels uncomfortably wet, dank, and stuffy.

Optimal stability of wood is achieved between [40% and 60%](http://www.healthyheating.com/Thermal_Comfort_Working_Copy/Definitions/humidity.htm) humidity.

In your particular case, since you are actually getting enough liquid water to notice on your carpet, I think you're going to have it running a lot of the time during the winter.  

I personally would set it to 45-55%, and find it worth eating the electric bill to not have mold growth.  (Thankfully, electricity is relatively cheap here.  In New York this is very expensive)

Granted, I don't own a house here, but this isn't so different than in New York, although due to higher general humidity most of the year, I'd expect much more dehumidifier run time.

"Unless you are really going out of your way, none of those places are along the route to West Seattle.   

The reason that there have been so many studies on the Ballard Line is because there are a ton of people who live in dense neighborhoods between Downton Seattle and Ballard.

There aren't as many decisions between downtown and West Seattle.  They know where they need to branch off.  They know how they would need to cross the ship canal.  They know what neighborhoods would have to be served first based on where the line will hit first.  And that stop at the Junction or nearby will likely be all they can afford on ST3.

Elliott Bay Pier, Seattle
One of Seattle’s best-kept fishing secrets, this idyllic fishing pier offers covered cleaning stations and a little bait shop that serves espresso! 
At the bottom of the Magnolia neighborhood at Pier 86, Seattle

Green Lake Park, Seattle
Green Lake offers year-round fishing, and they typically fill the lake with trout in early March. Kids (and parents!) can fish for rainbow trout, brown trout, largemouth bass, rock bass, yellow perch and catfish. The Bathhouse Theater area (south side) and Small Craft Center (east side) make for good spots.

Mount Baker Park, Seattle
Kiddos can fish from the shores of Lake Washington. There’s also a small playground and a beach. 
2521 Lake Park Dr. S., Seattle

Seacrest Park, West Seattle
Located on the West Seattle waterfront, Seacrest Park boasts some of the best views of the Seattle skyline. It’s also a great spot for fishing. The boathouse rents small watercraft, and the Elliott Bay Water Taxi travels between the Seacrest Dock and Pier 55 in downtown Seattle.

In the 30's there were Hoovervilles all over the place. In the 1890's to 1920's, from what I've read, the problem was a lot worse than it is today. We even had a really rough district called The Tenderloin which was just between Pioneer Square and Chinatown which makes modern day Seattle seem positively tame in comparison. There is a really great book called You Can't Win which is an autobiography of a hobo who traveled the west in search of drugs and safes to crack. His description of Seattle gives the impression that it was pretty much the crime capital of the West Coast at the turn of the century. The book ended up being a major influence on William S.

When you join the flow in other, more adept motoring cities, you see most drivers constantly making little adjustments for each other: speeding up or slowing down to maintain pace, letting people in quickly and smoothly, anticipating other cars' need to get into desired lanes, etc. Very little of that happens here; most drivers seem unaware of what's going on around them.

Bike rental seems like it would appeal to very casual riders and tourists, who look at hills and take easier options (that's my experience downtown - I see a lot of Pronto ""riders"" pushing their bikes up hill).  If bike rental *is* a viable business here, then someone else will figure it out even if Pronto has not - on their own dime.  I think the money (I heard $1.4 million somewhere) would be better spent on a new bike lane, or on making existing bike lanes safer.

"What, you don't like having to pay $10 to make it to work on time? /s

All this shows is that WSDOT has done an awful job at managing congestion and it's hurting drivers enough that they are willing to pay substantial amounts to get out of the intentionally slowed main lanes. 

This is more a measure of how bad it is than anything else.

Edit: as this comment has some visibility, I think it's also worth pointing to u/foxhound199 s comment below about revenue versus overhead. 

Edit 2: A few points that caught my attention:

-WSDOT projected revenue was $1 million and they brought in $3.7 million (tolls only). 

-They grossed $5.2 million and spent $2.7 million, meaning that even with the windfall, WSDOT is spending significantly more than half of what it takes in on overhead. Also much of the initial revenue was in the form of passes that will not be recurring, unlike expenses.

Housing is rising at 4x wage growth. Interest rates at almost zero for 8 years. 3% down mortgages are back, and so are 'liar loans'. Commodities rolling over, oil rolling over.  

Granted, this time around real estate will not be a leading cause of the recession, but it will certainly be directly affected by the recession. 

But yes, this means waiting it out. Houses around Seattle started around 500k. A 20% savings on that is $100,000. If you waited 5 years that is like getting paid $20,000 a year to stay in your apartment. For most people that is like living rent free.

"&gt;It's weird - because I agree with Feminists insofar as this issue leads to women being seen as infantile or powerless which is bad in contexts where they are trying to make a point or exert social influence, but it's also a huge boon in extreme situations where they're held accountable less often for their bad actions. Excuses abound, essentially... ""She was drunk"", ""She'd had a bad day"", ""He was asking for it"", ""She's so much smaller, what possible damage could she do"".

&gt;Of course, it's hilarious that nearly every Feminist I meet still shamelessly uses it to her advantage despite her misgivings with the OTHER side of it. But people are generally selfish - it doesn't make being a Feminist a bad thing, they're just normal selfish people like everyone else. Using an agenda to get ahead.

I've never seen any group of people portray women as infantile and powerless as much as feminists. It's pathetically transparent how they flip flop between women being powerful or helpless depending on the issue. 

Setting that aside, the fact that none of the women involved in this will face any repercussions is terrible. It's just another example of women seeing that they can be violent towards men and get away with it.

"&gt; Is this a problem here?

Fare evasion is somewhere between 3-7%, which is in line with other proof-of-purchase transit systems.

&gt; Why doesn't the metro just have turnstiles?

This would work at controlled-access stations like Beacon Hill, but a number of stations are at street level (the ones on Rainier Ave.).

Other systems go back and forth between turnstiles—SkyTrain in Vancouver and the Tyne &amp; Wear Metro in Newcastle, UK are two systems I know that have vacillated on the usefulness of turnstiles.

Waitress might as well have been the invisible woman.

Food took ~45mins after we ordered. I can forgive that, it was really busy in there.

But my food was cold (well lukewarm at least), the potatoes were under-cooked, the english muffin (Eggs Benedict) was sliced but not toasted or grilled. Another order was wrong, and was replaced (admittedly, much quicker). We had a party of 4, 1 of the drinks never arrived, but it was ok she was happy with water. 1 of the drinks arrived about 15 mins after the food did, but at least it arrived. ($2.50 for a *can* of sprite!)

The fruit buffet looked good, but was not included with my meal so I didn't get a chance to really try it.

I will say this, despite being cold, and not cooked correctly, it was at least rather tasty, and I finished it.

I'm trying not to hold it against them, as it was packed and they were quite busy, but I can't say it was a great experience.

"Seattle is a polite place (probably due to Scandinavian history). People who don't like you at all will be friendly and nice to you because that's how people are here. It's what one does.

The Seattle Freeze happens when newcomers mistake superficial politeness for actual affection. A Seattleite may invite you to go to ""lunch sometime"", just to be civil, even though they would not ever *dream* of actually siting down with you to get food. The trick to navigating the freeze is simply to learn to tell the subtle difference between real friendly and fake friendly. It's not hard. 

The Seattle freeze exists to some extent in all the northern pacific coastal cities. If someone doesn't like you in New Jersey or Texas, say, you will be able to tell immediately from how they treat you. Here, not so much.

Also, all the forced fake friendliness makes people secretly resentful and bitter. The anonymity of reddit allows them to stop being nice for second, which is why Seattleites' reddit manners are so incredibly atrocious.

"Ugh.  I hate vapers mostly because of what they've done to the battery market for 18650s (I rebuild ebike battery packs and other similar packs, and constantly have people ask why I'm using these expensive low capacity cells when you can get these super high capacity cells for a fraction the cost).

They lie, lie, lie, and then like some more, sell it for $0.99, and vapers will buy lots of it.

The highest energy capacity ""honest"" 18650 out there is about 3600mAh at 4.35v, and costs a pretty penny.  Anything with ""FIRE"" in the name will claim radically higher capacity (4000, 5000, 6000, 8000, whatever - it doesn't matter, it's all lies), deliver somewhere between about 500mAh and 1500mAh, and stand a very good chance of being a recycled laptop cell with a new metal end tacked on over the original one that shows the weld scars.  Two from the same shipment will almost certainly not have the same capacity, which makes it dangerous to put them in a serial pack.  You might get a cell that can safely handle high amp draws, but probably not.

Then they're used in mechanical mods (which, for those unfamiliar, consists of a battery and a rather low resistance coil - ""sub-ohming"" is a thing that refers to a very low resistance coil - you literally mechanically connect the coil to the battery with a button, no electronics at all) which draw serious amounts of current and have no low voltage cutoff.

Put all of this stuff into a tube with no vents, and when the battery finally says ""enough"" and vents, there's nowhere for the massive amount of generated gas to go, so the whole damned thing blows up.

If you think of them as a pipe bomb stuck in your face, you have a good idea of the characteristics of a lot of the devices.

Sadly, I'm not aware of protected batteries that will handle the type of current people want for ""sick clouds"" or whatever the hell it is they want 30A for.  Most of the protection boards are good for a few amps, at best, since they're designed for flashlights and similar lower draw items.

I think it's possible to vape safely with a well controlled device, but the amount of hazardous disregard for battery safety I see in that community is terrifying.  It's a testament to the battery makers that they only blow up rarely.",,,,Syonyk,,,1456068235,t5_2qhad,t3_46ual6,t1_d07z5yh,12,1458641121,0,0,d085a8g,Seattle,12,,

"A counter-point to that. We were renting a duplex on Queen Anne when our son was born in 2012. In 2015 we bought a house near mill creek in unincorporated snohomish county. Our reasoning: with a baby, we were paying a lot to live in a central location but we didn't get out much. what does proximity to culture do if you're not in a position to really take advantage daily? we made it to the market or beach a few times a month so what's adding a small drive? 

we also now have a small yard, and we live on a street with little traffic, so we can actually play outside. we couldn't do that before, and if we did, the issue with drug needles and drug users in the parks was a total turn off. more and more, it seems that living in seattle means your kids are going to have to confront in a very real and very visceral way the absolutely tragic human cost of chronic drug use and the safety concerns that come with it. that's not a cultural experience I want for them to be around all the time.

a common misconception is that if you move out of the city you're going to be in a white, conservative monoculture. while you can certainly find that, my street has african american, indian, asian, and arab muslim families. And that's just my street, which has maybe 20 households. The muslim family teaches arabic lessons out of their home, and my now toddler-age son is able to interact with that culture regularly.

lastly, and this is the big thing, we can actually afford to live out there. we have a decent sized house that is not attached to our neighbors. for what we could afford, the BEST we could hope for in seattle was a small condo. In our current spot, we can have a dog, we can plant a garden and grow our own food, etc. How awesome will it be for my kid to grow up having the ability to garden, play with his dog in a safe environment, and go to a good school with kids on the street from diverse cultural and ethnic backgrounds?

And guess what? we still go into Seattle once or twice a month. Recently we took him to benaroya hall for a jazz show designed for toddlers. All the culture Seattle has to offer is still accessible. By moving to the suburbs you don't somehow get turned away at the door when you want to do stuff. you just have to plan for it. which honestly it takes just as long by bus to get places sometimes as it does to drive in from snoho county.

none of this is saying that if we couldn't get a nice house on greenlake, we wouldn't. we absolutely would. we loved living in the city.

but millennials (i'm barely one at 34) in this city have to live in the world we have, not the one we wish we had. which means that unless you can afford a 500-800k mortgage when you're just starting out then you have to see what you can afford and make the best of it.

and i have to say, it's really not that bad. it's what you make of it, and you'll find you aren't alone. several families on my street that recently moved in are just like us and were pushed by the same market forces into the same decisions. we have a lot in common with similar values, which has been a nice surprise.

edited to add: i also firmly believe you should live relatively close to where you work. so I got a new job that is close to where we live. it actually paid better, so it was a good decision. to make the jump out of seattle, for us, it was a take it or leave it type thing. new place to live, new job. seattle is a place you visit, not a place you live. we could make that choice, but clearly not everyone wants to/can do that. everyone's situation is their own and we all make our choices :)",,,,Second3mpire,Snohomish County,,1456338561,t5_2qhad,t3_47du35,t1_d0c6mj0,33,1458712621,0,0,d0c7xy5,Seattle,33,,flair

It always turns out they were shot while committing assault or reaching for a gun, usually right after they were committing some other crime, but then a bunch of people who only know the situation from initial media reports get pissed off as if they know exactly what happened.

If these are the best examples of ""the system going wrong"" protesters can come up with, it suggests that the system is not so bad afterall.

"I don't see how anyone can be surprised by this.  Name one bikeshare system, worldwide, that succeeded in the face of a mandatory helmet law.

(For that matter, name one bikeshare rider who has died from head injuries in all the cities across the U.S. that have millions of bikeshare rides without helmets.)

Seattle/King County's helmet law was based on a study that has since been repudiated by the Federal government as junk science.

Actuarial analysis makes it clear that mandatory helmet laws for adults actually harm public health by discouraging a safe, healthful activity.  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22462680

Helmet legislation = no association with injury rates in Canada.
More butts on bikes = lower hospitalization rates for cyclists.
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4636599/



""Even if we were to ignore the data from Australia and elsewhere and agree that bike helmets might still be substantially effective in preventing potentially fatal head injuries, the failure to observe any such beneficial effect in either short or long term time series data must imply that helmeted cyclists are still managing to get themselves killed at roughly similar rates to their formerly unhelmeted counterparts""   http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1432177/


""The risk of getting a head injury per kilometre wearing a helmet relative to the same risk without helmet is the most appropriate measure to assess the effectiveness of the bicycle helmet. Due to lack of data on exposure rates, odds ratios of helmeted versus unhelmeted cyclists for head injury and other injuries on hospitalized victims are broadly used in case-control studies.
A general necessary and sufficient condition can be formulated rigorously, for which odds ratios indeed equal risk ratios. However, this condition is not met in case-control studies on bicycle helmets. As a consequence, the real risk of cycling with a helmet can be underestimated by these studies and therefore the effectiveness of the bicycle helmet can be overestimated. The central point is that a wrong estimate of the risk for non-head injuries (the controls) paradoxically
can lead to an overestimation of the usefulness of the helmet in protecting against head injuries.
Three cases could be found in the literature with sufficient data to assess both risk ratios and odds ratios: the Netherlands, Victoria (Australia) and Seattle (U.S.A). In all three cases, the problem of overestimation of the effectiveness of the helmet by using odds ratios did occur. The effect ranges from small (+ 8 % ) to extremely large ( &gt; + 400 %). Contrary to the original claim of these studies, in two out of three cases the risk of getting a head injury proved not to be lower for helmeted cyclists. Moreover, in all three cases the risk of getting a non-head injury proved to be higher for cyclists with a helmet.
It must be concluded that any case-control study in which the control is formed by hospitalized bicyclists is unreliable and likely to overestimate the effectiveness of the bicycle helmet.
As a direct consequence, also meta-analyses based on these case-control studies overestimate the effectiveness of the bicycle helmet. Claims on the effectiveness of the bicycle helmet can no longer be supported by these kind of studies. This might explain the discrepancy between case-control studies and other studies, such as time-analysis. It is recommended to use other methods to estimate the risk ratio for the bicycle helmet, along the lines described in this article.""

"There are 4 such bills that have recently been introduced in WA alone. There are many many more across the nation. 

It is important to note, that transgender people in WA have had these protections since 2006. The Human Rights Commission felt the language regarding public bathrooms needed to be more explicit, that is what was put in place in 2014 (with community feedback, hearings, etc).

Because the republican party is pretty much fueled by bigotry at this point, and it is an election year, this has become a political issue. It is shameful, and it will be stopped. I am not a lawyer/political expert, but the odds of any of these bills becoming law is small. Inslee would veto any one of these bills, and there is talk that most of these bills would not hold up to judicial review. 

Of course, passing these bills really isn't the goal of these senators. The goal is to add more bigotry fuel to their re-election campaign in the coming months.

"Why do you need a barcode on cigarette butts to make them eligible for redemption?  That's not the case with can/bottle deposits in other places.

I like to give the officers the benefit of the doubt because I feel like most of them are just normal guys trying to do honest work.

"Hi there!  I'm following up from my earlier post where I said I wanted to reply to this comment.  Anyhow, just a copy-pasta since I'm lazy:

[Here is a study you may find interesting.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2892765/)  One of the more telling excerpts:

&gt;A double blind study subjected 55 overweight youth to 13 weeks of a 1,000 Kcal diet accompanied by daily capsules of aspartame or lactose placebo. Both groups lost weight, and the difference was not significant. Weight loss was attributed to caloric restriction [27]. Similar results were reported for a 12-week, 1,500 Kcal program using either regular or diet soda [28]. Interestingly, when sugar was covertly switched to aspartame in a metabolic ward, a 25 percent immediate reduction in energy intake was achieved [29]. Conversely, knowingly ingesting aspartame was associated with increased overall energy intake, suggesting overcompensation for the expected caloric reduction [30].

A lot of the pitchfork wielding against artificial sweeteners is from making spurious conclusions from partially understanding research studies and not fully grasping why certain responses are the way they are.  In the above quote, note how people who UNKNOWINGLY ingest aspartame ingest fewer calories, while those who KNOWINGLY ingest it ingest more.  In other words, while substituting sugar for aspartame in drinks may not result in weight loss, a significant part of that likely comes down to silly human nature, and the thinking that ""hey, I'm drinking diet soda, so I guess it's cool for me to have this candy bar.""  Artificial sweeteners can help with weight loss, but you need to avoid falling into the trap that drinking something less bad than the sugar drink gives you free reign to eat more of other stuff.  This can be tricky, because drinks sweetened with either sugar or low-calorie substitutes will increase appetite (due to the sweet flavor, not do to the aspartame in the body, as proven by the aspartame capsule study).  In all, consuming a lot of sweet things will make you want to consume even more sweet things.  Going less sweet is obviously ideal, but eliminating it entirely is unrealistic, cuz let's face it, you have to be a real dick to deny someone their birthday cake.  In summary, artificial sweeteners taken responsibly isn't cause for alarm, they are less bad than sugar in it of themselves, but you need to be vigilant about not overindulging.",,,,Zeydon,,,1456118549,t5_2qhad,t3_46vtbp,t1_d08q096,10,1458655559,0,0,d08zbg2,Seattle,10,,

"Hey, ‘Successful’ person here - I make a big six figure salary from my business, although I never had the privilege of going to college. But completely know how you feel. I used to earn less than you in my mid 20s working in a cell phone store and couldn’t keep up with my rent, couldn’t afford emergency expenses, credit card bill getting bigger every month just for survival! Putting together a budget and shit just not adding up. Digging coins out of the back of the sofa to try to put money together for a meal - it sucks. I remember wondering the exact same thing as you.. ‘how the fuck does anyone survive?’ and ‘how does anyone afford to do drink?’

Are you being unreasonable? Absolutely not. It’s normal to feel that way, feel that the system is rigged against you, seeing gratuitous displays of wealth and feeling envy and frustration and just hating everything. It makes you feel better. for a little while. But is it constructive? Does it help you in the long run? No.

Those feelings exist to move you into action. Thats why you started this thread. My advice to you is to turn those feelings into a motivational force to drive you into a constructive direction. There’s lots of people in this thread advising you to move to the suburbs, move to a more affordable area, that’s one option.

It sounds like you are a college educated person who wants to live in the city and earn the type of salaries your friends are making, which is completely understandable. I dont know enough about your situation to give you a suggested roadmap on how to achieve that, but maybe you should try? If you put a plan together and acted on it, and motivated yourself to action, then achieved your goals, would you feel a lot better? I think you would. Then those feelings that caused you to do that in the first place would make a lot more sense, and be justified.

There’s a lot of resentment towards the tech community, from people who aren’t interested in tech. Well tech isn’t going anywhere and as they say, if you can’t beat em, join em. If your major isn’t in software engineering perhaps you can get involved in an environment that specialises in catering to this market? service businesses, real estate, office furniture, whatever. The market rewards people who adapt to a changing environment. By going against what is essentially a force of nature, you will lose. 

Of course, I don’t know what your degree is - if you studied as a marine biologist and thats where your heart is, obviously pursuing that path would be your smartest option. But it sounds to me like this $14 an hour thing isn’t working for you, so listen to those feelings and deal with the situation. Figure out how to live on $14 an hour and make those feelings go away, or do something about it. Don’t fall into the trap of blaming the market. Listen to the market and figure out a way to make it work for you. A lottt of people out there in the developing world dream about living in a place like the United States so they could have the same opportunities available that you do. You are not an uneducated slave working in a seafood processing plant in China. You are in America god damn it. Millions of opportunities exist.

"I live near the I-5 and there is a constant cycle of homeless people setting up camp there, trash it(why would they literally shit where they eat/sleep??), discard dirty needles and strip stolen bikes, then the council ""evict"" them after a few weeks, clean it up and put up a sign. It happens every month or so. I never see cops go near the area. 

I sympathize with the homeless population. But just building houses and giving it to them brings up 2 questions nobody has a good answer to:

1) Seeing how many treat any public space they take over, won't they just trash/strip the houses - costing more money?

2) What is stopping homeless people from every other state just moving here for a free house? In the summer a lot of homeless people travel up here from California.

"I'm in the exact opposite sort of switch right now (moving from Seattle to NYC - just scored a place in Ridgewood actually), and to be honest, all the things you've noticed are not in your head at all. As a native Seattleite, that shit has always bothered me.

The way I'd describe the Seattle way would be to not make any huge waves vocally - the way you do that is to keep to yourself (for the most part) and don't raise a huge fuss about whatever, then maybe at a more convenient time, you tell the person in private what they did wrong (remember to not embarrass them - remember, Seattle is always smaller than you think, people are apt to remember random bits a bit more clearly and care a lot more about it.)

Also, yeah, it's awkward as fuck at music shows sometimes. The non-dancing in any remotely dancy set (or the awkward dancing in a *really* dancy set only near the front of the stage) and the slight nods in the back (don't nod TOO hard there!) kinda gets on my nerves.

One more thing: it's incredibly cliquey. Be prepared to spend at least a year or two to find maybe one or two solid friends.

Even if Harper thought a woman had just been hit, he should've called the police rather than trying to take justice into his own hands.  He should be prosecuted imo.

BTW, if anyone is interested in the pending civil suit, I took a look at some of the pleadings (which are public record).  The ""Fact"" section is incredibly short:

3.1  On January 25, 2015, Mr. Harper saw a woman crying in the street.  The woman indicated she had been punched in the face by Defendant Ha.

3.2  Mr. Haprer then instructed Defendant Ha to leave.  Mr. Harper told Defendant Ha not to hit women.

3.3  Defendant Ha stabbed Mr. Harper.

3.4  As a result of the stabbing, Mr. Harper suffered personal injuries and sustained special and general damages in an amount to be proven at trial.

Occam's razor. They're subtly racist in that societally accepted and white noiseish way that only white people really experience. A racial-deafness that is hardwired into you because you don't even realize the thoughts are racist. The journalists and casual observers here all assumed the ""other"" was at fault, and took the white boys story at face value, and didn't bother to dig further. It's racism.

I think I've spent about $1k on inspections alone including mold inspections, sewer inspections for everything that sounds good but has some kind of fatal flaw...It has been emotionally exhausting.


I think I know which West Seattle townhouse you are talking about. My agent literally told me to not go look at it unless I was willing to pay a lot more because it will get bid up. Every time I think something looks nice, I ask my agent what the pulse is before I go look at it. If she tells me there are pre-inspections or if it was red hot, I don't even bother going to the open house.

My strategy is to not get emotionally invested in anything but also to not buy a house unless the stars aligned and I was in love with it. It doesn't make any sense to buy a house just for the sake of buying a house. I feel like its kind of like getting married. I don't want to marry someone I'm not in love with but I also don't want to go crazy doing so.

"Seattle is one of the wealthiest cities in the world.   It's also completely unwilling to make a single sacrifice to help the homeless and addicted.  

It's a combination of the selfish wealthy and the teeming tens of thousands that come here to become wealthy, both groups are extremely antagonistic towards anything that isn't part of their path towards megamillions.  

Another factor is the puritanical streak embedded in American culture, an ingrained belief in punishing and being 'tough' on the immoral and ""lazy"".

The encampments are just DIRT with unheated porta potties and unheated washrooms.   Better faciliities are available at beach parks.   But the middle class of Seattle grit their teeth and write angry complaints that the lazy homeless are getting a free ride.

The rich are silent because they know they don't have to drum up support to hate and abandon the homeless.   

The increased development of ALL areas of Seattle is the only thing highlighting the homeless.

They've been here for decades.  But they were in the poor areas.   But the poor areas are disappearing, and it's very hard to be homeless in the suburbs.  So the homeless are becoming more and more of an eyesore to the wanna be rich filling up Seattle's newest bright spots.  

Since harassment of the homeless has been officially declared not legal, and there have been many exposes done on attempts to ship homeless to other cities, the old methods will have to be put away.   

Hopefully in a city of many intelligent people there will be a moment of clarity where they realize that if they want the unsightly homeless to be gone, they'll have to make them not homeless.

I can see where the business owner is coming from. Having tents out front hurts business and the city doesn't care, so it's them or us and we pay taxes and rent. If the city did care then why do they allow places like The Jungle exist for 15+ years?

I pay taxes so that people who think they can address this issue with their expertise are able to do so. Need more money? Raise my taxes. I'm happy to pay and contribute to civilization.

"You're getting a lot of kudos for the right intentions, which you deserve -  but sorry, effectively, you just gave a tweaker $20 for his drug habit and incentivized him to continue theft.

Just because you decided that the police probably would do nothing does not abdicate you from your responsibility to report crime.  You're right, they likely wouldn't be able to arrest the thief - but this information is invaluable in determining patterns of potential thieves, patterns of theft/resale, identifying people with open warrants, etc.  Who knows, maybe they just came back from filing a report on the same bike being stolen w/serial number?  Calling and reporting probable theft also filters down into reports about # of calls and locations of calls, which further drive allocation of police forces in the future.   This is especially important in the Fremont/Ballard area where this behavior has run amok lately.  

Please call, it's not too late, and you lose nothing - even if it ends up being a complete waste of time from your perspective.

Cons:

* The voice that announces the stations sounds like a sad woman in the middle of a stroke. Seriously, SDOT/ST? Did no one bother to listen to the voice before they made it live?

"The 542 runs every 15 min during rush hour, and I have never seen someone need to stand: there are always seats. If you want to shave a few minutes off your commute look to take any bus that goes from Green lake P&amp;R to Montlake interchange (looks like just the 48) and then use the OneBusAway app to race the 542 (on top of the bridge) vs the 545 (under the bridge) and take the first one that comes. It can save a few minutes if you get the 48 quickly and get straight off onto a 545, but the 542 will let you just sit and read a book without ever getting off at the cost of a few extra minutes.

As /u/pipeDreamSEA mentioned you can also bike to the Montlake interchange (all downhill in the AM) and lock your bike, a cheap bike with some nice locks, or put the bike on the 545, and off to Redmond. You can also take the MS bike shuttle (info available on the intranet) that picks up at Montlake market if you have a bike, there is no restriction for contractors for that service. Be aware that the 545 bike racks can fill in the summer and on nice days when more people decide to bike + bus. The bike shuttle pretty much always has space.

"&gt;Only in the last few years. Random violent crime was VERY rare.

Not to downplay this horrible attack, but actually it's just the opposite, violent crime has gone down consistently in Seattle since the mid 90's. What's putting people on edge is spending too much time on nextdoor.com, etc. 

Historical trends:
http://www.seattle.gov/spd/crime/12_stats/crime_1988_2012.pdf


&gt;• Among Major Crimes the Violent Crimes category consists of murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault.

&gt;• Over the past twenty-five years, reported Violent Crimes have shown a downward trend in Seattle. The trend was quite pronounced in the 1990s and has leveled off, but continued downward, since the beginning of the new millennium.

&gt;• The peak year for reported Violent Crimes in the period 1988-2012 was 1990 when 7,780 such crimes were reported in the City.

&gt;• The lowest year for reported

"&gt; But why is it every fucking time we see protests or riots about it, it's for some scumbag who got shot doing scummy things? 

Because in general, the police are mostly involved in those situations.  The issue has never been that cops are just rampantly killing innocents, the issue is that they're playing judge jury and executioner for crimes nowhere near justifying that level of force.

And honestly, I understand.  They deal with these scumbags all the time, and it creates an impression of society being overwhelmed by the scum, criminals, etc....

Someone I previously considered a good friend is an officer (not local) and in a recent discussion went into a 10-minute-long rant about how the ""bottom 20%"" was nothing but ""human waste"", a "" drain on society"", ""absolutely worthless sacks of shit"", etc.etc...  I get the impression this perspective is common among cops.  (And yes, that conversation made me rethink that friendship...  Hyperbole is one thing but damn...)

So you take a group of people, give them some considerable level of authority over the average citizen, then have them almost ONLY deal with the fuckups, thieves, murderers etc among us for a decade or two, and yeah, they're going to have some really fucked up perspectives.

So yeah, we've got a serious problem with American police.  And we're trying to fight it by cracking down... Which, to some extent, is a logical response - and given where we are now, its a course of action we pretty much have to take to quell violence in the short term.  But to really get to the root of the problem, police MUST be more engaged in society - not just enforcing the law, but actually seeing the positive, good outcomes and individuals.

I am fully supportive of the black lives matter movement; the changes they're requesting must happen.  But one thing I think they miss is, the problem isn't necessarily the individual cops (with some exceptions, of course) - the rampant, wide-reaching issue is a law enforcement system structured in a way that almost forces cops to lose faith in the societies they police.

Cycleshare is great for solving the ""last mile"" problem of connecting people from frequent transit to where they're going: why not double-down on that? Put a Pronto dock at each Link station entrance, and a dense swath of stations near homes and businesses within about a mile. Extend this reach a bit in areas with high-quality bike infrastructure (like the BG trail linking to UW station), as people will be willing to ride a little farther there.

This gives Pronto a purpose: improving access to high-capacity transit for people who wouldn't otherwise have it, and (by virtue of Link's geography) would also begin to address the equity issue. It also would be a *much* more effective use of funds than just expanding haphazardly into residential areas of, say, Maple Leaf.",,,,eruditeseattleite,,,1455977248,t5_2qhad,t3_46os1q,t3_46os1q,15,1458621847,0,0,d0714pt,Seattle,15,,

The nuances are fascinating, but the tl;dr is that non-competes tend to suppress workers' individual prospects and wages and reduce the entry of new/smaller firms into established industries. Established firms are the beneficiaries, although they do invest somewhat more in their employees.

&gt;Property crime elsewhere in the country dropped, but new FBI crime statistics show that Washington leapt from third in 2012 to first in 2013 thanks in part to a 6 percent jump in car thefts. The trend demands changes on the ground and in state sentencing policy.

&gt;The news probably is not a surprise to Seattle area residents. Property crime rates for the Seattle-Bellevue-Tacoma area are more than double rates in and around Boston, nearly one-third higher than the Denver metro area and more than a quarter higher than Portland and its suburbs.

"The bums have been given the right to trash our downtown, use the streets as their toilets and the pockets of tourists and locals as their ATM's.  They will not get ticketed for littering, exposing themselves, or harassment like the homeowners and tenants would.

They've been given the right to move their crappy little RV's into our neighborhoods where they don't get ticketed for the things the home owners and tenants will get ticketed or towed for.

Now the pinheads on the city council want to make the move permanent by putting actual structures in place so the lawlessness and squalor is distributed in neighborhoods in every part of the city.  They won't have to pay property taxes, and won't have to have structures that conform to housing codes.  One doubts they will be held to any standards on noise, trash or otherwise.

Everyone in Seattle seems to have rights except people who actually rent or own property and pay their rents/mortgages and property taxes on time.   There's something very wrong with that.

Part of my reason was that this is a house and I wanted to have both fiber and cable coming in so it would be easier to switch between companies depending on promo rates.

Pics of the install they did for me (using an inside-type fiber converter) and the asus router config page.  http://imgur.com/a/PZbZy

I hate to say it, but while I don't really see any worse speeds with CenturyLink (compared to the level I'm paying for), the customer service I had during the install process might even be a shade worse than comcast.

"I was lucky enough to be at the University of Washington when rent wasn't high, and when tuition wasn't expensive. I was making $12/hour @ 30 hours a week. I was able to: afford rent on NE 45th &amp; 8th, eat out on the ave, pay for school in cash, save a bit and graduate with no debt.

School was a bit over $5,500 a year. Rent was about $3,600 a year ($300 / month, for a 3 bedroom, 2 bathroom apartment utilities included). I had about $4k leftover after taxes. I also had a few grants which helped towards cost of living, and/or tuition.

Sadly, I don't see this as the case for newer students who have to be in an incredible amount of debt to not only afford *just* school, but to also live within a reasonable distance of school.

&gt;Fluharty asked about
realignment of State Highway 520 near the football stadium. Ihrig explained that the East Side interests envisioned a major transportation hub between buses and light rail, located near Husky Stadium, whereas UW is opposed to this. Traffic studies have been done, the Regents have publicly spoken against this early in the process, and local  communities have stated their opposition. He noted that Sound Transit can’t declare eminent domain, nor can UW, but the legislature theoretically could.",,,,shoeson,,,1455561140,t5_2qhad,t3_45xhff,t1_d00tnoi,12,1458516046,0,0,d00wf3n,Seattle,12,,

"Of course they are, you're nobody in 2016 America if you haven't found a way to claim you're being discriminated against. The degree to which these people are willing to defend the scum of the fucking universe based solely on the color of their skin cannot be interpreted as anything other than a racially divisive act. It's racial separatism, which is *literally* the same thing as racism, but they've got white people so terrified of being called ""racist"" that even the ""GOD HATES FAGS"" maniacs won't shout them down. There were almost 1,000 people shot an killed by the police in this country last year, and there were almost twice as many whites killed as blacks. More than a third of the unarmed police shooting victims were also white.


Now go down there and ask those protesters to name ONE white person, armed or otherwise, killed by the police in the last year. Hell, make it three years! Or for that matter, ask just about anyone you pass on the street. These people stand for nothing (no Donnie, these men are nihilists) other than the opportunity to scream and carry on and complain and disrupt.

"Keep in mind that much of the Housing First advocacy is based on some misunderstandings.

I'm a big supporter of the program, BUT many people misunderstand it's targets and effectiveness.

Housing first targets the chronically homeless(homeless for years over a significant part of their life) and is prioritized towards the disabled, chronically ill, or elderly.

Those targets are the recipients of a great deal of emergency medical care that end up as a loss to any medical program.  So it's money already coming out of state and county budgets.   Improving their environment and introducing lower cost chronic care as opposed to emergency care is speculated to save a great deal in terms of medical care.

These same savings would not be seen housing a reasonably healthy 20-40 year old.

In the end, it's  a win win program because it targets the more vulnerable and those using more emergency medical care.

One of the flaws is that the program is not designed to target the general homeless population.  Most specifically the aggressive and healthy males that tend to engage in illegal activities that are often of most concern to the general public.
