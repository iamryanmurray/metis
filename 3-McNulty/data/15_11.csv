The fact that the League of Women Voters were also against it offered me some cover.

"Hey guys, so I was apart of this protest. We gathered together to show solidarity with what is currently happening at Mizzou and other colleges in Missouri. Black students are receiving death threats at these campus because they stood up for their rights. They are standing up for their rights to go to school, to feel welcomed at those school, and for their needs to be put at the same level of the white students on campus. I understand that this protest inconvenienced and lot of people. I understand that the organizers of the protest did get the proper permits to march down a busy public street. I also believe that sometimes, in order for the needs of the oppressed to be heard, and for protests like this to be seen, people are going to be inconvenienced. If we hadn't marched up 15th and blocked the intersection with 45th, would you have heard about the protest at all? Sometimes in order to be heard you have to do things to interrupt the daily lives of those around you. You have to give them something to really think about. If Martin Luther King Jr. and other leaders of the Civil Rights Movement hadn't done things to interrupt the daily lives of people, and held protests of all kinds in public spaces that are used by everyday people, nothing would have happened. If the Black athletes on the Mizzou football team didn't decide to boycott playing, if they hadn't had found away to inconvenience the administration at their school, nobody would have heard about what was going on at Mizzou, and their President would never have addressed their grievances.

I am saying this as a white 21 year old male. I am the standard of what the education system of America caters to. I could have easily just gone about my day. I didn't have to go to this protest. I went because it pains me to see and hear the struggles that Black people go through on a daily basis to just EXIST in our society. Most people in Seattle (including me up until the summer after my freshman year at UW) believe that this is something that has already been fought over. People point to the Civil Rights Movement and say,""Look!! We've already taken care of this problem."" What they CRM dealt with what blatant racism. It is true that you can no longer find restaurants with white only signs. But it is also true that the institutions of our society are still designed to keep people of color, especially Black Americans, out of the education system, out of government, and even out of the everyday life of society. The school to prison pipeline is real people. It is a racist system that has been built to remove people from society, and most of those people are Black. 

I know some of these opinions may be unpopular, but I hope and I pray that people will be receptive to what I say, and that people will read what I say and think about it. If there isn't a problem of systemic racism in our country, in our state, in our county, and in our city, then why have people been fighting to be heard for over a year now. If this was not real, if this was not worth fighting for, if this was not worth giving ones time, ones life for, wouldn't people have realized that by now? its not an over reaction if that reaction is needed in order to been seen and to be heard.

"Yes, the [FHWA guidelines](http://www.ops.fhwa.dot.gov/freewaymgmt/hovguidance/) state:

&gt; ***Facility degradation is defined in Section 166(d)(2) as one that does not meet minimum average operating speed of 45 MPH for 90 percent of the time over a 180-day monitoring period*** during morning and evening weekday peak hours (or both), in the case of a HOV facility with a speed limit of 50 MPH or greater, or not more than 10 MPH below the speed limit in the case of a facility with a speed limit of less than 50 MPH.

&gt; To avoid the need for potential corrective action, States are encouraged to work with their local FHWA Division Office before allowing SOV/LOV, HOT or low emission and energy-efficient vehicles (i.e., hybrid vehicles) to use HOV facilities. More information on the certification requirements can be found in Chapter IV.

&gt; Beginning with MAP-21, Sections 166(d)(D) and (E) were adopted. Section (d)(D) prescribes that the State has 180 days following notice of degradation to ""bring the facility into compliance with the minimum average operating speed performance standard through changes to operation of the facility, including"" (1) ***increasing the occupancy requirement for HOV lanes;*** (2) ***varying the toll charged to vehicles under subsection*** (b); (3) discontinuing allowing non-HOV vehicles to use the HOV lanes under subsection (b); or, (4) increasing the available capacity of the HOV facility. Section (d)(E) prescribes penalty, such that if the state fails to bring a facility into compliance under (D), then the Secretary shall subject the State to appropriate program sanctions under Section 1.36 of Title 23 (or successor) until the performance is no longer degraded. For the record, that section reads as follows: ***If the Administrator determines that a State has violated or failed to comply with the Federal laws or the regulations in this part with respect to a project, he may withhold payment to the State of Federal funds on account of such project***, withhold approval of further projects in the State, and take such other action that he deems appropriate under the circumstances, until compliance or remedial action has been accomplished by the State to the satisfaction of the Administrator.",,,,subtlefarts,West Seattle,,1447954781,t5_2qhad,t3_3tgcxo,t1_cx5vih1,48,1449898814,0,0,cx5wini,Seattle,48,,flair

"People most often get the negative reaction to these requests when they just toss their question off with less than 50 words of effort.  

Looking at your post, you asked for Thai restaurant suggestions.  That's great.  I am sure lots of folks have favorite Thai restaurants to suggest.  I am partial to Tangerine Thai but my reasons are hyper-localized to me in that it is about a 5 minute walk from my house.  Maybe it isn't that great from a tourist/visitor/thai food enthusiast perspective.  I recommend their Gaeng Garee curry though.

But when you just say you want to see what's cool and not to be missed...that is terribly subjective.  

The things that I think are cool and not to be missed are likely not the same as they are for you.  I would say that visiting Fisheries Supply and SeaMar are ""not to be missed"" because they are world class chandleries, and that's the type of thing I seek out when visiting another city with a maritime history and culture.  

Maybe you are into gaming in which case I would say Card Kingdom is not to be missed.  Maybe.  Who knows?

&gt; It takes anywhere from 18–24 months for a Syrian refugee to be cleared to live in the United States. First he or she must be registered with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. This agency interviews refugees, conducts background checks, takes their biometric data, and establishes whether they belong to one of roughly 45 “categories of concern” given their past lives and work history in Syria. Typically, the applicants are women and children. If anything looks amiss, they are pulled from consideration. Then the U.S. government begins its own vetting. The applicants are interviewed again, and their names and particulars are run through terrorism databases. They receive additional screening when they arrive in the United States and then again after their first year in the country. This process has led to slightly more than 1,800 Syrians being admitted to the United States since 2011.

"It's sadly true.  

It largely has to do with the fact that FC Dallas are a ""Dallas team"" in name only.  They play their games in a suburb 45 minutes away from Dallas proper...which requires taking a toll road and is not accessible via public transit...and make virtually zero effort to market their games to anyone in actual Dallas, instead focusing on the affluent suburbs that surround them.  Hell, they barely market themselves at all...they have, arguably, the best team in the area and no one knows it.  Annnnd, I believe they just signed on to continue their exile in that far-flung suburb for a long, long time...instead of moving closer to the city with public transit access (like everyone else has been doing).  

Point out and question any of these facts to any member of FCD's front office or one of their numerous relatively-tiny, fragmented supporters groups and they pee their pants about how you're a ""bad supporter"" and ""what's wrong with our fan base"".  I literally had a prominent member of FCD's front office tell me that when I was still considering a season ticket package. Thus, I no longer support FCD.

At this point, I honestly believe that, if the NASL somehow managed to drop a team near Downtown Dallas, they would eventually overtake FC Dallas in local support.

"If setup properly a few of these buses could operate a route with very little driver layover and very frequent service. Something like 4 drivers on route, one on break. As the person on break babysits the charging buses the other drivers come, grab a fully charged bus and leave the other bus to charge. In a scenario like this the small group of buses could operate 24x7 with almost no breaks in service. No need to return to base for fueling, the only time a bus would need to return would be for maint. 

These will never replace all of the metro fleet, but in this area electricity usually beats diesel for price and consistency, not to mention the environmental impacts of using electricity (around here largely hydro produced) over petroleum fuels. 

23 miles may not seem like much but as others have said it would cover a lot of the metro routes, also this is early tech, the batteries can be swapped for others that have greater capacity (also likely charge slower, and cost more).

Before posting this shit go and read up [on it a bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_banking_and_finance#Mur.C3.A2ba.E1.B8.A5ah). The gist is that instead of getting a phat mortgage then paying off the principal plus interest, you bundle the whole cost together from the get-go and ""rent"" the property for a fixed amount and fixed period of time, after which you own it. I'll call it WYSIWYG lending, because the price you see is the amount you pay.

"It's hard for me, coming from Texas. I'm adjusting to the people here - completely opposite in every way. This is just my perspective so please hear me out - Texan's are not known for their wits, but we are very friendly, accommodating, and helpful. It's easy to make friends in Texas because everyone has a cool story who they are and where they come from, and people are interested in getting to know you. People are genuinely curious about you and your background, and will ask about it while meeting you to become your friend. In Seattle, people here are very educated, and don't follow traditions. Many of the people I've met are really cool. But the problem is, they seem too cool to talk to me. There is an attitude here that people seem to have - ""I already have enough friends, why should I get to know you, you're not special"". No one takes the time to sit down and get to know each other. I get the feeling that people assume that everyone is the same, and no one can impress or surprise them. It's almost like people are bored of meeting people in Seattle while in Texas meeting people and making friends is very exciting.

However, just because that's the way it is, doesn't mean that that's ""right"" or ""correct"". I.e. if you ask *most* people if they want less taxes, they'll of course say yes.

A rising tide does indeed raise all boats but for the poor they don't have a boat and will simply drown. No matter what the minimum wage is anyone who only makes minimum wage will be a poor person. Raise the wage to $100/hr and all you've done is raise the price of beer to $60 a pint and made people who earn $100/hr poor.

I understand the incentive to vote yes on more money in your pocket but what the poor really need is more spending power, not more money. Also the poor will want a job at all and Seattle just shed a thousand food workers.

"&gt; My main huge issue with Amazon is how heavily they import new hires domestically and internationally who have no real knowledge, love or respect for Seattle culture, economics or anything really unique - and these people also tend to not bring anything culturally unique with them beyond their IT skill set, which these days isn't nearly as interesting or unique as the very early days of the consumer internet.

This is a terrible thing to say and just plain wrong.

Just because someone isn't from this part of the country (or even from this country at all) doesn't mean they don't bring their own unique culture, passions, activities.

"&gt; A vote of 2/3 of the city council and all of the money can be used to build a giant statue of Sarah Palin in Pioneer Square. 

You know, you keep trying this on Seattle Transit Blog and it doesn't work any better there.  First, why do you think the people who are elected to run this city will end their political futures by pissing off the voters that badly?  (I choose to substitute ""pay for the entirety of Bertha"" for your hyperbolic example since mine is a little more plausible though no more likely.)  Second, as /u/ChefJoe98136 has already corrected you on, the actual text of the levy specifies a **3/4ths** majority to change any more than *10%* of funds allocations.

&gt; If we are being asked the invest that kind of money, having a list that we can hold our elected officials to is important. It was good enough for the Parks levy and the School construction levy. Hell, even Sound Transit gives you a commitment list. 

Three responses to that: 1) Why should our elected officials be hamstrung by a list of projects that, by the end of the levy period, may be out of date?  What if Lake City suddenly explodes in popularity and there's more of a need there than, say, Bitter Lake?  Why not let them have that freedom versus the millions of editorials the *Seattle Times* will inevitably run saying how poorly managed the Move Seattle levy was implemented?

B) Parks and schools are different because it's highly unlikely that massive population changes will affect where we plant those.  Schools can be adjusted by changing their attendance zones; parks are, well, parks and there's no particular *need* for them to be in any specific spot for them to be useful.

Third, Sound Transit also gives a list of suggestions.  Their board can and absolutely does suspend and change projects as the need arises.  You may have noticed that we're just now seeing the Angle Lake extension to Central Link.  That was supposed to have been completed in the first round back in 2008-2010 but the Sound Transit board had the authority to suspend it because of financial considerations.  There's no Graham Street station because the board deemed it not worth the cost relative to the usage patterns being seen on Link.  Sound Transit Express route 578 sprang into existence because Pierce Transit cut that route so ST added it back for access to a Sounder station.  When Sound Transit 2 passed, ST 512 didn't exist in its current form; it's been wholesale modified *twice*.

"&gt;Just going out on a casual date is easily $100

That's because you don't value frugality. 

I make about 34k gross, work for the state so I have good affordable benefits. I live with my SO and room mates in a house, 4 bedroom 3 bath. I have never paid more than $560/month for rent, been living in Seattle since 2004. 

When it comes to getting rentals you have to be a shark. We're on a second year at this nice place, next to major bus routes and two blocks from grocery. We do limit our rental search to be within good bus lines and grocery shopping. And we've been getting to know the lay of the land over time. 

We don't keep a car. We do have cats. 

My friends and I hang out and, smoke pot, play games, drink some, maybe craft something. 

We have a lot of friends who are creative types so there will be shows, performances and events to attend through out the year. Plus b-day celebrations and holiday parties. [This year we did pumpkin carving and I grew my own pumpkin]

A couple times a month my SO and I will play a small game at a bar and each drink a flight; or get 1/2 liter German/Belgian beers. We're pretty good cooks so we don't easily pay someone else to make something we can make at home. 

Ever since the recession I have not kept a data plan. I'm sticking to my guns about only wanting to pay for one personal access point to the internet. With a 40hr desk job I'm surrounded by a lot of internet access. And eventually along weekly commute lines you might find free wifi while at a bus stop in front of a bar. You remember these kinds of locations. 

Weeknights we like to share a beer, listen to a podcast while cooking dinner, then watch TV and eat. Earlier last month I got five different pumpkin beers for us to casually drink while cooking. We like to explore beer at home. Tonight we made our own Thai basil green beans with beef using home grown bell peppers. We've been keeping the last of ours out on the vine but the plants are now totally succumbing to fungus. November bell peppers in Seattle! 

Weekends in the summer might involve gardening, home cooked brunch, popping over to an annual event (Folklife, Solstice, the Light Parade thing, we're liking the cider festival craze, annual car camping trip). Warm weather is nice if you go far from home in the city and it takes a while to get back by bus, it is nice to be out on a warm night. 

Weekends in the winter are spent a bit more indoors. No snow sports. Having a love hate relationship with a spacious house, vaulted ceilings are a lot to heat. 


If I had an extra 1k/month? Camping or PDX/Vancouver trips, a few Broadway shows, maybe more home crafting/DIY. We'd probably have more power tools. More expensive weed or marijuana products. 

**edit** also went to the UW when it was a lot cheaper, it was something like 6k tuition for an entire year. I was a poster-child for financial aid and graduated with 14k in debt in 2007 that has since been squashed. College and Cafe culture really helped me establish a good network of friends that has made communal living pretty enjoyable.

"Renting a car is your best bet, from one of the big brands like Enterprise, Hertz, Avis, Budget, etc.

Right now is off-season, with the exceptions being Thanksgiving week and about a week and a half prior to Christmas, leading up to it. From then on out, all the way until March is plain down season for the rental/travel industry, and instead of having price wars to the top, they have price wars to the bottom.

Don't rent from the airport. It's about 40% higher than renting downtown.

Renting *out* of downtown is even cheaper. Neighborhood rental offices in Shoreline, Tacoma, Federal Way, Kent, etc., don't spike their prices. Downtown offices do. Why? Because people are still willing to pay a few extra dollars more for the convenience. 

HOWEVER!! If you rent, be aware that offroading of any sort (yes, even going so much as on a gravel private road) voids a lot of the insurances that you can accept at the counter; so double check with your own insurance company, as well as your credit card company, what kinds of rental insurances and disclaimers are provided.

Using a debit card? Be aware that most companies check your credit score, and sometimes even with good credit, the system is never reliable, so use a major credit card if you've got one.

The fact that you are so casually willing to pass that burden on to a random stranger so you can feel good about raising awareness is vile.

The best part?  You care so much about this cause that you had to create a throwaway account to post it.

So why should votes to lower taxes get held to a lesser standard than votes to raise taxes?  If we need to keep tax revenue the same for all time, shouldn't both of them be subject to a 2/3rds vote?  What about inflation?  Is bringing in the same amount of purchasing power a tax increase or is that keeping it level?  What if a tax source shrinks--say, the sales tax due to an economic recession or increasing fuel economy lowers fuel sales and, thus, gas tax receipts--does finding the same amount of money elsewhere count as an increase, stabilization, or a decrease?

"As a Seattle area transportation engineer I can chime in.  There are several types of trips people make.  Modeling when and where these will occur is all part of transportation forecasting.  

In the morning, a large portion of trips generated are work related.  However, in the afternoon, there are additional trips generated that are non-work related.  Some of these include shopping, personal business, going out to dinner, etc etc.  So now you have people commuting home AND people driving for other purposes.

"I've come to believe that Eyman doesn't really even care about the outcome of his initiatives.  They've served their real purpose--earning him a nice income as their promoter--long before the elections finally happen, or the courts get around to throwing them out.

In fact, I wonder if he doesn't deliberately keep putting out flawed initiatives that he knows will be invalidated by the courts, because it's job security.  Every time that happens, he gets to whip his followers into a rage over activist judges and elected officials ignoring the will of the people--and then he gets to propose another version of the same initiative.  This was, what, the third or fourth time he's pushed one requiring a supermajority vote of the legislature to raise any state taxes and fees?  The courts have invalidated the first three, and it's widely thought they're likely to smack this one down, too, [for the same reasons as always](http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2015/nov/05/editorial-court-should-quickly-decide-i-1366/).  If he'd been proposing things that were actually well-designed and constitutional, he would have run out of new crackpot ideas a long time ago.

He has some major donors who've been giving him serious money for years, and a whole lot of faithful smaller ones.

"&gt;I've been taking King Country Metro buses for years. Last week I took a Sound Transit bus for the first time. My first impression was ""wow"", it feels so much nicer - better seats, armrests, luggage racks, it felt more like a train than a bus.

&gt;Why the huge disparity in buses?

My impression is they know Seattle city riders will ride regardless, so they buy the nice buses for suburban commuters, as part of an attempt to bribe them out of their cars.


The irony of all this is if we ever get to enough ridership from suburbia that this is no longer needed, we'll probably quit buying super-nice suburban buses and stick everyone on the utilitarian-style Seattle city buses.

So enjoy it, suburban 1-way commuters. 

Meanwhile Seattle ridership helps subsidize all of it.

"Lol. I have tried and tried to explain to the NIMBYs of Ballard how supply and demand works in commercial real estate, especially when they start to complain about housing affordability. Build enough units and it will affect prices every time, it doesn't matter if the new units are luxury because there is only a finite number of Seattlites who can afford luxury rents. Theoretically every landlord would want to charge the most rent no matter the building condition so why don't they? Because of supply and demand. A landlord could charge a million dollars a month but if no one will pay it he's forced to sit vacant or lower the price. High vacancies cost landlords money as they have to pay for operations (tax, insurance, maintenance, etc) with less revenue and the vacancy will manifest itself as a higher cap rate ""value add"" story when trying to sell the property, hurting the value. If too many luxury units open in a market that doesn't have as many people that are willing to pay that rent they will be forced to lower rates or likely what you'll see is a signing incentive, 1-2 months free, etc so they can put the full rental rate on the rent roll and later on try to obtain permanent financing or sell the project. And when you have a large scale building that is empty you know that developer is getting hammered on his high interest construction loan really motivating him to lease up with the short term maturity.

When it comes to commercial real estate, multifamily properties are the most reactive to market conditions than other asset classes (office, industrial, retail) because there are more leases that encompass smaller spaces in the building and have faster turnover. So in other words, if the market overheats you will see rents go down quickly rather than in an office building where there might be 4 years left on the lease.",,,,TXinSeattle321,,,1448344351,t5_2qhad,t3_3u11um,t1_cxb120u,10,1449988840,0,0,cxb4djo,Seattle,10,,

There are some significant interaction between heroin and legal medicines that a doctor has to be concerned with.

Do NOT use the drive-thru! Go inside the restaurant to eat. You will need the break from driving. The time you save by eating on the road isn't worth the rest from driving that you will get.

"People grossly overestimate the importance of bright clothing and reflectors for cyclists, but the truth is they only work when you're directly in the headlights of a car, while most car/bike crashes are turning conflicts where the bike is only in the driver's headlights moments before impact.  Good, bright lighting is far more important than bright clothing or reflectors.  (Especially when so many drivers don't turn on their headlights in the rain.)

That said, the Basic Rule says drivers are supposed to keep their speed low enough to avoid other legal road users.  Yes, you really are supposed to drive slowly enough to see and avoid pedestrians in unmarked crosswalks wearing all black clothing, or cyclists with just a red rear reflector and a dim headlight.  Sometimes that means it's only legal to drive 20 or 25 mph in a 35 mph zone if visibility is bad; sometimes it means you have to crawl along at a brisk walk in heavy fog.  

Too many drivers mistake the speed limit for a target rather than a maximum speed in clear daylight conditions.

"Oddly, the happiest election result for me is that this muppet named Scott Henden is losing in a school district director election over in Kitsap. At this moment, I feel like karma is a real thing and all those virtual downvotes that Henden had accumulated in his life of being a ripe bastard to everyone have finally been counted by the universe's slow and buggy karma servers.

He didn't do anything to me, personally, but blackening that box next to his opponent's name did feel a little personal. Henden, a clownshoes electrician with no college degree, had what seemed like 10 times the budget of his opponent, who is some old dude who only spent his entire life and career in the area as a schoolteacher. 

Only with elections involving school positions do you get that weird thing where voters think any uneducated moron can do the job, even though the job specifically is about education. It would be ridiculous for other positions, like, ""Hi I'm Jimothy from Jimothy's Plumbing and Septic and I'd like you to elect me as Hogg County Coroner.""

Seeing Henden's name on giant signs when he first ran for school board, 4 years ago, gave me tingles in my spine. It was a deep, lizard-brain reaction of repulsion with no conscious memory of why, like my own mind is protecting me from reliving a traumatic event. It's like seeing Pinhead from the Hellraiser movies put on a smile, try to kiss a few babies without drawing too much blood, and run for mayor. ""Vote Pinhead,"" people would say, ""Sure he's a demon who is known for his multiple killing sprees and damning mortal souls, but he has some great ideas! He was the 'Pope of Hell', you know, so he has lots of real-world leadership experience.""

Then Pinhead's opponents would be like, ""He just murdered the debate moderator and half of the people in the town hall with a...""

""Can't this be a campaign of *issues* and not mudslinging?"" Pinhead's supporters would interrupt.

""But Candidate Pinhead is actively ripping my limbs off *right now*.""

""Oh, so you have some kind of personal grudge? You should listen to what he has to say about budget reform and see if you can get over your petty biases based on these personal anecdotes. Pinhead has an excellent 12-pin plan to revitalize the... Will please stop bleeding on me?""

However, I've got to give it to that rapscallion, Henden, because he surely had to do some rigorous preparation for this election, which I do respect. He probably had to hire and train some people to clear away any flowers that would wither and blacken in his presence, as well as to catch any birds that might drop dead and fall out of the sky. Gotta carry lighting rigs everywhere in case the sun should suddenly go dark, the moon turn red, and ashes fill the air while an old lady starts yelling about that damn prophecy again. The hardest thing of all certainly had to be Henden stopping himself from the habit of twirling his mustache and cackling. I hear that he had to limit himself to tying just one kidnapped damsel to railroad tracks this year.

Sheesh, that felt good to get out. Sorry, It's 2 AM, I've got the flu, and I've been holding in my full opinion on Scott Henden this past month so as not to be accused of shilling for the other guy or something. Plus, he strikes me as exactly the kind of cheeselog who sues people for libel if they so much as give his business a 2 star rating on Yelp.",,,,CurlSagan,,,1446631846,t5_2qhad,t3_3rffk3,t3_3rffk3,17,1449589589,0,0,cwnzqvr,Seattle,17,,

I would describe it as ""not a ton of fun"".  We haven't had a night to ourselves since we moved here.  But it's not a disaster either.  We're on a five year-plan to make things better.  Her work has strongly suggested that she'll be promoted next year for an extra $4/hr, and my pay doubles over the next four years (apprenticeship).  And we can manage for now.

Our situation is a bit unique though.  I'm not related to the kid so the state considers my girlfriend to be a single mother and the father has been a complete deadbeat since day one so we get a lot of taxpayer help with the kid.  If I was actually the little guy's dad we'd be hosed.  Then we'd have to pay full price for daycare.  We couldn't possibly afford an extra $1000 a month in expenses.  Not even on a ramen diet.

"&gt;What if we start making it easier not to have children

It is already much easier to not have children. It's cheaper, and takes up none of your time. 

&gt; So what I would specifically like to see is a world that makes it difficult to have children.

It already is. Do you have any idea how much it costs, in both time and money, to have and raise children? 

&gt;  I would like tax credits/deductions for children and single residence houses removed.

People don't have kids in order to get tax credits. And if you did this, you'd just be taxing the people who need money the most. 

The final thing I'll add, with regards to your overpopulation theory, is that in most first world countries, the population is *declining*. The United States is an anomaly in that regard, but that's only because we are taking in so many immigrants that our population is still increasing. 

So what does cause people to have more children? It's strongly correlated to lack of education and lack of financial resources. That's why, tragically, the countries that are the poorest and have the least resources are growing the fastest. So if you want to crusade against overpopulation that's fine, but address the true cause.

No.  The King County court that initially ruled on this said that the authority to amend the state constitution rests solely with the legislature.  The initiative process can (and has, see the marijuana legalization bill that imposed new taxes) modify, remove, or add taxes.

"If you lived in Nazi germany and people started protesting the concentration camps would you be complaining that they're blocking access to the hospital and therefore you have no respect for their movement?

The idea that any critical service might be impacted by a protest, including medical care, is not something that should determine the validity of a protest. In fact, interrupting people's lives in serious ways is usually the point of a protest.

Anyone who repeats this talking point about ambulances being blocked by protestors is truly on their way to supporting a fascist empire entirely like the Nazis.

Somehow we should overlook the longest wars in American history that are taking place, where hundreds of thousands have been killed and millions displaced, yet the idea that one or two people MIGHT be delayed 5 minutes because an ambulance has to go down another block is a critical talking point?

No. Stop and think about that again. We are literally killing hundreds of people every day around the world in illegal wars and all anyone wants to bring up when people protest is that ""they didn't have a message"" or ""they weren't in a free speech zone"" or ""they didn't get the right permits.""

The idea that permits are issued to exercise constitutional rights is absurd. The right to protest is in the bill of rights and it doesn't say ""a well regulated citizenry"" like it does in the second amendment. There is no justification for being cowed to believing that a government must permit those who would speak ill of it.

Stupidity, sheer stupidity. **I truly can't believe how anyone can think its wrong to possibly block an ambulance when you're protesting a government that is torturing, spying, killing, and selling out its own citizens every single day. The amount of harm our government does to the American people in 1 day is much higher than a hypothetical about an ambulance just happening to need to use that intersection while it just happens to have a patient in it who absolutely would suffer by waiting 5 minutes for them to go around. ITS RIDICULOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1**

This is nothing more than an appeal to the simplest people in our society who can't understand that the government is committing atrocities every day and we're standing here arguing about bullshit the protestors did which didn't even happen!

Edit: And here come the downvotes, and of course with no reasoning.. just the typical corporate media talking points being repeated with no critical thinking. You make me sick.

" Preliminary Report - Highway - HWY15MH011
Executive Summary

​The information in this report is preliminary and will be supplemented or corrected during the course of the investigation.

 
About 11:11 a.m. local time on Thursday, September 24, 2015, a 2009 MCI motorcoach, operated by CWA Inc. DBA Bellair Charters Hesselgrave South, was traveling southbound in the center lane on the Washington State Route 99 (SR99) Aurora Bridge (official name: George Washington Bridge). The motorcoach was occupied by a 68-year-old driver and 50 passengers. At the same time, a 1945 DUKWan amphibious military vehicle modified for tour operations, operated by Ride The Ducks Seattle LLC, and occupied by a 54-year-old driver and 36 passengerswas traveling northbound in the center lane on the SR99 Aurora Bridge. As the two vehicles approached each other, the DUKW driver reported hearing a loud “bang” as his vehicle experienced a mechanical failure at the left front axle assembly, causing him to lose control. The DUKW vehicle crossed the center line into the oncoming traffic in the southbound lanes. The front of the DUKW struck the left side of the motorcoach near the driver’s compartment. The DUKW vehicle then penetrated into the left side passenger compartment of the motorcoach, damaging the interior floor and occupied seats. During the impact, the DUKW rolled toward its left side and a number of passengers were ejected before the vehicle came to rest back on its wheels.

A 2011 Dodge Ram pickup truck was also traveling southbound adjacent to the motorcoach. In an attempt to avoid the collision, the Dodge pickup truck moved left into the northbound lane and subsequently struck the right side of the DUKW. The Dodge pickup truck continued forward, striking a 2006 Toyota Highlander sport utility vehicle, which had been traveling in the northbound left lane behind the DUKW and had struck the left side of the DUKW. A 2007 Toyota Tundra pickup truck, also traveling in the northbound lane, struck the left front of the Dodge pickup truck.
 
As a result of this crash, five occupants of the motorcoach died. Sixty-two occupants of the motorcoach, the DUKW, and the crash-involved passenger vehicles reported injuries ranging from minor to serious.
 
An axle housing modification described in an October 2013 notice issued by Ride The Ducks International, which refurbishes and modifies DUKW amphibious vehicles into passenger-carrying tour vehicles for commercial use, is being reviewed as part of the investigation. The stated purpose of the notice was to alert owners and provide guidance on a modification to strengthen the DUKW axle housing to prevent fractures. The left front axle assembly that failed on the accident vehicle had an earlier modification to the axle housing that had been recommended by Ride The Ducks International but did not have an associated service bulletin.

 
NTSB investigators documented the damage to the crash scene, the DUKW vehicle, and the motorcoach using three-dimensional (3D) laser scanning technology. Figures 1 and 2 show the 3D scans of the left front side of the DUKW vehicle and the left side of the motorcoach, respectively.

"&gt; How about just loosening regulations to encourage competition

We've actually done that. The city council [amended the director's rule](http://www.geekwire.com/2014/seattle-approves-bill-allows-fiber-network-deployment/) which had been preventing fiber cabinets from being installed, it passed unanimously Sawant included.

The council also voted to [eliminate cable franchise districts](http://www.geekwire.com/2015/seattle-city-council-approves-legislation-that-eliminates-cable-tv-franchise-districts/), again unanimously. CenturyLink has begun testing out PrismTV in some areas as a result.

Private ISPs are not interested in providing everyone with service, they're interested in making money, which is understandable. I actually contacted CenturyLink's gigabit sales department for Seattle and was told flat out that even though they were planning on deploying to my area, they were not interested in connecting my apartment because they didn't want to spend the money to also run Cat5e cables to each unit. 

Given that each private entity's network is closed to competition, it's hard to rationalize the capital costs of building an overlapping redundant network to an area already served by an incumbent, so it doesn't happen much.

"&gt; The levy as proposed is for a decade worth of funding, and is property tax funded, if this holy grail succeeds won't it hamstring future transit focused funding ( like ST3 etc ).

No.  The total property tax levy for senior taxing districts--the state itself, code cities--is $3.60 per $1,000 of assessed value.  Junior districts--in general, anything but the state or city, such as a library district, school district, fire district, regional transit area district, and so on--may levy another $5.90 per $1,000 for a total of $9.50 per $1,000.  There is a $0.50/$1k ""reserve"" by law.

""But wait, somenewuser, Seattle's currently levying $9.27/$1k and some cities, like Federal Way, levy $14.20/$1k and that's way above the $10/$1k limit you just said!  Doesn't this mean you are full of shit and no one should believe a word you just wrote?!""

Nope.  The law allows for levy lid lifts, where the voters say ""that's cool, we want to pay for what you've proposed so we're OK with letting you go higher.""  The reason some cities can go above $10/$1k is complicated.  But, suffice to say, Seattle has been around long enough and has enough ""banked"" property tax authority--inclusive of what it can ask the voters to grant through levy lifts--that we're not bumping up against the limit any time soon, even with Sound Transit 3.

&gt; What's in it for district 1? ...there is nothing west seattle focused in this levy.

Well, this [here PDF map of proposals for district 1](http://www.seattle.gov/transportation/docs/LevyDistrict1.pdf) begs to disagree with you.  The Delridge Way pedestrian bridge, Andover pedestrian bridge, and Admiral Way bridges all get built or updated.  There's a pile of sidewalk and drainage work, corridor paving, transit corridor updates on Delridge and Fauntleroy, ""Safe Route to School"" programs that benefit more than just school children, and so on.

You're looking for big showboat projects and, yes, there aren't many.

"I'm not your cyclist, but I have been that cyclist.

I would love a lot of fancy reflective rain gear, but it is expensive. So I'm often left with what street clothes I can get from thrift stores. And since I'm a barista dirt bag who plays and commutes in the mud and rain all year around, my favorite color is black, and not because it is slimmming.

So I put a lot of retro reflective tape on my bike and I use very bright lights, including a headlamp.

And - don't take this personally - I don't ever, ever trust anything with four wheels whether it's piloted or moving or not. I promise you that I see you. I know exactly where you are just as much as an antelope knows where the cheetah is, because cars = fast scary death monsters.

Because, frankly, on an average commute in a big city I would almost get hit a dozen times a day if I didn't ride a little bit like a paranoid, skittish ninja antelope getting chased by a cheetah.

So, be careful. Slow down. You'll see more. And not every cyclist can afford nice gear. Sometimes they're just trying to get to work and pay rent.

And take a breath and relax a little. Almost every urban cyclist knows what the risks are. Most of us have come to terms with concepts like death or getting mangled up by someone's poor dumb, heavy metal box on wheels.

And we usually know when it isn't really your fault, and we don't hold it against you.

"You're not going to find a neighborhood full of Cubans here, for starters.  There are some areas that have more Latinos than others but just understand that the Latino culture you see in South Florida is nonexistent here.  

And if the exact location/neighborhood/amenities don't matter all that much, you just want to get here and out of Florida, I'd look at places that are not the Seattle or Portland.  Start by checking out Tacoma or Tigard, or Bellingham, Olympia, Vancouver (WA), etc.  Because if you try to move here and survive on the salaries of a dog groomer and graphic artist, you might struggle a bit (not that there's anything wrong with those professions, they just don't tend to pay a lot and it's an expensive area).

It's that putting third world-style shantytowns in residential neighborhoods is simply not acceptable. And it's that a city that purports to be progressive and world-class needs to do better than this, both for homeless people and neighborhoods. Tent cities are not a solution.

"I think most people in Seattle get that, and are okay with it.

It's actually a very small government type solution to the working poor. People, especially those with kids, working minimum wage are going to be on welfare anyway. It actually cuts the welfare state out of the loop by just paying them directly and forgoing the benefits bureaucracy. Plus it incentives work, especially for single mothers. Either way, it's coming out of the pocket of consumers in general, might as well shrink the state.

Milton Friedman, although opposed to a minimum wage, even suggested that a Guaranteed Minimum Income should be established for just this reason. If Milton Friedman and Kshama Sawant can get together on a basic idea, then I'd say it's worth looking at.

"""Our entire agenda legislative agenda is to make Obama a one term president""

Remember that?

Or how about the still in place house rule that if a majority of *Republicans* don't support a bill it doesn't get a vote. Telling the Dems their votes don't count isn't divisive at all, no.

Oh and the bus quote, here have the context:
""Finally we got this car up on level ground. And, yes, it's a little beat up. It needs to go to the body shop. It's got some dents; it needs a tune-up. But it's pointing in the right direction. And now we've got the Republicans tapping us on the shoulder, saying, we want the keys back.

You can't have the keys back. You don't know how to drive. You can ride with us if you want, but you got to sit in the backseat. We're going to put middle-class America in the front seat. We're looking out for them.""

The other quote is fairer. But given he was talking about immigration, which attracts a huge number of racist assholes, I don't see that as starting the division.

I've had dozens of people offer me donations of clothes, blankets, cash, or food, and only about 2% of them ever come to fruition. Most people make an offer to help, then just totally ignore any further messages I send to them. Some have even deleted their public offers to lend a hand, and even delete their accounts, making me think I was being trolled the entire time. I've spent my last pocket change on bus rides to places like Northgate and Mountlake Terrace, only to be stood up and stuck in unfamiliar territories outside all night. This is why I recently posted asking people to stop offering help, because I just cannot afford getting stranded, or getting my hopes up just to have them dashed.

Socks will be really helpful and I would suggest making those you priority, Costco sells decent ones at a good price. The space blankets are a great idea too, I don't throw any of mine away!  It wouldn't be a bad idea to bring a small stove like a Jet boil and make tea, coffee or hot cider for people. MRE couldn't hurt and the person could use the food heater as a hand warmer, I've done that plenty of times. Building a barrier between you and the ground is a huge help to survive in the cold. I use a air mattress when camping in the snow but your not going to be able to buy those for everyone so you could find a few layers of cardboard to sleep on.

"What an odd argument. I can't max out a gigabit pipe in a single download, so it has no use? There's plenty of sites out there that benefit from the faster connection. Also, what about multitasking or multiple users? 
I have Centurylink's Gigabit fiber and I'm super happy (now that the install process is finished). I like being able to stream a video or four while performing multiple large downloads, leaving plenty of overhead for all of those things to happen without stepping on each other. I can be watching something with a download or torrent in the background while my wife has an HD video conference call over VPN in the other room and there's never a blip. Again, I'm not maxing out the gigabit link for this stuff, but I'm certainly using more than I could with just a 100 mbps link, and I do this pretty regularly now.

I also like not having any sort of quota at the gigabit level. I can mount my unlimited Google Drive from school as a drive letter. [LINK](http://www.expandrive.com/) and use it with speed good enough to treat like a local file server. No worrying about avoiding redundant downloads and not downloading too much because of some limit placed by the ISP. I love not having to ever even think about quotas.

This is my latest speed test.

Which basically means there are 3 ways the Sounders can win next Sunday:

1) a win
2) a draw
3) a loss by one goal where the sounders score at LEAST 2 goals. (i.e. 3-2, 4-3, 5-4, etc)

Also, roughly 95% of cyclist have liability insurance under their renters/homeowners policy which covers liability outside your home, including damage of an at-fault cyclist.

"But the 405 HOV lane isn't similar to I5 express at all. The new 405 HOV lane now has more merging in and out of the lane due to addition of people who pay to use, except now all this merging is concentrated into a few entry/exit points, causing congestion there. Previously there were less people merging in and out, and that merging was distributed along the length of the lane. 

The I5 express lanes dont just concentrate merges into a few locations, it literally has no exits between downtown and northgate. It does not deal with intermediary destinations like 405 or regular I5 does, making it a true express lanes and illustrates how 405 HOV lane is not express.

"Part of the answer--in this case--is answered in other comments here, where the tolling is *intended* to reduce usage in order to keep the lanes flowing at a federally and state-mandated minimum speed during rush hour.

The other answer is that gas taxes are, in the long term, a losing revenue model for funding highways. This is largely because of exponentially better gas mileage on the driving population of cars. Cars are using the road with the same or *more* frequency and wear/tear on roads while simultaneously putting less money into the collective pot to fix that wear and tear.

The money to make up for the lost revenues has to come from somewhere, and tolling is easier to implement than changing the entire funding structure from gas taxes to mileage taxes.",,,,SovietJugernaut,Eastlake,,1447958955,t5_2qhad,t3_3tgcxo,t1_cx5xzdx,13,1449900161,0,0,cx5zdlg,Seattle,13,,flair

"You have several errors in your understanding of history.

The civil right movement, yes, included several movements.  But if you look at the single biggest movement headed up by MLK, it was not like BLM.  There were clearly articulated goals and appeals to others to join in the movement, as well as working with friendly authorities.  If you look at the march to Montgomery, MLK went through the motions of working with the highest authorities to get permission.  

Stonewall was a good galvanizing moment but it did nothing to effect actual legal or even meaningful change. That didn't happen for decades until after Stonewall and was the result of alliances built up by people coming out, and the judicial process.  I lived through it, and I know, but you don't need my word for it.

"For starters regulate what apartment complexes can ask for in terms of deposits. I know several homeless people, including myself, that can't get into a place simply due to the qualifications and deposits needed. I can easily afford the monthly rent, I just can't get the money together for all the deposits.

In some cases I would have to get almost $5,000-$6,000 down just to get in. Considering most Americans have less than $3000 in their bank accounts that's a huge amount of money to put down.

It adds up, 1st month/last month and security deposit (usually equal to another month rent), then if you have a credit score below 700 they require an additional deposit (usually another month's rent), no rental history they require another deposit plus a co-signer or guarantor (which very few people would be able to get). Many places also require references, but disqualify family and friends. Who the hell else are homeless people going to get?

For instance, I have no rental history according to them since they only go back 1 year on rental history. But they go back 7 years on your credit history. Why? Why not go back 7 years on a rental history as well? 

When you talk about the homeless, it's not just about the cost of monthly rent being too high. Their requirements and qualifications also contribute to the problem.

"This is as good of time as any to put out my political/HOA analogy.  This type of person is rampant in the HOAs across America; they love the petty power.  Generally they are over 60 with a lot of time on their hands, and want to feel like they have still have control over things without a job or kid to look after.  They have a reputation for being grumpy old farts that love nitpicking, and spend their time dictating the color of paint on their neighbors houses or the length of their grass.

The same exact demographic is also really powerful politically.  Why do you think we have high sentences?  Because the old lady that wants you to spend $400 a month to get griped at for your choice in yard decorations is going to vote for tougher sentences to feel like they have control over crime.  Even though some politicians come from a difference branch of thinking (the libertarian side that actually wants small government), a large number get their votes from the same people that have the time and money to sit around all day and the frustration to randomly smite others they see as inferior.  And it all boils down to wanting control.  They want their morals to be the de facto standard, they want 1"" lawns, they want to hear their language and their language only, they want your home to match the neighborhood's paint colors, etc.

"Author David Sucher was somewhat well known 20 years ago for writing a book about Seattle's Urban Village planning approach.

I appreciate the fact that he's coming out with a constructive idea and one that seems designed to either placate or troll the NIMBYs, I'm not sure which. 

But two questions. One: if the triplexes can look like regular houses (as Sucher says in his piece), why not allow more than one per block? Especially closer to major transit lines (i.e. where people might not need cars and thus not add as much to parking pressure on the block)?

Two: this proposal spaces new housing out evenly across the city. As such, most of the units will not be close to transit or retail, and so they'll promote car ownership. There's a market for that lifestyle, agreed, but personally I'd prefer to see more concentrated growth that promotes further transit infrastructure development.

"**What is SPD Safe Place?** 

While Seattle is generally one of the safest and most progressive cities in the United States, crimes and discrimination related to the City's Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer/Questioning (LGBTQ) residents and visitors unfortunately still occur. SPD is committed to the safety of all LGBTQ residents and visitors.

Seattle Police Department (SPD) SAFE PLACE signage is being displayed by local supporting community members, businesses, schools and organizations that work closely with the Seattle Police Department in an effort to reduce anti-LGBTQ crimes, reduce LGBTQ student bullying and encourage the reporting of LGBTQ crimes. These are also locations supporting safe and secure places for victims of anti-LGBTQ related crimes and harassment. Calling 911 and waiting for police to respond is essential for holding suspects accountable and reducing hate crimes and harassment in general. 

In addition to the 911 police response to these incidents, the SPD has an LGBTQ liaison officer who promotes partnership efforts between the SPD and LGBTQ community and can be a resource for answers to questions you may have. The SPDSAFEPLACE.com website also has resources for the LGBTQ community.

"There are many reasons I-1366 is a terrible idea:

1. Our state is already in a budget hole and is being fined by the State Supreme Court for failing to adequately fund education - and we want to reduce state revenue by the billions? Look for tuition to jump 20%.

2. It blackmails our legislature by issuing an ultimatum that they have to send to the people a constitutional amendment for requiring 2/3 super-majority to raise taxes. 

3. The 2/3 super-majority is literally the stupidest idea ever. Why not have a 2/3 super-majority requirement for everything, like cutting spending, or fixing roads, etc? Because nothing would get done! Gov't is supposed to be rule by majority. In our system of government, you'll never get 66% of people to agree on everything. So unless we want to switch to a parliamentary system, it creates a dysfunctional government by empowering the minority to essentially hold the legislative process hostage. It disincentives compromising and deal-making. 

4. Its was tried before - in California - in the 2000s. Look what happened. A broken government, giant deficits, and crumbling infrastructure. Now that CA is no longer beholden by that rule, they are recovering economically, fixing infrastructure, building high speed rail, and tackling their water crisis (although perhaps not aggressively enough - but that's for another tirade). We know the 2/3 rule doesn't work.

So those are SOME of the reasons its terrible, aside from the fact that Tim Eyman is a scumbag whom is probably going to get prosecuted for misappropriating and embezzling campaign and initiative money.",,,,Polynya,,,1446656485,t5_2qhad,t3_3rffk3,t1_cwo9vcp,28,1449594943,0,0,cwoayyc,Seattle,28,,

"&gt; People will work where they can get a job.

Sorry, but that doesn't really apply to professional positions such as programmers. Their job mobility is extremely high compared to laborers. Furthermore there is actually a shortage of tech workers in Seattle and in the industry as a whole. Working at Amazon is _easily_ not the only choice.

&gt; Secondly, Amazon is highly compartmentalized.

So? Do they know what the overall ethos of the company is? Do they not see what happens externally in the public? Claiming ignorance because it is such a huge organization is really not fair. Amazon is an extremely public facing company, their actions that draw criticism are public facing. People that do not work at Amazon are aware of the problems Amazon causes.

Again, not saying that I agree with the protestors today, they suck, a lot, but I am saying that this sort of fallacious reasoning is not contributing towards any reasonable argument, and if anything breeds complacency towards real issues that do exist at Amazon and within the larger tech sphere (and I am a developer for over 18 years, I've worked in many different parts of the tech/computer engineering industry).

"I have a feeling this is going to turn out to be a ""if reasonable people"" kind of argument, but let's try it anyway.

&gt; the steady drumbeat of anti neighborhood propaganda ... you love all development, no matter who it fucks over in the process

OK, let's try on some things that I've personally been witness to:

- ""There are too many 4-pack townhouses around here and they look monotonous, we need something different.""  OK, how about rowhouses.  ""EWW, no yard?!  Where will families live?  That's completely incompatible with the neighborhood.""

- ""Not everyone needs a 5,000sqft lot and a yard, we need something different.""  OK, how about a 5-story condo, that tall because to build lower wouldn't be profitable to buy the land, and building it on a hard corner that's previously been zoned for townhouses?  ""EWW, 5 stories?!  That's way too tall and is completely incompatible with the neighborhood.""

- ""People are being driven out of inexpensive rentals because there aren't enough places to buy or rent that are affordable, we need something different.""  OK, here are three single-family houses standing on multi-family zoned lots facing a major arterial with a park and a small business building next to them and the nearest single-family house being four 3,000sqft lots away, so let's build a 4-story, 36-unit apartment building there.  ""EWW, that many apartments and so tall and so close to traditional houses?  That's way too much and is completely incompatible with the neighborhood.""

That happens at every single ""Neighborhood Association"" meeting I go to.  There's no compromise, no exchange of ideas, no ""if the developer does *x* to accede to the neighborhood's demands then the neighborhood will give on *y* other design/build/size complaint,"" nothing.  It is getting rather tiresome because I live here, too, and would like to have several of the things being proposed.  Heck, maybe someday I'd like to move into one of those proposed condos or rowhouses or even townhouses.

Given how these things normally go down, I'm starting to look forward to the day when I can sell my multi-family zoned lot and house that I bought for under $300k in the middle of the CD to some developer who's going to tear down my ""classic Craftsman"" and park three ""boxy"" townhouses on top of it, all legal because the zoning has been that way for twenty years.

Dear Amazonians,
 
Today, Amazon announced the expansion of our maternity and parental leave programs that give you more time and more choice in how to manage your leave in the way that works best for your family. We want to say thank you for the feedback and input you’ve provided to us over the last year as we were evaluating these programs. We take employee feedback very seriously and encourage you to continue sharing. You can see the full announcement on Inside Amazon, but here is a recap of the changes.
 
Who is eligible? These new benefits apply to all full-time hourly and salaried employees, including Fulfillment Center and Customer Service Associates. Interns, part-time, seasonal, and temporary employees are not eligible for these benefits. 
 
Details:
·         Birth mothers can now take up to 4 weeks of paid pre-partum medical leave followed by 10 weeks of paid maternity leave.
·         Birth mothers and all other new parents who have been at Amazon for a year or more can also take a new 6-week paid parental leave.
·         RSUs will continue to vest during the new pre-partum and maternity leaves. 
·         All together, these policies provide birth mothers who have been at Amazon more than one year with up to 20 weeks of leave.
·         The Leave Share Program allows an employee to share all or a portion of his or her six-week parental leave with a spouse or partner who doesn’t have paid leave through his or her employer.
·         The Ramp Back Program is for birth mothers and primary care givers and allows them ease back to work with up to 8 weeks of flexible time and choosing from part-time options of 50% or 75%.
·         Employees can choose when to take their parental leave time, either in one continuous 6-week period or split into two periods within 12 months of birth or adoption

If you have additional questions, you can visit Inside Amazon or contact the ERC at 888-892-7180. Thank you again for your valuable input. Please continue sharing.

"This has nothing to do with fear, it just has to do with logic. ISIS has made numerous threats that they are planning to wage Jihad on the United States (they've just began in Europe), they have no planes, no boats to get here, so logic says disguising yourself as a refugee and getting a free ride by our own government is the easiest way. ISIS has obviously thought of this, the Trojan Horse is the oldest trick in the book and couldn't have come at a more convenient time for them. It's genuinely absurd and ignorant to think that they wouldn't take this into consideration and implement it. They want to destroy our culture and people, why wouldn't they take advantage of this easy opportunity?
It's a sincere shame that because of this, many Muslims and refugees are having to pay the price for these extremists, but what can we do? There are no sufficient screening processes for people that come from war torn 3rd world countries.

All I can say is that I want my country to be free from the kind of violence that exists in the middle east, not for me, but for my children, and I will oppose anything that threatens my children's security.

"&gt; So just once I'd like to see someone discuss why people vote conservatively 

I'll do it, and I'll be as genuine as possible, unlike most of my normal posts. Here's a one line, plain text explanation:

As a fiscal conservative (and a highly educated one at that), I would rather see a funding deadlock and some regions starved due to lack of consensus than simple majorities push through ridiculous spending hikes. 

I vote for the prop not because I care about the 1% sales tax decrease, but because I support a 2/3rds vote for all tax increases. That opinion is based on living in California, where I watched ""save the schools"" and ""save the firemen"" calls every year for new taxes, and taxes go up, and up, and up, and the corruption of state government go up, and up, and up in response. When 10-13% income tax and 8% sales tax and 1% property tax and a 30% corporate tax aren't enough to pull a state (CA) out of a deficit, you know that the state spending is ridiculously out of control. Knowing what the broken extreme looks like, I vote to keep WA from heading in that direction.

What Seattle-ites may see as a ""smart rich Seattle vs the poor dumb East"" proposition, I see as a ""naive versus overly paranoid"", where both sides are probably a little too far outside, and where forcing consensus is probably a good thing for the state, long term, if it can be done.

In the end it'll raise prices on carbon-expensive goods (at $15/ton, I don't know how much - anyone got data?) and that's a good thing, because it'll be closer to reflecting the true costs of those goods.

"Lived here since 1972. The ""soul"" of Seattle has always been it physical location.  Best big mountains, saltwater and freshwater proximity and views of any metro area in the lower 48 states.  None of that has changed.  The fact that my former ghetto neighborhood is now fully gentrified is indeed a change and sometimes parts of that change seem bothersome but generally I like it.  People that think ""soul"" of their city is manifested by economics and business activity seem off base in their use of the word.  Seattle wanted to become a ""world class city"" and that has happened we are not the sleepy regional city we were 40 years ago.

"The right to peaceably assemble does not imply the right to assemble wherever and whenever you want. There are reasonable limitations to any right, even constitutionally protected ones. For example, the right to freedom of speech does not give me license to incite a riot, or yell ""Fire!"" in a crowded theater, or make death threats, etc. 

Similarly, the right to peaceably assemble does not *necessarily* guarantee me the right to assemble on someone else's private property, or restrict the liberty of others, or block traffic with a bunch of my friends. 

The fact is, they could have assembled and had this protest on the lawn or any number of other public places and not blocked traffic at all. Unless for some reason the roadway was the only reasonable location for their assembly, I have to believe that their forceable removal would not necessarily be an infringement on their rights.

"&gt; Nothing fancy but apparently Comcast has no service along University Way NE (Im at 43rd) because it doesn't think there are enough potential customers.

Ah hah, the light dawns for me.  University Way NE is like a few other areas of town: buried utilities were required years ago.  My guess is that Comcast simply never buried any equipment on your block because, hey, no customers at the time.  (More points to that theory if you're in a building that is/was/has-ever-been owned or leased by the University or the Post Office.)  Now anybody new there who wants service has to pay to break up the street--and for street closure permits and time on one of the busiest arterials in the city--*and* for the added equipment.  That's also likely why CenturyLink doesn't have fiber, they haven't gotten around to the ""chisel up the streets and shoot fiber through conduit"" stage of their build-out.

I'm kind of in the same boat as you.  My fiber from CL crosses somewhere it shouldn't and if my next door neighbor ever has a problem, she and I--and our lawyers--are going to have a field day over things like ""prescriptive easements"" and ""barricaded utilities.""

Have you tried talking to the city's [Office of Cable Communications](http://www.seattle.gov/cable/franchises.htm)?  They *have* to have run into this before and maybe they know a workaround.

&gt; It takes anywhere from 18–24 months for a Syrian refugee to be cleared to live in the United States. First he or she must be registered with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. This agency interviews refugees, conducts background checks, takes their biometric data, and establishes whether they belong to one of roughly 45 “categories of concern” given their past lives and work history in Syria. Typically, the applicants are women and children. If anything looks amiss, they are pulled from consideration. Then the U.S. government begins its own vetting. The applicants are interviewed again, and their names and particulars are run through terrorism databases. They receive additional screening when they arrive in the United States and then again after their first year in the country. This process has led to slightly more than 1,800 Syrians being admitted to the United States since 2011.

Instead, where do you find those? On our precious Capitol Hill, that's where, and not brought here particularly by the Amazon boom. (In fact, before Amazon we had Taco Bell, Taco Time, Jack in the Box, you name it... all gone now.)

What's the most chain-ish place down there in SLU? Veggie Grill, a west coast vegan chain? A few Tom Douglas restaurants? OK, maybe a Specialty's.

Amazon has intentionally not moved its campus to a cheaper suburb and kept it near downtown Seattle, because the kind of people who work for them like the urban experience. They're going to eat ethnic food, explore new places, go to the theater, buy art, you name it. Amazon campus is full of food trucks. How much farther from Chipotle can you get?

"Guns are phallic symbols. Understanding the psychology of gun culture is essential to adapting our approach to gun ownership in a country with a gun problem. 

If it's a conversation we're having, then let's talk about how we can limit the number of crazy people who can legally buy guns. Let's discuss how we can keep toddlers from shooting each other, and how we can keep disaffected young men from going on shooting rampages. And we'd be remiss if we didn't talk about how our country's institutionalized racial bias has created a situation where it's 'normal' for police officers to shoot unarmed black people to death, or for gang members to shoot each other on a shockingly regular basis.

But you can't have a conversation about that gun culture without recognizing the central issue: the psychology of why we glorify guns. Why people cling to them and feel empowered by them, despite the often deadly side effect of getting shot by one. And part of that conversation involves the fact that they are surrogate penises.

"First of all, I recommend you look at [the /r/Seattle Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/wiki/index). Particularly the items about ""moving to Seattle"" and ""best and worst of living in Seattle"". 

Things to think about. : 

* Did either of you go to a large university? If so, get in touch with the Seattle-based alumni clubs. Ask your questions on their facebook page. They are likely to be welcoming and patient with giving advice. FSU and U of F have clubs here. 
* your rental history, credit scores, and background checks. It would be very unwise to break your current lease without an agreement with your landlord. It's a tight rental market here. Landlords will check your eviction history, credit history, criminal background. They will want proof of your employment. They will want a reference from prior landlords. If all those are good, you are in good shape, but finding a rental will still be difficult and expensive. If either of you are a veteran, there are a few agencies here that help find housing. 
* Tacoma and Olympia are not as expensive as Seattle Metro, but still very expensive. I really like Tacoma. Don't know Olympia. 
* Dog grooming. Perhaps you know that Seattle is dog-oriented. I would search for any dog care trade organizations to learn more. Phone a few groomers to see what the employment situation is. I don't know if dog grooming is big here, but other services like day care, raw feeding, doggie holistic products, dog rescue, are very big here. 
* Pets. If you have pets, your housing search will be tougher. Consider leaving your pets with family until after you've settled in. 
* Make sure you have employment before you get here. 
* I provide services to people who are homeless and low income in Seattle. I meet many people, individuals, couples, families who moved here and couldn't get housing. They live in their vehicles, in shelters, or on the street. Many of them are employed with good jobs, but don't have enough to get into an apartment. Our region has many homeless people. Please be very prepared, so it won't happen to you. 
* the people who suggest that you work on yourselves and get your heads in a better place... those people are probably right. But I think it's more important to be in good financial shape. Have savings and employment. If you have any credit problems or background issues, you need a plan to deal with them. When I moved to Seattle with my husband,  I was kind of a mess emotionally. Had a lot of problems. The change of location was really good for me, and I love it here. But we were financially fit when we moved here. 

Sorry about all the reality. Good luck to you!

"Yeah, all of those camps are filled with bike thieves. They've been doing this for ages with zero consequences, and they steal more than just bikes from surrounding homes and businesses. Sometimes the bikes don't even go far: They have a chop shop setup in an RV nearby, but they're often just openly tearing bikes down next to their tents. I've long since lost any sort of sympathy for all of these people. They're not doing what they have to do for survival, they're doing it because they'd rather just steal stuff for drug money and get fucked up in their own filth. They are living this lifestyle by choice and have no desire to change. On top of all the obvious stuff already mentioned, they've threatened bodily harm and bike theft directly to myself and multiple other people I know. This isn't a single isolated occurrence either, but a recurring theme.

The police know about what goes on. It's not new and it's constantly occurring. I probably see them clearing out the camps at least once a month, but they just pop up again right down the road. I can't decide if I think they're powerless to do anything or that they just don't care. 

It's gotten to the point where I actually can say I loathe these people. The way I feel about them and the things I wish would happen to them sort of horrifies me and makes me question my own ethics a little bit.

"I am mostly worried about the poor driving that often comes form E-hailed drivers when picking up or dropping off people. With a yellow cab I can somewhat predict that they may suddenly stop in the middle of the road to pick people up or drop them off: I don't like it but because they are marked I can tell. All too often I am driving or riding my bike and suddenly a Prius just slams on the brakes to pick someone up, or pulls a left turn from the rightmost of 3 lanes. I definitely like the challenge to the market that ride sharing is bringing but the fact that there is are basically no consequences for driving like total shit concerns me. Sure passengers can rate dangerous behavior but that doesn't cover the time between passengers or when the drivers make dangerous moves that benefit the passenger. 

Yes some of the regulations are burdensome but at the same time calling the city to complain about a taxi (with the cab #) in most cities can bring about pretty serious action. At the very least I would like it if ride-share cars were identified with a clear marker and number (maybe like the pizza delivery lights). I also at least know that cab have to carry some pretty heavy insurance to operate, and I am really afraid of getting taken out by a Uber driver while biking/walking home, I understand Uber carries insurance on their drivers but there are a lot of loopholes and private insurance is definitely willing to drop coverage if the driver doesn't pay for extra ride-sharing insurance options.",,,,xarune,Fremont,,1447895271,t5_2qhad,t3_3tchvx,t1_cx53icf,14,1449886732,0,0,cx575zg,Seattle,14,,flair

I think its fantastic that they're going to unify the system and have all of our streetcar rolling stock the same, that way a rider can successfully go from broadway to SLU or visa versa in one run via streetcar, rather than transferring at westlake in some awkward fashion from an older, non-battery, non-compatible car to the new First Hill battery units. If SDOT's going to implement streetcars in seattle, might as well do it right and this is an excellent move in the right direction.

Edit: honest answer

If you're making $100k/yr for a single household and think it's tight then you don't know how to budget. I make about 50k and manage my apt building which saves on rent. I have a 1br in cap hill with all the amenities. I don't go out much and if I do beers aren't $9. Mostly hang out with friends at someone's place for cooking and games and drinking. Cook at home a lot with friends. Don't own a car and walk lots of places or ride the bus. I still go to Sounders games and take classes for fun and go to concerts and dates for less than $100. Spending more doesn't make things fun. I save a lot and don't play video games or buy expensive clothes. I save for trips and enjoy buying gifts for friends. I see people wasting money on solo wheels and taking an uber to work every day and it drives me nuts how much people waste money on garbage. I'd rather have a comfortable retirement than the newest gizmo.

Far fewer people would be shot in the US if US cops were taught how to deal with physically aggressive people the way UK cops are. 


Look, dude, you've lived here for a little while and I know being from the south makes you an expert on everything about police and brutality, but spend a tiny little amount of time on the internets reading about the SPD and you'll probably get a clearer picture.

I'm from DC and lived in Boston, I think I know what ""real"" cities and police look like - its not ""the south"" but I hope it gave me some perspective.

"you are 100% right that people should do what they can to be safe. that seems common-sensical. and the law already requires bicyclists to have [lights and reflectors](http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=46.61.780) after dark, so the state is with you to an extent. as a sometimes-cyclist and year-round all-weather scooter commuter i take steps with my behavior, equipment, and clothing to stay visible and safe.

however, by operating a motor vehicle on public roads, the driver of a car has taken on a responsibility to do so in a way that is safe for other road users. once the person on the bicycle has met the legal requirements of a front light and rear reflector, then it is up to the person driving to see them. that might mean driving slowly, looking two, three, four times, taking extra seconds or minutes before making a turn, leaving a stop, etc. the liability and responsibility is with the person in the car to see the person on the bicycle.

"&gt;  to retain talent if you don't offer a competitive compensation package

How do you measure ""talent""? The point about poaching also reveals out how little ""talent"" Michael Young even brought to the UW. There is no competitive market forcing Presidents making $700-900k to ""perform"" with any real metrics. What incentive do they have to ""perform"" when making that rate? This is a classic case of a public institution with few competitive forces usurping a captured market - and creating a moral hazard.

For example, Michael Young [responded](http://engage.washington.edu/site/MessageViewer?em_id=90281.0) to a question from a UW undergraduate who asked whether the university would help undergraduates finance their educations if Pell grants were cut. Young snidely remarked that such a scenario might require undergraduates to go out and actually get a “real job.” In [addition](http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/uw-president-says-saving-colleges-is-above-my-pay-grade/Content?oid=12379781), when asked if he supported addressing the state legislature to deal with skyrocketing university costs and budget cuts, University of Washington president Michael Young shrugged off the question, stating ""It's above my pay grade"". In fact, negotiating funding with legislators is a *primary essential duty of university presidents.* 

What sort of competitive talent is that? Where is there any evidence that they ""earn"" this $800k-$900k salary?

The burden of a causal arrow is backwards here. We say this amount is required to ""attract talent"" - but there is no evidence that the ""talent"" is *earning* the salary.

"My husband and I sold everything but what we could fit in our car 5 years ago (Nov 19, 2010). We slept on the floor of a friends house for 2 weeks until we were just tired of sleeping on the floor. 

We didn't just move here without having jobs first. My husband was able to keep his job but telecommute and I was hired at a company. Despite having jobs we didn't realize how expensive everything was here; I don't just mean rent and utilities, I mean food, gas, taxes, etc. 

So after two weeks we moved in to an apartment and for several weeks only had an air mattress, a tote for a table, a tote for a desk, and a tote for a night stand. We had two bag chairs and necessities. We ate nothing but steam fresh veggies and chicken patties or hot dogs chopped up in to ramen noodles... I cannot eat those anymore without feeling disgust. 

Finally we couldn't wait to save anymore and rented a mattress and couch from Aarons Rentals. This made our lives more comfortable and slowly we began to fill our apartment. 

Now 5 years later we are doing much better, our families understand that we aren't coming back and are proud of us. When we first told them we were moving they told us how unrealistic we were being and that we'd never make it. That is true for some people. If you don't get a job, if you don't have savings, if things just go horribly wrong, you'll be just another poor person on the streets. 

My advice is to apply to jobs out here, interview via telephone and skype. Maybe you're girlfriend can get a job with College Nannies and Tutors, that's who hired me when I first moved out here. Save at least enough to get yourselves here and pay two months of rent plus deposits until you get your first paychecks. Do not come out here with nothing in your pockets. Though we came out here with jobs and some savings ($2000) we struggled and I'd never be that unprepared again. 

Perhaps work in a neighboring city to where you are at, or move to a city nearby to get you out of your situation but somewhere new. Get a job at a chain company like Holiday Inn, save a few months, and see if you can transfer or get a job you can do from home. It's great to make changes but not wise to put yourself in a bad situation.

"The full e-mail: 

Tuesday morning at 9:30, Amazon Books will open its doors. These aren't metaphorical doors: these real, wooden doors are the entrance to our new store in Seattle's University Village. 

Amazon Books is a physical extension of Amazon.com. We've applied 20 years of online bookselling experience to build a store that integrates the benefits of offline and online book shopping. The books in our store are selected based on Amazon.com customer ratings, pre-orders, sales, popularity on Goodreads, and our curators' assessments. These are fantastic books! Most have been rated 4 stars or above, and many are award winners. 

To give you more information as you browse, our books are face-out, and under each one is a review card with the Amazon.com customer rating and a review. You can read the opinions and assessments of Amazon.com's book-loving customers to help you find great books. 

Prices at Amazon Books are the same as prices offered by Amazon.com, so you'll never need to compare our online and in-store prices. Nevertheless, our mobile app is a great way to read additional customer reviews, get more detailed information about a product, or even to buy products online. 

Amazon Books is a store without walls — there are thousands of books available in store and millions more available at Amazon.com. Walk out of the store with a book; lighten your load and buy it online (Prime customers, of course, won't pay for shipping); buy an eBook for your Kindle; or add a product to your Amazon Wish List, so someone else can buy it. 

At Amazon Books, you can also test drive Amazon's devices. Products across our Kindle, Echo, Fire TV, and Fire Tablet series are available for you to explore, and Amazon device experts will be on hand to answer questions and to show the products in action. 

Tomorrow is literally Day One for Amazon Books, and we hope you will visit and share your ideas and feedback by dropping a card in our suggestion box or telling us here.

We are located at 4601 26th Ave. NE in University Village, next to Banana Republic and across from JOEY Kitchen. We are open Monday through Saturday from 9:30 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. and on Sundays from 11:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. 

We hope to see you in the store —

People in Seattle don't do well with just 50cc on the hills like capital hill. I run 150 up the hills no problem. Those criteria in place, $650 does not get you very far.

"I was in the far right lane of an on-ramp. I would have had to cross 3 lanes of traffic coming out of an on-ramp. Also note that the shoulder and embankment ends as soon as the on-ramp ends, replaced by a guardrail with no shoulder. To reach the car, I would have had to cross 3 lanes, then drive backwards on the freeway to get back to the shoulder.

Instead, I immediately called 911. I think this was the safest decision. It kept me from endangering myself and other drivers on the freeway, while still getting the car help as soon as humanly possible.

I think situations where people can respond the way you suggested is when cars are broken down on the right side of the road, or if the accident occurs ahead of you in your lane. Then, you can safely merge into the shoulder, get out and help.

What drives me most crazy is a complete lack of confidence when merging or turning or just about everything; they slow down or stop on entrance/exit ramps -- which is super dangerous -- and seem to have no clue that there is enough space for them to come up to speed when merging. They'd rather stop completely and wait for all the lanes to clear, and then immediately 'merge' by crossing all the lanes to the left lane because in a mile they're going to eventually turn left.

"Is this supposed to be discrediting the grievances expressed by Black Lives Matter? 

To quote the President: 

&gt; “I think the reason that the organizers used the phrase “black lives matter” was not because they were suggesting nobody else’s lives matter,” he said. “What they were suggesting was, there is a specific problem that is happening in the African-American community that’s not happening in other communities. And that is a legitimate issue that we’ve got to address.”

Some [other](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-bedrick/whats-the-matter-with-all-lives-matter_b_7922482.html) points to think a litter harder about: 

* **1. In the shadow of 'All Lives Matter' is a form of willful colorblindness -- the erasure of the issue of race.**

&gt; When people say ""All Lives Matter"" in response to ""Black Lives Matter,"" they are not simply opening their arms to the greater diversity of humanity. Instead, they are taking race out of the conversation. While the statement masquerades as a bright and inclusive light, in the shadow of this statement hides a willful ignorance of America's racist past and present.

There is not doubt that racism exists today. The research evidence is vast, clear and widely available from differential stop and frisk rates, sentencing levels and job hiring.

&gt; A most telling statistic about the difference in the lack of valuation of a black life comes from a study conducted by Allan Collard-Wexler, an NYU Stern School economist: ""[T]he cost of adopting a black baby needs to be $38,000 lower than the cost of a white baby, in order to make parents indifferent to race.""

&gt; Adding insult to injury, asserting that all lives matter in response to black folks declaring that black lives matter, turns our eyes away from acknowledging America's racist past, functioning as a form of dismissal or denial.

* **2. In the shadow of 'All Lives Matter' lurks the privilege white folks have to not experience their own lives in racial terms.**

&gt; Let's face it, most white people don't regularly think about themselves as white. We are not made to think about our race, because we are not living in a pervasive systemic atmosphere that injures us because of our skin color. As such, we easily think of ourselves as a ""just a person,"" as a human being belonging to the human family.

&gt; When a white person responds to the statement ""Black Lives Matter"" by countering with ""All Lives Matter"" they exhibit a blindness to the privilege of living outside of a painful and marginalizing lens that highlights their race; a privilege not enjoyed by black and brown people.

&gt; In the words of Jarune Uwujaren, ""[I]f you have trouble seeing race or are tired of people making things about race, realize that if they could, most people of color would ignore race too.""

* **3. In the shadow of 'All Lives Matter' is an aggressive resistance to focusing on the value of black lives.**

&gt; The statement, ""All Lives Matter"" did not arise in a vacuum. It was not born of a passion for the value of all life; it is not a world-wide social movement for justice. It was a response, a retort, a counter-point to the statement ""Black Lives Matter."" While not everyone utters these words with this intent, the phrase nonetheless functions as a dismissal.

"It's hard to argue about something as subjective as a hood having a soul or not so here are some facts-

The Hill was once a place where punk/DIY kids could cram into a cheap house and play music, then go to another cheap house's basement and see another band play and hangout with their other friends who are all living in the same neighborhood with the same lifestyle. 

There were also lots of nearby warehouse venues and art spaces of dubious legality. Your crappy band could easily play the Comet, where tons of legendary Seattle bands played in the same area that now has a giant screen showing the same baseball game that can be watched by everyone in the country from their own house.

I think this is what a lot of people mean, at least in the music community (the gay scene has its own list of complaints), when they say the city has lost its soul.

I think what's offending me is that it takes away from our societies expansion of acceptance.

Starbucks existed 15 years ago, violence towards the LGBTQ quarter was very common, but Starbucks didn't have a thing to say then when it would have been bold support.

25 years ago starbucks existed, this program would have cost the company conservative acceptance.

35 years ago starbucks existed, this program would have been business suicide.

Today, the federal government recognizes all marriage.  The dept of education is making legal challenges on behalf of LGBTQ students.   
Today this program costs Starbucks nothing.

"Sure but I don't think you're necessarily the intended target. (And let's also remember, it's not really an organized movement so much as loose collection of individuals/groups under a common idea.)

If you think it's to convince the demographics of reddit (or similar) of, well, something, then sure, it's not well received or effective.

But if you believe that the goal is to drive the national political conversation, particularly among the Democratic presidential candidates, then it's been enormously effective. The Bernie Sanders BLM interruption is a prime example of this. After that happened his campaign spent significantly more time meeting with and addressing BLM issues, including promoting the movement's issues in the first Democratic debate. 

O'Malley was similar (went from ""all lives matter"" to apologizing and speaking eloquently about why ""black lives matter"" is the name of the movement within a day). And Hillary has met multiple times with BLM protestors and spoken about key policy initiatives in support of the movement.

So from that perspective I think it's been a surprisingly politically adept movement, considering it's lack of organizational leadership. 

But again, that's not really my point. **My point wasn't that the movement was effective.** In fact I specifically said I had no idea if it was. My point is I can understand why the movement exists *and* why it annoys people on reddit. I don't think there's an easy solution.

"As a former Floridian... the weather here actually isn't that gray most of the year. I know, I'm going to be kicked out of town for saying that the weather is great. The sky is pretty darn blue today and yesterday not a cloud in the sky. Summer was very clear and dry. Temps are pretty mild. The cold of winter is nothing like the heat of a Florida summer and I've actually been colder in Florida (16 degrees camping in Ocala one night, though certainly cold temps linger longer here). And Seattle has less precipitation than Florida, or at least the area I was from. Seriously, what they call ""rain"" here is kind of funny after living in Florida. Plus, you can leave windows open and not breathe sticky sauna air and have stuff mold! Fresh air is amazing stuff! I'll deal with a few months of off and on cloudiness for that versus hibernating inside with the AC on most of the year, passing out from the heat, and burning myself on seatbelt metal as I get into my car.   

People here who think racism or transit are bad need to go spend some time in Florida. True, Seattle is not perfect, and prides itself a little too much on being some progressive utopia, but compared to Florida or most of the country it practically is. And the bus system isn't all that bad, especially compared to Florida. There is a rail system. But if you do plan to use buses or trains frequently (and you probably should if you work anywhere near downtown), then take that into consideration when looking at places. There is also way more food options here and better. I've even had better citrus here. Friends-wise, it depends on what you put into it. There are a lot of great communities here. Be selective and patient when you start making new friends, but get out there and don't just sit at home sad that you don't know anyone. There are so many great meetups and other events going on that being social isn't hard. 

But yes, certainly see what else you can do for your mental health. Even if you do go through with it, a big move is super stressful. But sometimes people really are stuck in the wrong place. I can't say if Seattle is the best place for the OP, but I am glad I moved. The biggest reason I hear from friends about why they moved from Seattle back to Florida isn't any of those things above but simply missing family, especially if they were raising children and wanted to be closer for the grandparents. Missing the people you leave behind is a big stress of most moves.  ",,,,M4124124,,,1448661373,t5_2qhad,t3_3ui8py,t1_cxf28kn,13,1450070469,0,0,cxf3jvi,Seattle,13,,

"Check [Wedding Wire](http://www.weddingwire.com/) and [The Knot](https://www.theknot.com/) for vendors of all sorts. Without knowing how many guests it's a little difficult to recommend a venue for you. I'll photographed a few weddings at inexpensive venues around the city this summer/fall though so I'll try to name a few of the ones that stood out.

* [Thornewood Castle](https://www.thornewoodcastle.com/) this September and it was a pretty breath-taking venue all around. Supposedly it's on the affordable side, but they limit the party to 5 or 6 hours which isn't long for a full wedding, and in turn may not be your money's worth.

* [Sole Repair](http://www.solerepairshop.com/) on Capitol Hill is also incredibly affordable, but your head count needs to be around 100 or less and you may have some folks standing. It's great for a small wedding and a larger reception, and is very lenient on whether or not you include food or alcohol. You can bring your own kegs too. Awesome!

* [South Seattle College Arboretum](http://www.southseattle.edu/arboretum/) this summer, which I thought was a pretty slammin' idea for a small wedding on a dime. Totally gorgeous for pictures too.

* [WithinSodo](http://www.withinsodo.com/) I believe was an affordable wedding venue as well. I think you can rent it out by room. Rooftop deck with a view is fun for a summer wedding too!

* Interestingly enough, [the Balmar](http://www.thebalmar.com/) in Ballard does weddings sometimes.. The bride at the wedding I shot got it for free for the day, but you'd have to inquire about something like this with the owners. I'm not sure what their policy is.

* [Melrose Market Studios](http://www.melrosemarketstudios.com/) offers rentals for 24 hours and holds 250 people. I'm not sure what the pricing is on this one, but it was 2nd on the list for a friend who was recently searching for venues on a budget (he eventually went with Sole Repair).

* My favorite wedding ever was at [Willie Green's Organic Farm](http://www.williegreens.org/) in Monroe this August. Simply beautiful, but also deep.

"Yes, it fails in court and then our state legislators write it up as a bill and pass it under their own authority.  IE - 1% property tax limit

http://www.seattlepi.com/local/article/Lawmakers-restore-1-property-tax-cap-1257294.php

*OLYMPIA -- Democrats made short work Thursday of reinstating a 1 percent cap on property tax increases during a one-day special session of the Legislature.  Though factions from the left and the right condemned the proposal, it passed in the House and Senate with wide bipartisan support (It passed in the Senate 39-9 and in the House 86-8), and lawmakers adjourned about 7:30 p.m. Concerns about public policy were trumped by the overwhelming political preservation instinct that comes with a vote on a measure that has already been passed with a vote of the people.*

*""We have a compact with voters,"" said Rep. Brendan Williams, D-Olympia. ""When voters legislate, we need to respect their work, too.""*

*In 2001, voters approved Initiative 747, a measure sponsored by Tim Eyman that capped annual increases of certain property taxes at 1 percent. Earlier this month, the state Supreme Court threw out the measure on technical grounds.*",,,,ChefJoe98136,West Seattle,,1446614465,t5_2qhad,t3_3rffk3,t1_cwnu4vg,10,1449587078,0,0,cwnuk24,Seattle,10,,flair

"&gt; It's hubris to assume that voters will accept an endless string of levys. Everyone loves to bitch about Tim Eyman but his tax restriction initiatives had votes in city limits. Even the mayor has expressed concern over voter fatigue.

It's not hubris, it's the legal system we set up.  Voters have to be asked because the rate of tax income was deliberately set to grow lower than the rate of inflation.  In real dollars, the City of Seattle as a spending entity can never keep up with how much things actually cost to do when relying solely upon the constitutional property tax limits.  That was by design when the constitutional limit was passed so now we get levy lift votes.  (I'd also like to take this time to point out that, save municipalities like Medina, Clyde Hill, or Beaux Arts, Seattle ranks at the bottom of the list for property tax rate.  We pay less here than even our compatriots directly across NE 145th St in Shoreline.)

&gt; Your point here boils down to: "" well just vote to spend more! "" not very convincing.

Of course it does, because that's the system we have.  If we want ""major thing *x*,"" our system has said we have to vote to authorize that spending.  Convincing or not, that's the reality of the levy lift system.

&gt; They are proposals alright, but not goals, ultimately they are nothing more than platitudes.

What makes you think they are not goals?  Why go to the trouble of making the map if it's going to be ignored?  That seems to be the biggest linchpin of this entire discussion: should the city be locked into a rigid set of plans that cannot be changed or should there be flexibility in how the plans--that have been documented, debated, discussed, and described--are implemented if things change during the 9-year lifespan of the levy?

&gt; Since the supporters of this levy have not demonstrated how oversight will work, and even when they have tried they have failed to disprove claims of a majority vote override.

Well, allow me to quote [the actual legislation upon which we are voting](http://www.seattle.gov/transportation/docs/CB%20118402%20FINAL.pdf), which specifies the oversight and funding change rules, in addition to, of course, our option of *voting out the elected officials* who don't follow what we've asked:

&gt; The Levy Proceeds shall be used solely for Transportation Improvements in accordance with the provisions in Section 6 and in accordance with RCW 84.55.050.

...

&gt; The nine-year appropriation amounts of Levy Proceeds for each core category established in this Section 6 may be changed by up to ten percent of the amount listed for each core category by separate ordinance, after the Levy Oversight Committee has been given an opportunity to comment. The nine-year appropriations amount of Levy Proceeds for each core category established in this Section 6 may be changed by more than ten percent of the amount listed for each core category by a 3/4 vote of City Council.

...

&gt; Conditioned upon voter approval of the ballot proposition submitted by this ordinance, there is established an Oversight Committee to monitor revenues, expenditures, and program and project implementation, and to advise the City Council, the Mayor, and the Seattle Department of Transportation on responding to program and project cost savings or overruns.

...

&gt; The Oversight Committee shall consist of 16 members: a City Council member (the Chair of the City Council's Transportation Committee or its successor committee with responsibility for transportation); the City Budget Director; one representative each chosen by and from among the respective members of the Seattle Pedestrian Advisory Board, Seattle Bicycle Advisory Board, Seattle Transit Advisory Board, and Seattle Freight Board; five Seattle residents appointed by the City Council, including a licensed engineer with bridge and structures experience; and five Seattle residents appointed by the Mayor and subject to confirmation by the City Council.",,,,somenewuser,Central Area,,1446538725,t5_2qhad,t3_3rbavg,t1_cwmoe1i,11,1449567026,0,0,cwmokno,Seattle,11,,flair

"Nice! One less bus that blocks up an entire intersection with its long-ass rear end.  

No but seriously, kudos to ST and CT for encouraging more double decker commuter buses! There's a reason why Brits have used these buses for time immemorial: they're much more compact and maneuverable on narrow streets, and carry the same number of people, if not more, in a smaller package. Transit, much like density, involves putting more people into less space, and this double decker is a prime example of that. I look forward to seeing more of these buses on 4th/5th Ave. soon.

How long have you lived in the city?  How many years, I'd like the number please.  I lived in the city as an adult for 18 years, I went to school there in the late 80's, wait I forgot I went to the UW as well, my family is from western washington, I've always considered Seattle my home and I've never lived anywhere but western washington.  I can't afford to have a house with a yard in Seattle and I have a dog, I had two dogs but they died recently I also had a child who is now 8, so there are considerations outside of where I wish to live.

If could afford to live in the city I would, I'd love to be your neighbor.

Do you know why the gum wall exists?  Because people like me in the late 80's and early 90's went and saw TheatreSports and because of almost live and the connection to improve, people were excited about Theatresports, so they lined up, and you had to get there early.

The lines would be an hour long, and lots wouldn't get in, and the gum wall became a thing, gum was big back then.

It was also full of cigarette butts back then.  I'm sure it's better now.

It's 15 miles of I5 to get to the gum wall from my house, which takes 15 minutes in no traffic, or 23 minutes on average.

Do you really think I don't represent people who live in Seattle?  I've lived in and worked in Seattle metro area (mostly Seattle) for 23 years, starting with the UW.

"I moved here from Louisville and the roads here terrify me.  There is a lot more dangerous driving to be found in the Seattle area by a long shot.  Between Seattle and Kentucky there's a HUGE difference in culture around cars.  You can't exist in Kentucky without one.  Everything is a 20 minute drive -- groceries, fast food, friends.  It's a city that is sprawled over a very large area, and public transit options are basically non-existent.  So everyone in Kentucky drives from the minute they turn 16.  That's a key differentiation from the PNW.  I am still taken by surprise when I talk to a mid-20's/early-30's adult who does not have their drivers license or a personal car.  

It's funny you use Louisville for comparison because I would put Kentucky drivers in a higher skill category than most Seattle seasoned drivers as a rule.  

I'm not saying that Kentucky drivers are some special breed, but experience does matter and in that they have a clear edge.  Some of the things that Seattle is plagued by are blind merges (people who merge, don't look/indicate/respond to the flow of traffic but rather just throw their car in and make it whoever they're about to smashes problem), inability to zipper merge, 20mph on interstates, no lights on during rain, no lights on at night, people slam on the brakes on tunnels because they freak out, and the road infrastructure here can't support the population (not the drivers fault but still a factor).  

The area is a lot more hilly/mountainous and that definitely contributes, but frankly the problems I see are not related to the difficulty of the road but rather the fact that most drivers are just not paying attention or aware of the rules of the road.  Cruising 35mph in the left lane with miles of traffic backed up behind you is actually against the law -- you're supposed to get over if you have more than 4(5?) cars behind you.  There's a major phone preoccupation with drivers here too, but it's been 5 years since I've spent more than a week in Kentucky so I'm thinking that's a universal problem and not a Seattle specific thing.  

I've tried to consider why Seattle drivers are so much worse than the rest of the country.  One factor that stands out is that the Seattle area is one that can be mostly navigated without having to own a vehicle.  Those little Car2Go scourges are some of the worst traffic offenders, and I can only assume it's because they are being driven by people who don't have a lot of experience driving (ie:  they don't own their own vehicle).  This region is dark and the lanes on interstates (5/405) are MUCH more narrow than any other city I've been to.  

Lanes in Louisville are much wider than anything in Seattle.  I-65 takes comparable daily traffic to I-5 or I-405, but never becomes a parking lot except when there's a wreck.  I-5 and I-405 are parking lots daily, starting around 7am and not really clearing up till 10pm.  The I-90 tunnels on Mercer Island are absolutely terrifying -- traffic moving at a 60mph pace immediately drops to 40.  I have no explanation for that. 

In 5 years here, I've been hit 4 times.  The worst offender was the lady that pushed my car 3 feet through a parking spot at Target in Renton.  She literally left her car right up against mine, with my car pushed out into traffic.  I waited for her to come back and she immediately went frantic, saying I hit her.  What the fuck?  Had a young man sideswipe me on the Sunset Blvd exit of I-405 North.  Two lanes turn left from that exit, I was in the left he was in the right.  When the light went green, he turned into my lane and scraped the side of my car.  When we stopped and talked, he didn't realize that he was supposed to stay in his lane through the exit.  How he hadn't hit someone up until this point who the hell knows. 

On Grady Way, I have seen someone slow down and stop for a green light.  Not once -- but 3 times!  As a matter of fact, I was laughing with my friend about it when it happened the third time right in front of us.  I've bought a dashcam to record all the terrifying things I find on the roads here and document it for future generations.   

I'm just saying that as a civilian driver with 600k+ miles under his belt, Seattle drivers are a terrifying lot.  Easily among the worst in the states.  ",,,,heinekev,,,1447089373,t5_2qhad,t3_3s4qin,t1_cwu5jgn,10,1449697578,0,0,cwu909l,Seattle,10,,
"My wife is starting a job in Bellevue on the 1st.  She's been taking the bus from the Lynnwood Park &amp; Ride to downtown.  It's been about the same as single occupant driving as far as time, so it wasn't that big of a deal to switch to buses.  The biggest reason for switching to buses?  Parking. Parking is outrageously expensive as a % of commuting. 

We would totally pay the $1.50/day to shave 20 min or more a day on the commute.  This still doesn't solve the cost of parking.  The extra $30/mo for the express lanes aren't worth it when you have to pay $200-$400/mo for parking on top of it.  Those that do drive daily AND can't afford the toll..where do you park in downtown Bellevue?

The Lynnwood park &amp; ride has close to 1000 parking spaces and it's still full after 7am meaning you have to park on nearby streets. 
The Canyon park park &amp; ride (which has express routes from there to Bellevue) only has like 300 spaces, so I'm sure it's full after 6am and there aren't really any viable street parking nearby.

Why does one down vote me instead of actually responding to me? To me that feels like the same level as telling me to stop telling you to comment, which seeps pretty contradictory. Maybe if you told me why I was wrong instead of just downvoting me I would actually know why I was wrong and you are right.

"&gt;They even lack magnetic car-detecting loops in the pavement

Awesome, I love intelligent stop lights. Some of the intersections near my work in Kent are shockingly efficient at their ability to adapt and move vehicles through quickly.

My only concern is regarding installation of inductive trigger loops for cyclists at all the intersections in SLU. There is nothing worse than being a law abiding cyclist and waiting for 2 light cycles only to discover there is no trigger in the bike lane and you either need to get in the primary car lane to trigger or ride up the sidewalk and punch the sit-n-beg pedestrian button.

This might be a good time for a cyclist protip: 
Ever see those white ""T"" letters painted on the pavement at an intersection? Those are for you! If you place your wheel right over the ""T"" you can let the stop light circuit you are waiting. There are even some neat ones in Portland that will shine a blue LED towards you as a confirmation that the circuit acknowledges you presence.
Here is a photo of one of the ""T""s for reference: https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xpa1/t51.2885-15/e15/11273091_1007491919260891_12822085_n.jpg

"As many of you know, I am homeless. I live in an alley doorway, and have for the past year. I have been to every shelter in the city- those bedbug infested, criminal harboring rat holes. My doorway is the safest place I've found, and I consider myself one of the few very lucky homeless. I've come to know all the employees and tenants around me, they love and respect me for the fact that I clean my alley, and always am in good cheer offering kind words and intelligent conversation when they come through. I get paid by the local businesses, tenants, and building managers to tend to the alley, clean, and kick out loud tweakers in the middle of the night. I am considered alley security and maintenance.

While I've found a suitable place where I've made many very good friends (who let me shower and cook at their places, crash if the weather gets too rough), most homeless don't find that *luxury, due to mental health and substance abuse issues that leave them blind and lost, unable to think. While I fall into a similar category (depression, PTSD, alcoholism), I've managed to avoid the hard stuff, and have cultivated a respectable situation for myself on the street, if there is such a thing. If I weren't always carrying around two backpacks with a bed roll, most would just think I was a regular working joe, since I keep myself well kempt, and am relatively bright.

I've seen it all, I've been around the block. I've crashed under the overpass under Pine Street, I've slept just about everywhere including bus shelters in the freezing dead of winter, city parks, church steps, and the ""jungle"". I thank god I found my alley. I love almost everyone there. I am very lucky, and they are thankful to have me because if it weren't me there, it would be drug users doing deals, causing commotion and making noise in the middle of the night, pooping and peeing everywhere.

While providing more beds is all well and good, I've found that programs that treat addiction, teach basic skills (either labor trades or computer science), and general life skills would be more beneficial than just building more shelters where the wasted can go to crash when it's cold, and do it again the next day, and again, and again. That's why I chose an alley doorway. I can stay away from those elements to a certain extent, and leave myself to my own devices.

If anyone is curious about my alley, PM me. I keep it so clean that almost every week, professional models do photoshoots there.

"Having had some firsthand experience with these axles I would suggest that the axle itself is inappropriate for the vehicle weight and use.

The modifications that are being discussed are actually reinforcements intended to prevent fractures at the ends of the axle housing. The fact that this is even a concern at all suggests the axle isn't robust enough for the application.

The axle is actually surplus from the 40s or 50s--not modern at all. But the duck is actually a (stretched, heavier) replica built on an old deuce and a half chassis by Ride the Ducks International.

Basically modifications should have strengthened the housing rather than cause this failure. But really commercial vehicles should never need such band aids in the first place if they are designed and configured well.

"It's comical if you look up resources about this because they will generally say ""call the police"" and ""touch nothing for forensic purposes in order to collect fingerprint or hair samples"". 

Since you live in Seattle, don't bother with those obviously, and just fill out the online form to get a case number. You'd then provide that to the landlord. I doubt your lease has a clause that talks to damages being your responsibility from a burglary, and I don't think there's any RCW or SMC language as to who is ultimately responsible so maybe it is a bit of a grey area. Generally speaking though, you are responsible for your belongings (renter's insurance) and the landlord is responsible for the property (property insurance).

[Here is a pamphlet from the Washington State Bar](http://www.wsba.org/~/media/Files/News_Events/Publications/Consumer%20Info%20Pamphlets/Landlord%20Tenant%200211.ashx)

&gt; Upkeep and Repairs
&gt; 
&gt; The landlord must maintain the premises in compliance with specific building codes and local ordinances; common areas must be kept clean and safe; facilities and appliances must be in reasonably good working order. Damage caused by weather, acts of God (such as earthquakes and accidents), or **damage caused by unknown third parties are generally the responsibility of the landlord**. 

Much like if the property was damaged by something out of your control or wear and tear, you would not fix it, as you have no right or obligation to modify or repair the landlord's property.

Share the pamphlet or statement from the bar association, meet with your landlord about repairing the storage unit, and not only talk about repair, but solutions for preventing future break-ins. It helps to show some initiative and approach it together rather than two sides telling each other what to do. You both have an interest in it coming to a reasonable conclusion that both repairs the property and secures it for the future.",,,,dontstalkmedude,,,1448472754,t5_2qhad,t3_3u6mef,t3_3u6mef,12,1450017341,0,0,cxcrvh1,Seattle,12,,

"Last Thanksgiving, enroute from Seattle to San Francisco, our pilot announced we had time to take a 20 minute detour around Mt. St. Helens. He warned us that the flight would take a tight loop around the crater and to sit tight as we'd be pulling some g's during the duration of the deviation. He wasn't kidding. A few minutes later, the slopes of St. Helens appeared in full view on the port side windows, with the lip of the crater about a thousand feet below us. We then made a sharp angle as we stared down into the crater, making a full 360 turn around the summit. It was awesome. [ I grabbed a few pics at the start of the tour](http://imgur.com/a/w2Z4Z). 

The crazy part of the trip was that only a few of us were interested in the tour. Most of the passengers didn't seem to have any clue that we were were deviating from course, even with the plane at an atypical bank.

I spoke to an officer who was near the protest. He said they did not receive necessary permits for their protest and it is completely illegal. Also they are blocking a major bus route. There are dozens of busses backed up in either direction. Also they are blocking one of the main routes to the UW medicine hospital. They are inconveniencing hundreds of people and potentially making it harder for ambulances to get to the hospital in case of emergencies.

I find the irony in this line of thought bitterly  hilarious. The point of the protest is that black students on campus are not afforded the same ability to study  and learn on the campuses they pay equal tuition to attend. Their education is disrupted by  systemic racism -- they are unable to study due to the culture of fear on campus. Other students at UW got a taste of that disrupted learning environment today and it wasn't to their liking.

Whatever the truth of the Brown case, its clear that the police department there has a long history of questionable conduct and that the prosecuter didn't push very hard - so its not unreasonable to assume that there was more to the story. Similarly, I have a dual citizenship and have spent a lot of time in the UK - the cops don't have guns and they definitely could have arrested Brown without much difficulty. Part of the issue isn't whether or not Brown was in the wrong, but about US police response to mild physical interactions that other police forces around the world deal with in absence of lethal weapons.

"If you're curious, according to a post SPD made on nextdoor, SPD classifies calls for service in three general priorities for response:

Priority 1 – Life-threatening emergencies, Crimes against persons, and some crimes that are in-progress or have just occurred. 

Priority 2 – Crimes against property that are occurring or have just occurred, disturbances where persons are present 

Priority 3 – Investigations (No suspect at scene), general nuisances, parking complaints 

Priority 1 calls are intended to be responded to within 7 minutes or less and SPD does so the majority of the time. 
Priority 2 calls are intended to be dispatched within 16 minutes and Priority 3 calls within 40 minutes however SPD has acknowledged that they currently can't meet those response goals on a routine basis. They said in 2014 the average response time for a Priority 2 call was 29.8 mins and 61.8 mins for Priority 3 calls. 

I would guess your call would've been classified as a Priority 2 initially but may have been downgraded to a 3 once it was clear the guy was gone. Given the time of day and what else was going on in the city it's not too surprising that the response time was above average. 1.5+ hours is pretty disappointing though.

"Heh...

A few friends of mine who all live in the Portland area met in Vegas near the end of August for a reunion of sorts. Half of that group bought tickets on Spirit since they already do PDX-Vegas and the other half flew Alaska. The couple flying Alaska and I (I left from SEA) all made it to Vegas on time. The Spirit fliers on the other hand had their flight cancelled after being delayed for three hours, loaded onto and removed from the broken plane twice, and promised they would make it out that night. They had to spend the night at the PDX airport eating vending machine food since Spirit will not comp you a hotel and the restaurants had all shut by the time the flight cancelled for good. They were also not reimbursed for their lost hotel night in Vegas (Spirit doesn't do that) and got rebooked on American with a connection in Phoenix the next day and as a result didn't get into Vegas until around noon.

All that misery and I asked them how much they saved with the Spirit tickets thinking between the three of them it still might be close to breaking even since Spirit is supposed to be dirt cheap. Nope, once they had paid for their carry-on bags (yes, carry-ons) and all the other ""extras"" and fees they only saved about $25/ticket vs. flying Alaska so they were very much in the hole on the deal.

"I went to Washington Middle School and your experience really depends on what program you're placed in. There are three separate programs available and your child will have to take a test before attending the school (and mostly likely other schools) to determine what level they will be placed in. 

The highest level is APP (Advanced Placement Program) and was only offered at WMS at the time. The second highest is Spectrum which is an accelerated learning program available throughout the school district yet still more advanced than the standard level. Lastly is the normal middle school program which you could find anywhere.. 

The major difference between the highest two levels and the normal curriculum is that accelerated classes are available giving your child a head start in the their high school credits. For example an 8th grader could be taking Freshman/Sophomore or even Junior math classes in middle school, have those credits transfer over and even start college courses halfway through high school! I also believe that they implement a different teaching style at these levels and hire more capable teachers.. But that's just me! Also, classes are generally smaller and potentially less hostile..

Most importantly attending the APP program at Washington Middle School nearly ensures a guaranteed spot at neighborhood school and one of the top high schools in Seattle, Garfield High School.

Regarding safety, I never felt threatened at school or felt as if I was ever in danger even though lock downs were very frequent.. The neighborhood is known to be rough but the school remains secure and in track of their students at all times. They also have a very regimented detention center.. so you can expect good behavior in the presence of a staff member!

Keep in mind it's been a few years since I was there and you should see what programs are currently available for your child and where!!!
If the programs still stands WMS would be a good school for them specifically if they are a ""gifted-student"" (as they say) as the school will do their best to get them a head start on High School/College.

TLDR; I went to WMS. It's a good school if you're in the higher programs. Otherwise what school you go to doesn't matter til you get to high school and even then your placement depends on where you live..

Hope this helps a bit! Feel free to ask any questions if I missed anything. But really, it's been a while, you should check if APP even exist and it could be that it has spread to other schools as well.",,,,iiIllIii,,,1447693271,t5_2qhad,t3_3t0hkt,t3_3t0hkt,10,1449835011,0,0,cx27ob8,Seattle,10,,

Keep right except when passing, etc.
(1) Upon all roadways of sufficient width a vehicle shall be driven upon the right half of the roadway, except as follows:

     (a) When overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the same direction under the rules governing such movement;

     (b) When an obstruction exists making it necessary to drive to the left of the center of the highway; provided, any person so doing shall yield the right-of-way to all vehicles traveling in the proper direction upon the unobstructed portion of the highway within such distance as to constitute an immediate hazard;

     (c) Upon a roadway divided into three marked lanes and providing for two-way movement traffic under the rules applicable thereon; 

     (d) Upon a street or highway restricted to one-way traffic; or

     (e) Upon a highway having three lanes or less, when approaching a stationary authorized emergency vehicle, tow truck or other vehicle providing roadside assistance while operating warning lights with three hundred sixty degree visibility, or police vehicle as described under *RCW 46.61.212(2).

     (2) Upon all roadways having two or more lanes for traffic moving in the same direction, all vehicles shall be driven in the right-hand lane then available for traffic, except (a) when overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the same direction, (b) when traveling at a speed greater than the traffic flow, (c) when moving left to allow traffic to merge, or (d) when preparing for a left turn at an intersection, exit, or into a private road or driveway when such left turn is legally permitted. On any such roadway, a vehicle or combination over ten thousand pounds shall be driven only in the right-hand lane except under the conditions enumerated in (a) through (d) of this subsection.

     (3) No vehicle towing a trailer or no vehicle or combination over ten thousand pounds may be driven in the left-hand lane of a limited access roadway having three or more lanes for traffic moving in one direction except when preparing for a left turn at an intersection, exit, or into a private road or driveway when a left turn is legally permitted. This subsection does not apply to a vehicle using a high occupancy vehicle lane. A high occupancy vehicle lane is not considered the left-hand lane of a roadway. The department of transportation, in consultation with the Washington state patrol, shall adopt rules specifying (a) those circumstances where it is permissible for other vehicles to use the left lane in case of emergency or to facilitate the orderly flow of traffic, and (b) those segments of limited access roadway to be exempt from this subsection due to the operational characteristics of the roadway.

     (4) It is a traffic infraction to drive continuously in the left lane of a multilane roadway when it impedes the flow of other traffic.

     (5) Upon any roadway having four or more lanes for moving traffic and providing for two-way movement of traffic, a vehicle shall not be driven to the left of the center line of the roadway except when authorized by official traffic control devices designating certain lanes to the left side of the center of the roadway for use by traffic not otherwise permitted to use such lanes, or except as permitted under subsection (1)(b) of this section. However, this subsection shall not be construed as prohibiting the crossing of the center line in making a left turn into or from an alley, private road or driveway.

Voting for an Eyman initiative is pretty much like voting to tell government you're fed up and had enough, and the more you starve government out, the more it'll have to make better choices on funding essentials - police, fire, roads.

An Eyman voter is someone who believes less government is best, and who is tired of all these new arrival Seattle liberals thinking money grows on trees, when they, as small business people, homeowners, and people just trying to get by, keep being handed the bill.

"It boggles the mind how poorly designed the HOT lanes were, and almost as bad is how WSDOT is still claiming it's reducing traffic.

I have to travel from Kirkland to Bellevue Monday through Friday, and what used to be a 15-20 minute trip is now 25-30. In addition, it used to be that once I got on the freeway I would usually be able to drive all the way home without encountering any significant slowdowns. Now I *always* run into stop and go traffic near the 520 on ramp.

My mom's noticed it too. She lives in Renton and is actually considering moving closer because 405 traffic has gotten so bad she feels like she needs to treat visits to my home as an overnight stay.

I'm convinced that WSDOT is playing games with the statistics. They're saying ""all lanes"" as if to imply an improvement in traffic in every lane individually, when in reality the normal lanes ate getting dicked hardcore, but the HOT lanes are improving more than the regular lanes are getting worse.

A lot of people, when they see a Black student on campus, see them and think ""hmm I wonder if they earned their spot here, or if they were let in to meet a quota."" People don't think Black people truly belong on our college campus. It is this piece that those faceless statistics are missing. Black students at the rally spoke about how they constantly have to deal with their place in the school being questioned by those around them. This creates an environment on campus that gets in their way of learning and getting the most out of their college experience more than the 15 minutes of study time or the extra 45 minutes extra of commute time that people had to deal with. This is something that they have to deal with ON A DAILY BASIS. That is what the statistics that you so quickly pulled up are missing. I challenge you to try and empathize with the Black community of Seattle, and the rest of the country instead of immediately responding in one of the most disengaged ways possible by responding with soulless and faceless facts.",,,,treemonktheverdant,University District,,1447414618,t5_2qhad,t3_3slxe4,t1_cwys0rc,-11,1449775953,0,0,cwysbav,Seattle,-11,,flair
"Most of these replies are from people that don't live here.  There's a lot to like.  Restaurants are open late, it's walking distance to downtown, it's the best place in the city for accessing mass transit to anywhere in the region, it's affordable, and, unlike the rest of the city, everyone is here--races and classes mingle.  

Downsides. You asked about noise. It's loud at night unless you have an interior apartment (which will be quieter but very little natural light).  For me, it's actually not people noise that's the problem, but highway rumble, rooftop chiller noise from the industrial zone to the south, and garbage trucks at 4 am after the restaurants close.  I sleep with earplugs.  Light pollution is higher than most of the rest of Seattle too. 

Safety.  You've gotta pay attention to what's going on around you, especially at night, and there are blocks and corners that you don't want to be around, but it's not nearly as bad as people make it out to be.  Most of what people are scared by is visible poverty and homelessness.  The vast majority of what appears to be criminal is just displaced people killing time, and most of the actual crime (which I admit is higher for Seattle ~~than the lily-white neighborhoods to the north and east~~) has nothing to do with you (unless you park on the street overnight with nice things for the taking left in sight). The riff raff fuck with each other mainly. 

One other downside. If you're friends are like mine, they'll view coming to your neighborhood as an excursion instead of just coming over to hang out.  Part of that is because it's the ID and most people visit it as tourists, and part of it is that parking stinks and so people that don't usually use the bus view it as an ordeal. 

So yeah, it's properly urban.  If you want to live somewhere with random street festivals, flower shops, busy affordable restaurants, bakeries (including Fuji which makes some of the best baguettes and croissants in the city if you can get one before they're gone), small functional apartments you don't have to fill needlessly, consider it. If you value running into people from walks of life you'd never otherwise see, consider it.  But you will hear and see some stuff sometimes, and you'll clutch your purse and walk faster after 11pm. 

I'm here because I value the vibrancy, transit access, style of apartment building, and price more than the downsides bug me.

They're right - how many black people were incarcerated for 20-life during Reagan's drug wars? Our prison system is disproportionately filled with black men who had nonviolent drug offenses in the '80s and '90s. The mass arrests and incarceration tore families apart. Of course, you don't see bankers who caused a massive economic crisis for profit behind bars, or white people who enjoyed a little blow during the crack scare.

If you want people to stay alive, why not support other modes of transportation being more visible, too? Why are you reticent to apply your own reasoning to walking and driving?

See, I know you mean well. It's just that we live in a culture where biking is seen as relatively esoteric, so it seems reasonable to place higher expectations on people biking to protect themselves than one would expect for driving or walking. That's what troubles me.

Plus, studies show that a huge contributor to bike safety is the number of people biking. If people think you have to wear reflective clothing to bike, they're going to think of it as a weird, dangerous thing, and will be less likely to do it. That means that those expectations can actually make biking less safe.",,,,LLJKCicero,,,1447732513,t5_2qhad,t3_3t3p81,t1_cx2w1qx,-12,1449847238,0,0,cx2x2qa,Seattle,-12,,

"Alright so luckily I play hockey in the area and can give you low down on the rinks in the area.

Lynnwood: Generally my favorite, nice ice, rentable lockers, plenty of parking, ambient music and free skates on the weekends which aren't too busy in the afternoons.

Olympic view(mountlake terrace): no free skate to my knowledge so I will gloss over that.

Kingsgate(Kirkland): Relatively frequent free skates, not as nice in general quality, has an odd smell to me (like bleach covered up with apple cinnamon candles), but good ice. Popular with figure skaters from what I remember which isn't great since they tend to be active during free skates.

Castle ice(Renton): another great option if south is more amicable for you, nice facilities, good ice, not sure about their free skate atmosphere though.

Comcast community center(everett): very warm for an ice arena if the cold temperature turns you off. Very rough parking situation, also haven't had a free skate there, but the silver tips arena is connected if you want to catch a game.

Kent ice center: very cold, lots of concrete so not great for sitting and chilling (Har Har). Good ice, again not a lot of free skate experience.

Highland(shoreline): real bad ice situation, gaps, divots, sometimes holes in the corner. Would not really recommend except for that it is close to Seattle.

Tacoma: even worse than highland, a converted meat locker. And no real redeeming qualities.

Bellevue square: outdoor, very crowded from what I've seen. Because it is not a long term attraction I would wager not great condition, same with the Seattle center.

'Poor' is relative. The minimum wage could most certainly be a living wage.

Your argument is that the working poor drive prices which ultimately makes the affluent poor. Sounds an awful lot like a *blame the victim* argument.

“There is risk associated of bringing anybody in from the outside, but specifically from a conflict zone like that,” Comey said. 

How are we to screen Thousands of people that come from a war torn, 3rd world country? What proper records exist of these people? And how can we verify that these records are true if any?

"First off, what you're doing is not only absolutely amazing but also admirable. It's people like you that keep my faith in other humans alive.

Secondly, speaking from experience when I was staying under a bridge near SLU, socks are insanely underrated. Not only for the warmth, but when all you really do all day is walk around they burn out pretty fast. When I got new socks, my situation seemed a little less shitty for a while.

The blankets are a good idea. It's hard to wash blankets on a regular basis, so if anything, it will be a nice barrier between the old blankets and their bodies.

The only thing I might suggest in addition to your already thorough list is fingernail clippers. It helps to have short nails so crap doesn't stay lodged under your nails for too long. And going back to walking around all day, it's very uncomfortable having long toe nails and clippers will reduce the risk of slight injury if you're just kinda picking them off with your fingernails.

I want to commend you again for your generosity; you will receive many many smiles from people whom smiling is not a daily activity. 

And actually, if you do this again I would be grateful if you let me donate some stuff to help ease the cost from your wallet. Let me know.

"Quoting the officer from the article:

&gt; “I’m getting calls from people saying it had happened to them or their friends,” Ritter recalled. “I’m getting calls from people  and they’re not matching up with the reports I have. I’d say, ‘Well, did you report these?’ and they’d say no. It was clear to  me that this was a huge problem for us, because if we don’t know about it we can’t devote resources to it.”

It's an attempt to close the gap between actual incidents and reported incidents, by ensuring those who are severely marginalized and stigmatized feel safe reporting it to someone. Doing so will help ensure better use of our police resources while also lowering crime. Straight crime victims are much more likely to feel safe reporting crimes they are a victim of.

"So here is the thing about Seattle.  It's not easy upfront because everybody is kind of closed off...buuuut getting laid is easy breezy.  I'm 31 now, but my 23-29 were basically me man whoring myself out there and doing my best not to date because it scared me.  Women wanted to date me, and in a way I did as well but I was far too immature and didn't understand my own feelings.  But the overall take away from the whole experience, having traveled to parts of the country, people are largely the same everywhere.  If you treat people like they're a stereotype of something, they will turn into that stereotype in front of your eyes and you're fucked.

So here is my suggestion.  Practice.  Go into bars that aren't in your neighborhood.  Never ever shit up your local bars with your piss poor attempts at trying to get laid or finding dates.  You don't want to be known as the guy whose desperate.  People talk and you want to make friends at your local spots, not try using it to find love.  Leave your mistakes for other neighborhoods.  You want to be able to take a nice girl you finally meet to somewhere people know you and treat you with respect.  Not just another schlub.  Having said that, you can, and it works, but until you're right in the head and comfortable with who you are.  Don't bother.  

So, here is my suggestion.  You want to get laid?  You want your dick wet?  Be honest about it, there is nothing wrong with fucking.  Everyone loves it.  And if that's what you want, enjoy.  Be respectful to people, don't try to use lame pick up lines you've learned from the internet.  People are smart.  They will pick up when you're trying to game them.  Even if they don't, your odds are against you unless you have drugs on you.  Soooo...  Go out alone to Belltown (most people in belltown are outta towners), U-District (college girls, being not in college is a plus and minus), Queen Anne, Ballard, fremont or Georgetown.  Basically any place there is a bar scene.  Avoid places like downtown Bellevue or fancy places or high energy spots, clubs etc.  The idea being is people are going there for something specific.  Unless you're trying to win over a sugar baby with money, pick up a cougar for fucking, etc it's a mess.  People who go into these high energy, high cost places know what they're doing.  You don't yet.  So go out to pubs, bars, not just dive bars, but those don't hurt.  Plenty of cool chicks hang out there.

And just practice talking to women you want to talk too.  At first going into large groups of people is hard.  But it really isn't.  You see a beautiful girl whose in a group of women or men?  Cool.  Introduce yourself to someone else but her.  Be friendly and a human being and just say hi to some bro, they're playing a game, compliment them on their pool game, ask if you can get next.  Afterwards you have an excuse to hover.  Maybe buy the next round.  Ignore the girl for now, practice just talking to people.  Not girls specifically. Eventually you can talk to the girl.  But if you bee line to the girl, everyone in the group will cock block you because it's obvious what you're doing.  You aren't being a human being, you're trying to get laid.  Once you're a rock star at talking to people, you can but until you get there, don't bother.  Start by asking what they're drinking, say it looks interesting, you havn't tried it.  Anything that is honest.  Don't bother with lines.  Because you're lying, it's not you.  But also don't be a dick and try to make fun of people.  Nobody likes to be made fun of and unless you're again, a rock star at talking to people and actually funny and playful with how you make fun of people, they will just get pissed.

But just because a girl is hanging out alone at the bar, doesn't mean shes easy to talk to either.  She could be waiting for her boyfriend.  Maybe having a shit day.  Everyone has their story on what brought them to where they are.  Be interested in that story.  Ask them sincere questions.  Don't just talk about yourself, but don't be meek and just keep asking questions.  Nobody likes playing 21 questions with a stranger.  But everyone likes making a connection with a stranger about common experiences.  Talking is a back and forth, you provide something, they provide something.

As far as online dating.  That's a mystery to me.  I've never gotten laid from it and it's because I'm terrible at selling myself in a profile.  It feels fake even though it's really not, people just want to know about you.  But how you take your pictures, all that shit, becomes important.  My buddy has much better success after a girl re-did his tinder profile.  So maybe try that.  And if someone asks about it, be honest.  

It also doesn't hurt to be semi good looking.  But it's not everything.  Don't try too hard, because I've seen plenty of big ripped dudes looking lonely at da club while I'm over here with my non-ab stomach about to get blown by the girl they've been eye fucking.

Basically, it's not a sprint.  All of this is a marathon.  Work on yourself, be okay with being alone for couple months.  Who cares.  You're still the same person.  Work on yourself first.  Get some light exercise and hobby's into your life.  Once you no longer look at movies as a guide on how to find love in a city, you're ready.  Before that, you're going to be living in a fantasy world, trying shit that won't work.

Blah...jesus I can go on about this shit for far too long.  If you have any specific questions, I'll be happy to answer.  But the biggest thing really is, you have to be comfortable with being yourself.  You're a dork?  Cool, embrace it. Don't become a stereotype but don't try to be something you aren't.  I'm a huge nerd but I also learned how to turn on mr. suave over the years.  You aren't static.  Things can be learned and nothing will be easy at first.  But if you practice talking to both men and women, eventually that fear of saying something incorrect, of the situation being foreign to you will go away.  You'll be comfortable with who you are.  And people will gravitate to you, because they'll sense you're calm, they know who you are and you aren't lying to them.

lol, sometimes I feel like I should run a class or something.  Too many people fell way into that game shit and forgot to be human beings.  Sometimes you just need someone to check your bullshit and make you act like a human being.  Not tell you secrets on how you can game the system.


edit- having re-read this scroll of text, it can basically be summed up with one word.  Empathy.  Practice empathy for your fellow human being.  Before you engage them, imagine what brought them there and how their day to day is.  Who they are.  And than go see how far off the mark you are.  for example, that group of people with one girl you want to from earlier.  Imagine you're hanging with your friends and someone tries to steal away one of your friends from the group because he's trying to get his dick wet.  You wouldn't like it, it'd be like, hey man we're trying to hang out here and you're fucking it up with your dick.  Or some attractive woman.  In high energy places she gets talked to all the time, but in low energy places like a store/library, most people are like you, terrified of her beauty, terrified that you aren't good enough to talk to someone like her.  So they ignore her.  In her world she's insecure like everyone else, she knows shes pretty so she highlights her good qualities by dressing well and being pretty.  That makes you and others even more scared of her.  When you shouldn't, she shits just like you and me.  She has insecurities like everyone else. 

 But also be honest and empathetic with your own feelings, and if you're just some average looking guy, know that you're in an uphill battle talking to that hot girl (tm).  But embrace that.  It's okay, if she rejects you, it's not the end of the world.  And maybe you can still be cordial and she will introduce you to one of her more available friends once you've shown her you're a good human being.  And remember, everyone fucked up in their own unique ways.  Nobody has their shit together 100%.  So don't put so much pressure on yourself to get an immediate result out of any single interaction with someone.  Life doesn't work that way and when it does, treat it for what it is, a unique and interesting situation that you can carry with you.

"(This subreddit is primed against BLM, but I figure I'll bite.)

I'm not necessarily disagreeing with you, but I can see it both ways. I mean, I get why people who just want to go enjoy the tree lighting with their family get annoyed with the perceived ""hijacking"" of the event. Hell, I get annoyed when walking behind someone walking marginally slowly... so my tolerance level for things ""disrupting"" me is pretty damn low. So I get the annoyance, I do.

But on the other hand, if you were part of a group that felt (even tangentially) continually threatened by and discriminated against by the police, and any discussions or attempts to reconcile the issue in the public discourse or governments seemed to have been largely marginalized for decades... wouldn't at some point you just get fed up?

I mean remember the way this subreddit exploded over Cynthia Whitlatch? Or that one cop who wrote all those pot tickets like he was the anti-marijuana batman? It's not like any of us can't empathize with what we consider ""unfair"" policing. All I'm saying is that if I was part of a minority group that felt that the criminal justice system for *decades* was set up to dehumanize and incarcerate me - or worse - I think I'd probably be pretty upset. Certainly to the point where I'd think forcing a dialogue (regardless of the method) was more important than keeping some people's Black Friday shopping experiences pleasant.

I'm not saying violence is right, or that the protesting is right, or *even that it's an effective delivery mechanism of the message*. I don't know if it is, and I'm not interested in promoting or condemning the actions of the movement. It certainly hasn't been well received in this subreddit. But I can certainly *understand* where the movement comes from and why it exists, even in a town that doesn't necessarily have the same history as Chicago or St Louis or New York.

The situation sucks honestly. I just don't think it's as black and white (heh) as this subreddit tends to make it out. It's awful that the officer was injured and property was damaged. It's genuinely sad that a lot of families' day was probably ruined. It's also sad to me that the people on the other side feel so disenfranchised that they feel it necessary to conduct these protests.

(And to answer a reply I know will come... this is hardly the first attempt at solving this issue either locally or nationally. This is a decades old issue that seems to have reached another boiling point. You may think that there are other strategies for fixing the problem, and you may be right, but BLM definitely didn't start in a vacuum.)",,,,jsep,North Delridge,,1448674514,t5_2qhad,t3_3uiwmk,t1_cxf9d4i,107,1450073806,0,0,cxfaieb,Seattle,107,,flair

Too many short, nationally syndicated stories that I could get anywhere else.

They have the perfect outlet and means to do some substantial, local coverage but chose not to.

Most galling is the fact that they plan to use pledge money to make this deal. Say goodbye to future donations, KUOW!

"Yes, second this.  You might want to look at Rainier Beach as well.  I'll point out one thing though - the way Seattle sets their school boundaries is a little odd. You can end up with a ""2"" school next to a ""10"" school so you don't necessarily have to live and work in a 'bad neighborhood' to work with disadvantaged kids.  

Madison Park, probably the wealthiest neighborhood in the city has one of the worst performing elementary schools with the most socioeconomically disadvantaged children.  Over where I'm at in NW Seattle my neighborhood school (North Beach) is in the 97% state wide, but the next school over  in the fairly upscale Broadview neighborhood is Viewlands, which typically has one of the highest % of free lunches in the entire city and abysmal test scores in the 25% range.

"A few thoughts:

1. This murraysville facebook thing has been discussed on /r/seattle before: https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/3o0bez/welcome_to_murraysville_a_place_to_chronicle/ . I honestly don't care for it, or the whole ""don't tell ballard to shut up"" petition. Both seem to frame things for yelling rather than conversation.

2. I live close to the ballard market street encampment. The unofficial squatters that were here last week frankly sucked (heard plenty of yelling/noises at night - it didn't make home feel like home). Thankfully that's been removed as of monday and the official stuff is finally being setup. I'm cautiously optimistic about the whole thing - homelessness is a hard problem and if this is the best solution let's try it. My only concern at the moment is the noise level at night.

"EDIT: asked my Muslim students today outright about Al-Shabab, ISIS, Al Queda, and everyone one of them said they are not Muslims. They are Haram (immoral, forbidden).

The fact you're asking questions tells me (though who the fuck am I?) you're nowhere near a bigot, thanks for asking.

* Do refugees assimilate well? 

It's hard to generalize but a good rule of thumb is the younger they are, the better they assimilate and the more they want to assimilate. I'm talking anyone up to about 40 years old honestly. Kids from 0-18 want NOTHING more than to be American. 18-35 are torn between their culture and their future. The folks over 40 have a much much harder time.

* Do they learn English? 

I'm actually a part time English teacher to refugees and from my experience? Absolutely. English is their key to jobs, to money, to anything resembling the American dream. Without English they know they'll be second class citizens and, again, it's really the older folks who struggle to learn it. 

* How many are employed? 

Employment is every single (can't emphasize this enough) refugee's main goal. Plain and simple. Anything from homecare work to truck driving to working in Alaska for 6 months, 12 hours shifts, 6 days a week. Employment is always the #1 goal for a variety of reasons, mostly involving the high cost of living in most cities that they live in.

* How many use welfare services and do they ever come off of welfare? 

Most if not all start out on some form of welfare, there's no way around it. It can take a little while for them (again it depends who you're talking about: Iraqis can get a job like that, while Somalis have a much higher hill to climb) to learn enough job-related English for any company to even give them an interview. 

* Are they sympathetic to political Islam? 

I work with mostly Muslims and they're all running away from the people you (perhaps) think they sympathize with. That's the whole reason why they're here. Because Al-Shabab and ISIS are literally in their backyards, planting landmines where their kids used to play, killing off their relatives for being ""sympathizers"" to the U.S. I can't speak for every refugee, obviously, but every one that I've talked to fears groups like ISIS more than me or you could ever possibly imagine.

* Do they criticize America? 

They get mad at me when I criticize America. So... Not really. They wish it was easier to find work (it's very difficult), but otherwise America has given many of these people a new lease on life that they will never forget. To answer your question more directly: besides not being so hot on gay marriage and weed, they love it here, and they'd like nothing more than to be accepted and to work.

* Are they all good genuine people?

I love this question because it was the first lesson I learned when I started working at my job. Basically, the funny thing is, refugees are just people. I'm not being glib, there are some assholes, there are some amazing ones. But most are just respectful and trying to survive.

"Not all changes like these are actually intended to improve overall traffic throughput or reduce travel times on those specific routes. Incentivizing bus riding, carpooling, and other means of travel improves traffic all over town, even if it's worse at times on the section that has the new lanes. Cities that blindly work to increase traffic throughput find that traffic tends to almost immediately increase to fill the void, and they're back where they started, with exciting new bottlenecks elsewhere. It can often actually make traffic worse as a result.

I have no idea whether it is successful at its goal, or whether it will eventually be, but the people who make these decisions aren't complete idiots.

"**I am genuinely interested in a response to these points from anyone who is upset by these protests. Please, I really want to understand your mentality.**

A. Laws regarding things like J walking and blocking streets were actually lobbied for by the automotive industry. The public never decided that they shouldn't be able to walk in the street as had been the norm pretty much forever. Its only because corporate interests decided that roads should be free of pedestrians and cities designed around cars that people now believe society decided that instead. You've lived it your whole life so you assume it was a well thought out plan rather than a way to increase profits and desirability of automobiles.

http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-26073797

B. US citizens have the right to protest their government without permits and the government's permission. As a response to the protests of the 60s the government now arrests protesters who aren't doing anything illegal (see Iraq war protests, occupy, etc) and also doesn't charge them with a crime. In the 60s a black person could protest, get arrested, and go to court to argue their case. Now protesters are arrested, left in jail 24-48 hours, and then released without charges. They never get to make a case yet their protest has been effectively silence by the police illegally arresting them.

Second amendment:

&gt;Right to keep and bear arms

&gt;A **well-regulated** militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed. 

&gt;Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Petition

&gt;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or **the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.**

There is nothing that isn't peaceful about standing in the street in assembly to petition the government. Nothing. Interference and disobedience are not violence. There is no mention in the bill of rights about a ""well regulated freedom of speech"" as there is with the second amendment.

From the ACLU:

&gt;Q. Do I need a permit before I engage in free speech activity?
&gt;A. Not usually. However, certain types of events require permits. For example:
&gt;A march or parade that does not stay on the sidewalk, and other events that require blocking traffic or street closure
&gt;Many permit procedures require that the application be filed several weeks in advance of the event. **However, the First Amendment prohibits such an advance notice requirement from being used to prevent protests in response to recent news events. Also, many permit ordinances give too much discretion to the police or city officials to impose conditions on the event, such as the route of a march or the sound levels of amplification equipment.**

This being a protest in solidarity of recent news events exempts it from the permitting process as its not timely.

https://www.aclu.org/know-your-rights/what-do-if-your-rights-are-violated-demonstration-or-protest?redirect=know-your-rights/demonstrations-and-protests

C. Why the hell is everyone more concerned about a 10 minute traffic delay than our constitutional rights? Go review American history and you'll find that almost every successful protest in America violated the law. American labor literally burnt factories to the ground, tore up railroads, etc. This is why you even have a comfortable life today because your ancestors decided that following the rules is stupid if the rules are being made to hurt you. Letting the police tell you its illegal to protest, that you must get a permit, that you have to keep moving, that you can't be loud, that your signs are too offensive, etc. Its ridiculous. City and state laws about blocking traffic or getting permits to protest do not trump the bill of rights. The more people convince themselves that all laws are more important than laws in the bill of rights the shittier your life is going to get. It doesn't even matter if the supreme court says you're not allowed to protest anymore.

The American government is under the American people, you do remember that, right? Does anyone remember the Boston Tea Party? American history is aboslutely full of stories where the people said, ""Fuck You"" to the government and broke all kinds of serious laws and it was the only way anything changed.

&gt;The IWW first attracted attention in Goldfield, Nevada in 1906 and during the Pressed Steel Car Strike of 1909[18] at McKees Rocks, Pennsylvania. Further fame was gained later that year, when they took their stand on free speech. **The town of Spokane, Washington had outlawed street meetings, and arrested Elizabeth Gurley Flynn,[19] a Wobbly organizer, for breaking this ordinance. The response was simple but effective: when a fellow member was arrested for speaking, large numbers of people descended on the location and invited the authorities to arrest all of them, until it became too expensive for the town.** In Spokane, over 500 people went to jail and four people died. The tactic of fighting for free speech to popularize the cause and preserve the right to organize openly was used effectively in Fresno, Aberdeen, and other locations. In San Diego, although there was no particular organizing campaign at stake, **vigilantes supported by local officials and powerful businessmen mounted a particularly brutal counter-offensive.**

More than 100 years ago this exact same tactic was being used by your ancestors. You should all be ashamed of yourselves if you consider yourself an American and yet demand that these protestors be punished for breaking trivial laws that are designed to stiffle the bill of rights.

"A couple of things: 

Naveed Afzal Haq was actually a Christian, converting in 2005, with the shootings occurring on July 28, 2006. According to his Bible Study leader, ""Haq converted because he perceived too much anger in Islam and wanted to find a new beginning in Christianity."", so to call him an Islamic Terrorist is simply not true. While he did say that he was a ""Muslim American"" during the shootings, the death penalty was not sought by the prosecution due to a history of mental illness. 

When it comes to Ali Muhammad Brown, he did admit that his motivations were based on his faith, purely for retaliation for the US' involvement overseas. Interestingly though, when Frank Silva Roque, who said he was ""going to go out and shoot some towel-heads"" on 9/11, murdered Balbir Singh Sodhi, a Sikh, a couple of days later, his defense attorneys argued he was insane because he heard voices telling him ""Arabs were satanic"".

So if you still want to say that the acts of a select few individuals represent the will and motivation of an entire faith, nationality or ethnicity, then that is your right. Keep in mind that both of your examples had a history of mental illness much like many non-muslim mass shooters in recent years

If I choose to apply your logic to attacks on the basis faith, should I arm myself against Chrisitians based on our example of Mr. Haq and the following: 

-Larry McQuilliams, who shot up Austin last year, was following a Christian ideology.
-Paul Jennings Hill, who murdered Dr. John Britton and James barret in 1994, said he would receive a ""a great reward in Heaven""
-Eric Rudolph, the 1996 Olympic Park Bomber claimed a Christian motivation for his attacks.

What I take away from this is that I should not judge others based on the actions of those who share their faith. The incidents you speak of are not simply 'Islamic Terrorism', any more than the examples above are 'Christian Terrorism'. This dangerous and xenophobic logic dictates that I should also feel the need to arm myself against Christians too. I do not, because I know the actions of a few do not reflect the views and motivations of the many.

"Call me a softie but I like that you're dreaming big. 

If you are interested in going directly from high school to college and finishing in 4 years, this sort of move could definitely slow down that time line. I moved out of the house at 17 and put myself through school at UW. It took me 6 years, because sometimes I didn't have enough money for the next quarter- but learning to be independent and working hard for my own goals is something I would never trade.

1. Look on Craigslist for a place with a roommate, try to find a room around $500/month. I lived on about $1000/month while
I was in school, it wasn't fancy living but it was fine. Check out /r/frugal for ways to stretch a dollar. food stamps help :)

2. UW has the ""husky promise"" which means tuition is completely covered for anyone who is eligible for the pell grant. However I was an instate student, so you might want to check if you are eligible as out of state.

3. Do not go to a 4 year university right away. Go to community college for at least 2 years to save some money. WA state institutions have a quota of community college transfers they must take so sometimes it's even easier to get in that way. North Seattle is nice and it would be cheap to live there. Seattle Central is in the middle of everything which would be fun, but living close by would be much more expensive.

4. If you really want to go to college here look up the current requirements to achieve ""in state"" status. When I was in school it was living here 2 years without being a full time student. If you can be considered ""in state"" it would make a world of difference, also it
would be nice to work and save a bit before you start school.

5. Once you're ready for a 4 year university UW of course is top notch for specific departments (engineering, business, nursing...) Western Washington University is also nice. It's up in Bellingham which is 2 hours from Seattle but only 1 hour from Vancouver.

This sort of thing will be hard, but hard in a way that I think is good for someone so young.

"This was the exact sentiment in 1997 about DSL. ""There is a monopoly and the free market will never upgrade it. The government must mandate it.""Then they said the same thing about @Home cable internet, and that without government mandates their monopoly would never lower prices or bring cable internet to anywhere except rich neighborhoods.Then they said the same thing when cable internet could only reach 20mb/sec and there is no incentive to increase speeds unless the government mandates it.And now, because streaming 1080p video on multiple devices while simultaneously torrenting is just too slow to live on, Century Link is upgrading to fiber internet because Google Fiber and other companies are threatening to move in, and people are still flipping shit saying the city government, the same city government whose stellar management ability has a multibillion dollar drill bit stuck under King Street, must start its own internet company or else speeds will never increase.------------------Internet speed has constantly gone up and price per Mb has constantly gone down.

"I think the Westboro Baptists found all sorts of times and places to 'protest' that allied most people against them. 

I'm not drawing a comparison between them and BLM. I am commenting only on the idea that any time and place are appropriate. In the Westboro case, they were 'successful' in that they received all the media coverage they could have imaged but they also managed to align almost virtually all political parties and groups against them. I'm also get that what they were doing was more trolling than actual protest.

BLM has had a massive amount of media coverage. What they do with that will be interesting. Disrupting moves which are done primarily for media coverage may get less effective over time.

"That is a nice strawman you have there. It would be a shame if anything happened to it. Move Seattle is the largest transportation levy in Seattle history. It doesn't prevent ""[paving] over our parks and destroy our housing to make room for more cars"". Nor does it ""give people different choices on how to get around"". All of the coordinators already have transit service. It is a unaccountable giveaway. A vote of 2/3 of the city council and all of the money can be used to build a giant statue of Sarah Palin in Pioneer Square. 

The paving thing is also an interesting choice of words since so much of the money would go to repaving roads. 

If we are being asked the invest that kind of money, having a list that we can hold our elected officials to is important. It was good enough for the Parks levy and the School construction levy. Hell, even Sound Transit gives you a commitment list. 

Their section on ""oversight"" is a joke:

&gt;In addition, Mayor Murray’s Move Seattle Strategic Vision lays out specific metrics that will be used to track the Seattle Department of Transportation’s progress in fulfilling the core values of the vision to a safe, interconnected, vibrant, affordable, and innovative city. Examples of those metrics include annual rate of pedestrian collisions, percentage of potholes repaired within 3 days, and percentage of destinations within a ¼ mile of frequent transit.

Nothing about specific projects being completed. 

The city can do better. They can come back next year with a stronger package with real goals of projects they are going to complete. If they want a smaller levy just for maintenance, fine. But a big levy like this needs real commitments.

&gt; In an interview with NPR&amp;#039;s Morning Edition, the governor of Washington state publicly welcomed refugees, citing the inscription on the Statue of Liberty, warning fellow governors against &amp;quot;Fear,&amp;quot; and insisting that background checks minimize whatever risk the refugees may pose.

&gt; No fewer than 31 governors have taken steps to prevent refugees from being resettled in their states.

Their issue is popular enough that they have fairly broad support across the city, but it isn't popular enough to be the tipping point in getting more candidates elected to the city council.

So on their blog they start endorsing the candidates that are firmly in their camp.

It would make voting a nightmare, but it's early this morning, so I'm sure there is a away to make it easy that I haven't yet thought of. :)",,,,tannerz,South Lake Union,,1447858959,t5_2qhad,t3_3t9q8o,t1_cx4hw5q,11,1449875234,0,0,cx4jb9i,Seattle,11,,flair

"Vouchers expire the business day after the election, so you have plenty of time and a new $100-use-it-or-lose-it incentive to figure out a candidate or two to support sometime before then. Lots of folks can't afford to donate $100 for local elections but do pay attention to politics, (e.g. HS students, folks on disability, retired people, etc.) and some folks will *start* paying attention now that they can afford it. Seems to have worked that way in other cities at least. Considering turnout for Seattle is [a bit less than 1/3 this year](https://info.kingcounty.gov/kcelections/ballotreturnstats/default.aspx), I'm hopeful.

Also, if you've ever voted on the side of an initiative that was going your way in Seattle, but got sent the other way based on the rest of WA state, this measure could reduce the likelihood of that as Seattle voters will have an incentive that the rest of the state lacks.

"You're a coward. This is exactly the attitude the ISIS wants because you're pinning the entire blame on all Syrian and other Middle Eastern refugees simply because of few acts out the 100,000. Bin Laden wanted all Muslims to unite against the West and because of attitude like yours, it's exactly what he wants: making the Islamic refugees feel rejected by civilization (concept in which people are supposed to be tolerant, free, advanced, caring, etc) that they have no where to go but join the ISIS and be forced to fight for them for all eternity, making terrorism a lot more worse than it is.

Most of the Paris attackers were EU citizens, not the refugees, so we might as well ban the French and the Belgians from entering this country. Instead of standing up to American values and the ""Shining Hill"" thing that makes our nation great, you instead cave into the xenophoebic-mentality bullshit with no logical basis, which is what terrorism really is, sending a message around the world that we are close-minded and bigoted, which plays right into the hands of the ISIS and other terrorist organizations. Terrorism isn't just about an attack that cause mass innocent casualties for a political change, it's also about fear, and you're caving into that, which feeds into the terrorists and potential future terrorists' ego. You fear the Syrian refugees because you fear that some of the terrorists might blend into the Muslim refugee populace, even if it's very baseless and the chance of that is extremely low.

"One of the reasons why White Center has not been annexed by Seattle is precisely BECAUSE the area is a drain on resources. Right now, Seattle makes money selling electricity services in the White Center area as well as selling water to the local water utilities in that area.

I don't see Seattle changing that set-up UNLESS the tax base in the White Center area changes to the point that it makes annexation more attractive.

"I heard this from an auditor who worked with the WSDOT engineering departments, he said it was a clusterfuck.  Since most of audits are for technology companies, he said compared to other companies in Seattle, they are an example of government slack.   Long lunches, working less hours, etc.  He kept saying they would never be able to work in the private sector with the quality of work he seen and work ethics.

The disconnect from WSDOT to the working public seems to be at odds for years. The goals pages was remove from the WSDOT page when they started pushing up non-car commuter agendas, bike lanes, car pooling, reduction in cars.   

The transparency had to be removed when its obvious they are not representing the working public.

We are one of the largest growing areas in the US, and yet the roads have remained mostly the same for decades. The east side has seen the slow down of all arterials roads, hwy 9, 522, 167. 167 was the test project for tolling but they added lanes, as where 405 was a conversion of an hov lane.  

We all know the backup points, 520/522/90 merge lanes are backed up for miles every day.  Going through Bellevue when there are no express lanes from the Everett/Lynnwood/Bothell business parks and people living in renton and farther south.

"I'm a car-less person and I got my CPL (as CCL is called here) in order to preempt these questions; you can ride whatever public transport you like with a loaded (legal, natch) handgun with your CPL, including Taxis. Taxis, like all private property, can refuse to serve you if you're carrying, but if you find yourself in a Taxi and they don't want you to have a gun, you are, at worse, trespassing and not committing a weapons violation. As in all cases of trespassing, they'll ask you to leave voluntarily at first, and you should do that.  

One other side benefit of CPL is that it will eliminate a waiting period when you buy the gun. Without the CPL, you could be looking at two trips to West Coast Armory; the first to select the gun, and the second to pick it up.  I'm honestly not sure if you pay on the first one or the second.  I have bought guns at WCA and in each case, the transaction was over in 15 minutes thanks to my CPL.  

Without the CPL, I'd say do as the others suggest: carry it unloaded in your pannier, and in the very unlikely event your are stopped by the police and they have reason to search your pannier, you should let them know what they're going to find before they find it.  

Since you intend to carry concealed, though, save yourself a lot of potential trouble and get the CPL up front.  If you're a WA resident, it'll take less than 30 days, and cost you less than $60.  Go to the downtown SPD headquarters.  

I made copies of my CPL and laminated them for carry in my wallet; having the original isn't as important as having all its information on you when you carry, because nobody believes a piece of paper as much as the records at police HQ that back it up.

By the way, you can always buy in town; Precision Shooter is somewhere around 70th on Aurora (Greenlake area).  They weren't around when I bought from WCA, but I'll go there next time I'm shopping (although I see WCA has some Black Friday deals going down).  /u/PrecisionShooter also has some deals going on as you can see over in /r/WA_Guns.

* using community oversight for misconduct rather than having police decide what consequences officers face

* independently investigating and prosecuting police misconduct
* having the racial makeup of police departments reflect the communities they serve
* requiring officers to wear body cameras
