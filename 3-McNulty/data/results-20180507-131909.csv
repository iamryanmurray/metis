"I got to drag some suburban and drysider inlaws around on Link last weekend to get to UW for graduation.  The non stop complaints were quite educational.  Some odd things indeed, like the Capitol Hill train said it was headed to Tukwila / SeaTac when in fact it was headed to U-District, they rode in panic the entire 90 second journey.  Then it was the elevators weren't clearly marked.  Why does Capitol Hill's station split the elevators anyway, that seems strange.  Elevators were needed because one of our party had an infant/stroller and couldn't ride the escalators.

Then when we finally pull into UW and pop up next to Husky Stadium what is the response, is it woo hoo we made it that was cool thanks?  Nope!  The suburban drysiders saw the park-n-ride sitting there and said ""well we could just have drove straight here and parked.""

The whole point of staging this at home (Capitol Hill) then walking a short walk / riding to graduation was completely lost on them, at least two in my party were consistently complaining it was not a safe experience, they saw homeless people on Broadway ave and were in a constant state of near-freak-out.

Lessons learned.  East-dry-siders flip shit at downtown Seattle, they want nothing to do with transit, and if Seattle wants to have it Seattle better figure out a way to pay for it.

I thought I'd be doing us all a favor by introducing a batch of drysiders to our wonderful new Link.  Instead it just reinforced everything they hate about Seattle - it's big, it's full of scary people, the streets are a crime zone full of drugs, and the sooner they were back in their nice safe cars on I-90 east the happier they were.

You cannot con the dry side into paying for our subways.  It's pointless to try.  They live over there for a reason - they hate it here and hate our ways of life.  Even more than we might hate theirs, I am sad/sorry to say.

"Postmates is one of the worst companies I've ever worked for. It's basically exploitative slave labor that takes advantage of desperate and wannabe couriers.

I don't know if they're still doing this, but they advertised you can make $25 an hour. I never met anyone who hit that value, and you'd basically have to be delivering 10 jobs at the same time in that hour window plus getting good tips to even come close to that.

Which isn't a thing that happens, especially since almost no one tips above the base delivery fee because they're misinformed and think that the fee is the tip. And trying to stack more than 3 deliveries in an hour is almost impossible, and the opportunity for it nearly never happens because their app/software doesn't optimize for route at all. Their whole platform is designed to work against the rider and force them to take shitty runs and brutally compete against other riders.

"The most logical response will be to look for wood that has moisture damage. Look around at your houses siding and use your finger to prod at any suspicious looking places. If it gives, or worse, your finger actually breaks the surface, drill a hole through and fill the inside with boric acid. You'll know you hit paydirt if you pull out your drill bit and ants come pouring out. You can use compressed air, a straw, and a reservoir of boric acid powder as a makeshift hopper, and inject half a cup to a cup into that hole. Don't use on contact ant killer/repellant as it will only deter the ants and not kill them at the source. Give the boric acid a week or two to do its thing, and with a bit of luck you will have the entire colony killed.

I got there and they said they couldn't honor the deal because an incentive they used expired and since I didn't have a down payment they can't give it to me now, at this point the insurance was transferred and they claimed my trade-in was already gone so I was pretty hand-tied.

""Many very generous people have asked about donations to help restore the Bettie Page mural. We really appreciate the offer and have been so moved by the support we've received from the community. However, between our home insurance, the original artist, and volunteers, we think the cost of repair will be manageable. 

If you would like to give money, we ask that you please consider donating to the Rape, Abuse, &amp; Incest National Network (RAINN), which is an excellent non-profit focused on supporting victims of sexual assault. To us, the so-called feminists who slut shamed Bettie are part of the problem of perpetuating rape culture. The idea that a woman shouldn't be allowed to express her sexuality without consequences is disgusting and incredibly damaging. The link takes you directly to RAINN's donation page. 

Thanks again for the support. As one of my friends put it, it just goes to show that for every sucky person out there, there are hundreds more who are good and kind.

What if you know they got away with heinous crimes?  Is it still immoral to kill them then? 

Mind you, we're not discussing the law here, only morals.  Legally, Theft and Murder obviously need to be against the law.  ""They had it coming"" should never be a legal defense, but again, this is about morality, not law.  

Really, none of the ten commandments are valid.  They don't discuss any of these morals to any degree of depth.  No nuance, nothing.  That's not helpful.  They also leave out some major morals that modern society usually considers important:  Like do not rape, treat all humans as if they are human, no slavery, don't murder people with different religions, etc.

"*What do you like to do for fun? If I was homeless I would probably live in the library for most of the day reading books and surfing the Internet.*

Which is indeed much of what I do.

My short term plan is to add Amazon's Mechanical Turk to that daily round.  However, more immediately I have a story to write; if I can finish it in a week, it can appear soon, so that's an incentive.

*Are homeless people wary of trusting other homeless people? Does it take a long time to make friends with someone else who is homeless?*

Homeless people's wariness of each other is famous among sociologists, it's so well established.  The technical term is ""disaffiliation"", and it really weirds them out, because the standard thing downtrodden groups are *supposed* to do is unite against their oppressors, and we really don't.

That said, I don't think it's hard at all for homeless people to come to conclusions about each other.  There's someone whom I've disliked from day one, and someone else who's disliked me from day one; and there's the guy I mentioned in ""Stealing"".  We actually met because he was looking for cigarette butts in a doorway I was planning to sleep in that night, and I got on his case (in a rather entitled way that now makes me cringe to remember); but somehow, I think mainly because of his gregariousness, that led to a sort of minimal friendship, and quickly.

*How do you protect yourself against other homeless/people/weather?*

""Stealing"" is largely about my ""protections"", but they're only protections against theft; I don't really do much to avoid violence except choosing where I go.

Weather - well, there's a reason doorways are good.  Architects have responded to this by making doorways few and far between in newer buildings; the exceptions tend to hire security.  If Seattle gets completely replaced by new construction in the next ten years, it'll be a lot harder to be street homeless here.

"So here's the thing.  In a normal city, rents are a bit higher near the Subway / Tube / El Tracks / BART - Muni because guess what, you do have more demand, because in the city *you don't have to own a fucking car unless you want to*

This was true 40 years ago when my Grandparents lived like this in Rogers Park Chicago, blocks from the Howard El Station.  Neither of them drove or had owned a car for years.  It works out vastly in your favor when you don't have city fees, gas, upkeep, auto insurance.  Now it's true in Seattle, where at long last people are figuring out that cars are not required for daily life.  

The only time it's surprising is if your upbringing only included cul-de-sacs in suburbia or farm roads in exurbia or non-walkable neighborhoods in post-World-War-II street grids, then you think you can't live without a car, and you fall for arrogant useless clickbait like this serving of shit the Seattle Times is serving up, to meet their usual audience, the suburban mindset that only ever knew those useless sprawling street layouts suburbia created from the 1950s onward.

Another reason nobody talks about why these walkable areas get so expensive now that the cat's out of the bag and everyone wants back into the core city grids worldwide, is that our stock of walkable areas is massively down thanks to 50 years of building nothing but sprawl.

It's great we upzone, but it's never going to keep up with demand until we start ripping out streets in suburbia and replacing them with more walkable and transit-friendly street grid.  

Then your car becomes an upscale accessory rather than a required necessity.  Or, you pay more to keep a car parked in off street parking that also costs to own, but is there if you cannot possibly evolve to living life without a personal car.

It might be worth looking at where light rail in Lynnwood is going to land - I suspect the park and ride near I-5 - and start thinking really long term about redoing the street grid so people could actually not have to drive their cars to get to it.",,,,my_lucid_nightmare,Capitol Hill,,1467032898,t5_2qhad,t3_4q1htk,t3_4q1htk,32,1469326021,0,0,d4psc3u,Seattle,32,,flair

"Depends on what part of White Center.  But just so you know, it's one of the few parts of the city that doesn't have such a great rep.  If you're coming from St. Louis or Chicago, it's nothing, but there are a few sketchy parts if you're used to the rest of Seattle.  I'd especially avoid the 15-16 block of Roxbury late at night.  It's not that something bad is always happening there, but it sure seems like when bad stuff happens (shootings), it's there or near it.  In the day it's fine though. 

The thing is that White Center is unincorporated King County, it's not Seattle.  So SPD don't have jurisdiction and the thinly stretched King County Sheriff has to manage it all.  That's not going to last forever though, and there was recent talk of having Seattle incorporate the area.  

That said, like others have said, the area is full of good places to eat.  Nothing fancy but great pho and Mexican food, the Salvadorean Bakery, Queen Deli (Cambodian), and Zippy's, which a lot of people will say has the best burgers in Seattle.

"It's the Save Our Trails people out of Kirkland. ST acquired an old railway between Bellevue and Kirkland in preparation for ST3. Instead of letting it rot while waiting, ST turned it into a temporary trail with the idea of creating a passage that included train, bike, and pedestrian throughways. Think Burke-Gillman, but with light rail running parallel.

Save Our Trails doesn't want rail running through Kirkland at all, so they have been vehemently protesting ST3 with the alternative idea that running buses down 405 would be faster and more effective than rail (anyone who has had to travel on 405 has full permission to start laughing immediately) while also lauding the trail that was created *last year* as a bastion of the community.

"I've had a consistently decent experience at McMenamin's ever since I changed my expectations and approach. The secret is to adjust your experience based on the number of occupied tables: 

* one other party: find a table, approach wait staff, tell them you are sitting down right over yonder. Sit down. Wait five minutes for service before activating self-service mode below. 

* two tables: tough call. If the wait staff isn't visibly flustered, follow the procedure above with an extra two minutes of initial wait time. If you need to be somewhere later in the day, skip to self-service mode. 

* three tables. the staff will be overwhelmed and likely unresponsive, possibly huddled in a stress ball behind the bar. Proceed directly to self-service mode. 

* four or more tables. Conduct search and rescue operation to locate staff. If none are located, the restaurant is likely closed--the waitstaff simply forgot to lock up the night before. Return on another day. 

Self-service mode: Find a table. Approach each wait staff and inform them you are have entered their domain to consume food and beverages, emphasizing you have come in peace with no unreasonable demands, including requests for water, condiments, or custom orders. Point to your table and tell them you are proceeding to sit down, where you will be ready to order when they navigate the minefield of tabletops. Back away slowly. Sit down and collect orders from the table, then proceed to the bar. Order directly from the bartender--grabbing a pint to take back to the table--or, if the bartender is missing, approach a wait person wherever they might be lurking (again, check the floor behind the bar) and gently guide them to a register.

Please enter the following items into the register...[list the beverages in a slow, monotone voice--ask them to read it back to you twice]. You did good...real good. We're almost finished...just a few more seconds and you can go back to wrapping utensils in napkins. Yeah, I like napkins too. OK, get your finger ready--this'll be easy. Enter the following items [same routine]. You're done. Thank you for your service."" 

Return to your table. The ketchup will be empty, so swap it with one from another table. Missing a place setting? You'll find them at the bus station. If the order was placed correctly, you should get your food fairly quickly, delivered by someone you've never seen before, possibly a customer who happens to know their way around a commercial kitchen. When you're meal is complete, leave cash, exact change when possible. Note that the wait staff that took your order will likely approach and ask if you're ready to order. Tell them you need another minute, and proceed to the nearest exit. Your McMenamin's dining experience is complete.

"You can't ""fix"" being homosexual or transgender because it's not a problem in the sense that being fat is a problem.  Unless you are in the tiny, tiny minority of people who can't lose weight even with monumental effort (and unless you have one of a handful of diseases, you are not in this grouping of people), you can fix being fat by not being lazy, fixing your diet, exercising more, and generally changing your lifestyle.  For 99% of people, it's a willpower and effort problem, not a medical issue you can ""fix"" with sufficient effort.

There are very few fat people I genuinely feel bad for, because for them being fat isn't something they can control.  Type 1 diabetics have a nearly impossible chance at properly controlling their weight due to requiring a mandatory minimum of carbs that goes up or down depending on blood glucose.  People with pituitary disorders (causing massive weight gain) or PCOS (also causing massive weight gain, only solvable by removing the ovaries) are also people that have legitimate medical issues preventing weight control or weight loss.

2. Lunchbox Laboratory. Pretty cool place, I thought the burgers were pretty meh.  Fun place to have an overpriced lunch though. My final visit I was feeling pretty good after some hiking, we stop there and I order a pricey $11-12 cocktail.  The waitress goes out of her way to ask me if I want to make it a double.  ""A double? Sure!""  Why not add a little kick to my sweet, overpriced cocktail?  She neglected to tell me that making it a double, DOUBLES the price!  I got a fucking $24 drink that was like, okay.

You guys like to huddle around this idea that /u/careless is the only one attacked by your brigading and manipulation, but that's not true.

"It's more like Alaska is and has been the local leader at SeaTac, and Delta is trying to push them out. I personally have always been a fan of Alaska and I continue to fly with them domestically. 

* Connectivity: Delta is a bigger company and most likely flies to more locations in the lower 48, but Alaska certainly flies nonstop to all the major destinations (I think Nashville and Charleston, SC were their latest nonstop additions). It's *great* for the west coast, especially now that they are purchasing Virgin America.

* Cost: Don't quote me on this, but I think part of Delta's strategy to shoehorn itself into the Seattle market is to lower prices, which it can afford more easily due to its size. Expect to fly through Atlanta though, even if it's completely out of the way (e.g. Seattle &gt; Atlanta &gt; Chicago)

* In-Flight Experience: I haven't flown with Delta in years, so I have no idea if it's improved, but just based on what I know, Alaska has a superior level of service and at least seems to care about their customers a whole lot more than Delta does.

* Card: again, I've only had Alaska's card, but I like it a lot. 1 mile per $1 spent (2-3 miles per $1 spent on Alaska airfare).

In Seattle, homeless services seem to have grown. I do know that Mayor Murray and other local officials talk about federal funding for affordable housing being cut over the years, and that being a driver of the homelessness crisis.

In terms of visibility, some people believe all the development in the city has left people on the street with fewer places to tuck themselves away. That may be contributing to an increase in people sleeping in tents in plain view.

"I object to this because Pharmacists are licensed professionals -- not licensed technicians. They are required to have professional licences not occupational licenses. As professionals they are obligated to NOT fill prescriptions that they believe are harmful to the patient or society. Just as lawyers are obligated to decline representation of clients they are unable to provide excellent advocacy.

Maybe the doc gets the prescription wrong? Maybe the patient has an observable drug abuse problem? Maybe Dr. Evil is over prescribing? Maybe the drug is sourced or tested using objectionable/immoral but legal methods. Maybe the Pharm thinks parents should be notified before filling a birth control pill prescription for a minor?

These are decisions that professional Pharmacists have to make everyday. We (at least me anyway) want them to have the agency to object to a doctors prescription for any reason they feel is valid. If you take that away they are not professionals -- only technicians. 

However, I would withdraw my objection if Pharmacists were ""demoted"" to techs without professional licensing just occupational licensing. Then they could fill scripts blindly without liability. Let the docs eat the liability while Pharm techs  automatically (e.g., as if they were automatons) issue the pills. We could eventually have automatic vending machine type dispensers. 

Besides, getting rid of Pharmacists altogether would save some coin.

"In case anyone is curious, here's some of the response to this allegation, found at: http://www.seattlemet.com/articles/2016/5/11/african-american-and-jewish-foiled-job-candidate-complains-of-discrimination-at-jayapal-campaign

&gt;The Jayapal campaign’s lawyer, longtime Seattle labor attorney Dmitri Iglitzin, reiterated Bly’s point that working on Saturday’s was “essential to perform the job of supervising canvassers.”

&gt;“Saturday is the most important day of the week,” he said, when it comes to political campaigning.

&gt;“The claim that someone’s religious beliefs are not being accommodated is something the campaign takes very seriously,” Iglitzin said. “Unfortunately, it’s clear that in this case, working on a Saturday is an essential job function. Therefore his claim has no merit.”

&gt;Sort of like hiring a pharmacist who won’t dispense Plan B, hiring a political field organizer who cannot work on Saturdays could be seen as an “undue hardship” on the employer.

&gt;Iglitzin also vehemently objects to Yisrael’s claim that he would have been treated differently if he had been white, calling the accusation “baseless”  and “offensive.”

&gt; “All field directors need to work on Saturday,” he said. The requirement of working Saturdays “isn’t something we made up,” Iglitzin said, making the point that the Saturday work requirement—spelled out all along in Jayapal’s field organizer training documents— wasn’t some handy excuse they conjured up out of nowhere to target and discriminate against Yisrael.

This might also be of some interest, from the same source:

&gt;Yisrael’s email ends with a threat, asking for six months severance: 

&gt;“By 1pm tomorrow May 6th, 2016 you will contact me with an offer of an acceptable severance package that covers at least the next 6 months.

"&gt; Next time Metro needs to take a lane from general traffic

YSK: Metro doesn't decide one way or the other.  It is *always* the city with jurisdiction over the street that says yes or no on bus lanes.  So, in addition to hassling Metro for better service (include your King County Councilmember on the note), tell SDOT that you want it, too.  SDOT not only manages the streets, they also buy service hours from Metro (thanks to the 2014 Proposition 1 vote) so they can go to Metro and say ""this route needs 15,000 more annual service hours, here is a bag of cash"" if there is room in the budget, in addition to saying ""oh and here's a bus-only lane for you as well.""

Note that this is why the bus-only lanes on Aurora is so odd, especially on the southern end near the bridge.  A well-heeled landowner down there flipped her shit when Metro asked Seattle to make the bus lanes all-day and then flipped slightly less of her shit when Seattle said ""yes to bus lane but only 6a-9a and 3p-7p"" so the SB segment is 6a-9a only.

"Which is funny, because to me it reads like a completely toothless attempt at reform that still leaves the SPD with virtually no external oversight.

This isn't about whether or not police should use force - it is about putting the power to judge whether or not an officer's actions were justified in the hands of someone who isn't one of his fellow officers.

Police tend to develop an ""us vs them"" mentality that makes anyone in uniform an ally and everyone else the enemy. They see themselves as brothers in battle against a hostile outside world. Historically, people in this position do not enforce the rules upon their brothers, and you don't have to look hard to find examples of police that outright declare that loyalty to their fellow officers is a greater priority than upholding the law.

As for what they ""get in return"", why should we have to bribe our own police force to get proper external oversight? If the police need a pay raise because of a climbing cost of living, let's give it to them. If they need better retirement benefits because life expectancy has increased, let's give it to them. We should pay what it costs to adequately compensate our police force because that is what is fair and right, but we should not have to be trading money for oversight over a department that the public created, funds, and (nominally) controls.",,,,Emberwake,Queen Anne,,1466630727,t5_2qhad,t3_4pcal6,t1_d4jvg02,18,1469225020,0,0,d4jy89s,Seattle,18,,flair

"State law limits the taxes and amount of taxes that can be levied by municipalities. Sound Transit is a special case in that the State has explicitly given them special taxing authority within the [ST Regional Taxing District boundaries](http://www.soundtransit.org/rta), though within the same legislation the Legislature put a cap on the tax rate that ST is allowed to collect. Twice now ST has had to go back to the Legislature asking for permission to raise the ceiling so they can build more shit (for ST2 and the upcoming ST3).

The State also gave municipalities the option to form a transportation benefit district (TBD) which creates a quasi-municipal corporation that allows municipalities to raise tax a bit beyond the normal state cap in order to build more transportation improvements. Seattle formed the [Seattle Transportation Benefit District](http://www.seattle.gov/stbd/) in 2010 and as of today uses it to buy more bus service from Metro. It's great for buying more bus service hours, but it's practially useless for building more light rail.

Seattle actually *does* have enough taxing authority to build light rail on its own thanks to the State giving it such authority through the creation of the [City/Century Transportation Authority (CTA)](http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=35.95A&amp;full=true). This authority was bequeathed upon the city so that it could build the expandad monorail system. Unfortunately pro-monorail/anti-light rail people got provisions inserted in the legislation that explicitly forbids its usage for a light rail system.

So the only taxing authority that Seattle has to be able to pay for light rail on its own is through the regional Sound Transit agency, and all funding through ST has to be done commensurate with funding throughout the whole ST region (most of King County, and a fair bit of Snohomish and Pierce). **There's currently no other way for Seattle to fund light rail under state law**, and of course the State does fuck all to help fund it either.

"Well, you're starting from the right place:  it really isn't your personal responsibility.

One trivial thing y'all could do is get some flyers the city puts out about services for various groups - men, women, veterans, etc.  If you ever go by the Urban Rest Stop, there are usually examples to the right of the door as you walk in.  When I notice that they've been updated, I usually take two for men and one for women, and give away two of them within a few weeks.

This sounds callous - ""Hey, I'm asking for help with my life, and you're giving me a piece of paper!"" - but the thing is, the people listed on that piece of paper *are* professionally interested in helping, *have* knowledge and resources with which to do so, and so on.  They probably won't actually get him on his feet, but they're going to have a better chance of doing so than you will.

The other thing that comes to mind is that your office's bathroom sounds like a *good* resource.  It may well be that your co-workers don't want people like me thinking that; and while telling everyone to take a hike would make the world a bit darker for people like me, it would be a consistent policy.

"You're not going to see quite the atmosphere that you get at Sounders games because of the inflated cost of Copa America tickets. For example, I've paid $20 for multiple tickets in section 120 before (south end behind the goal) for Sounders games. A cursory look at StubHub is showing those tickets going from anywhere from $130 to over $400.  Section 113, east side near the top of the area, I've paid about $30 for; those are going for minimum of $170.  My friend has Sounders season tickets in section 137 for $46 per match; those are also going for $170 minimum.  

Atmosphere is going to be family-friendly.  People will be excited and loud, but there's going to be no 'Us vs Them' or 'We Came to Drink We Came to Sing' or pre-game claps or anything else that makes games at Clink so special.

Edit: I saw that the number of tickets sold as of this morning was only around 42000, well under the record for Sounders.    This freaking tournament, man.

Seattle used to be the sort of town that wrote a lot of jaywalking tickets...cited a lot of drivers for blowing through occupied crosswalks &amp;c.

Except they weren't flipping for Bernie because Bernie was a lifelong socialist who had just registered as a Democrat and almost none of them were willing to support him over someone who had been a Democrat all their life. 

Somehow his supporters thought it was a good idea to harass or shame super delegates via twitter, facebook, email, voice mail and eventually in person. 

It gets worse when Clinton starts to rack up major endorsements from individuals like civil rights leader John Lewis.  Suddenly his twitter and Facebook are flooded with hateful messages and Bernie doesn't  say a damm thing about it.

B. Plaintiffs’ Article I, §7 privacy challenge
Art. I, §7 of the Washington constitution provides “No person shall be disturbed in his private affairs, or his home invaded, without authority of law.” This language has been held to be qualitatively different from, and more protective than, the Fourth Amendment. State v. Hinton, 179 Wash.2d 862, 868, 319 P.3d 9 (2014). A court analyzing a privacy claim applies a two-part test. State v. Surge, 160 Wash.2d 65, 71, 156 P.3d 208 (2007). First, the court must determine whether the state action constitutes a disturbance of one’s private affairs. Second, the court must determine whether the intrusion is authorized by law. York v. Wahkiakum Sch. Dist. No. 200, 163 Wash.2d 297, 306, 178 P.3d 995 (2008).

I don't agree with you on the terminology of us living in a massive bubble up here, which implies that real asset prices are artificially above their fair value.

True that there seems to be a higher proportion of foreign buyers here right now, which is helping to fuel demand - but remember that almost every home sale in this market (if fairly priced to value) has seen a much higher than average number of bids.  The foreign buyers just happen to be winning a lot more of the bidding wars because to a seller, C.R.E.A.M. - most locals looking to buy have budget constraints and price ceilings that they can't go above, whereas in a highly competitive market the foreign buyers looking to extract money out of their home country just keep re-raising everyone like the chip leader at a poker table.  I would be more than willing to bet that if the foreign buyers didn't have so much ""F*CK YOU"" cash money to invest here (for argument's sake, let's just assume that there were no foreigners buying homes here) you would still see an abnormal supply demand balance with higher than mean price appreciation just simply because of the demographics in the region and the general health of the economy.",,,,PM-ME-UR-BEST-WHATEV,,,1467131955,t5_2qhad,t3_4q9n9p,t1_d4ra71v,14,1469353419,0,0,d4rdk3j,Seattle,14,,

And they shall spread the cloth before the elders of the city. ...

Christianity is just as messed up as Islam, the major difference is that most modern Christians ignore the nasty parts of their holy book.

"The stadium transit area and parts of SODO in general is really sketchy, and even when it's not it still feels sketchy.

If it makes you feel any better I'm a kind of grizzled, large and generally fearless old dude and I don't feel safe at all in that area in even in broad daylight.

It's like the architecture and remoteness and weird and bad pedestrian access jammed into an industrial district promotes craziness and a general unease above and beyond the usual levels of Seattle weirdness.

Something you can do is take actual self defense courses and generally embrace your inner badass - because that thing that feminists talk about how society teaches women to never be confrontational is a real and powerful thing.

And, yes, the path of lowest escalation and least violence is almost always best. To get away, to remove yourself, to deflect, yes. This is what Aikido teaches, as well as Tai Chi. How to confront without really confronting, but ready to defend and deflect.

But taking practicing some actual martial arts and/or a proper rape/assault defense class is something that you should totally do if you're feeling unsafe. It's not about responding to violence with violence or being a vigilante - it's more about being less afraid, more able to react, less likely to freeze or do nothing if actually attacked.

Because that practice and knowing ""I can actually totally bust that sick asshole's nose if he comes at me."" will actually help you feel more safe and more able to defend yourself and even call for help in the first place. (And you should totally yell and call for help, because not everyone is asleep at the wheel or not paying attention.)

And because - to borrow an idea from SF author Neal Stephenson - you are at the top of the evolutionary chain.

You are the newest model and the end product of thousands and tens of thousands of generations of apes turning into humans.

Which means you're a stupendous fucking badass. Even if you don't know it. And as the newest model, it's worth it to be able to defend yourself.

You're young. You're probably fast and raised on tech and have great spatial reasoning skills and reflexes. You know what right and wrong is, and you obviously don't like being wronged - and, well, you can actually do something about it when and if and whenever you want to.

And you can do it safely, confidently - even if your choice in the response is walking away, telling them to call their mother or go fuck a cactus, directly and promptly kicking their ass and/or dragging them to the cops...

...or simply pressing charges, or quietly filing a report so they have to pull any tape and make note of the guy to build a case. In case he does it again. (And if you have time, you should do this, too. Don't let the officers talk you out of it. You can insist on filing a report. It helps if he does it again.)

And by taking at least one rape/assault defense class or practicing a  decent martial art for a little while, or longer - you can start to figure out how much of a badass you can be.

reddit is built on the core idea that users can upload content from around the web and the users would vote that content up and down. it's built into the idea of the website  from the ground up. our wonderful moderator has taken it upon himself (themselves) to build a set of rules and guidelines to limit content and discussions to what they deem acceptable. bans, warnings, deletions, and angry replies quoting rules (that are unchangeable by the users) are all that are given. there is no way to change the moderation team or affect removal of moderators in any way. hundreds on hundreds of passionate posts over months/years asking for the removal of aspects of the moderator team do nothing, falls on deaf ears, or pushed aside with comments about brigading alternative subs and doxing. no real absorption of the core problem. by restricting content to a few seemingly select few approved content providers moderators are stifling people's ability to post and share a wide array of content from a variety of places. everything falls under  spam/marketplace/personal project/whatever filters overly restricting to a degree that is not necessary.

so with that as the foundation of acceptable use around here, enjoy your seattle times content. change is not allowed. dissent is not allowed. any discussion of those problems will be ignored. and god forbid if you link to a subreddit that careless does not like, because you'll be auto banned if you do.

"I just moved to Seattle a few weeks ago  I have lived in other large cities (San Diego and Chicago) and am completely shocked at the culture surrounding heroin in this city. I have seen people openly using in parks and on the street, have seen obvious deals go down, etc. I am a social worker and I have a very progressive attitude towards how drug epidemics of this sort could best be  combatted (holistic treatment/housing first approach as opposed to a punitive/cj system approach) and it seems like the city is working to implement more programs of that nature, which is awesome!  There also seems to be a fair amount of services in place to offer help. Although I suppose there are never enough. 
Anyway, the one thing that truly shocked me, even more than watching a person shoot up in public, was hearing a group of guys standing around on a busy downtown street full of pedestrians talking about their epic score over the weekend as if it were nothing. These guys -- mid-twenties, man-buns, expensive fixed-gear bikes, cleaned up and well-groomed -- didn't fit the stereotype of a transient heroin addict living in a tent under the freeway. These guys were typical, hipster millennials standing outside a bar talking about ""rigs"" and ""dabs"" just as loud and as jovial as if they were talking about slamming IPAs and ripping shots of Jamo over the weekend. 
I was so shocked. Maybe because these guys seemed so ""normal,"" which makes me hate that I can't escape my own stereotypical views of who must be or who cannot possibly be a heroin user. Would I have been shocked if I heard a different-looking crowd talking? A crowd that fit my idea of what a heroin addict/user looks like? 
Maybe the shock came from the joy these got from talking about their score. I mean, shouldn't they be hidden away in some dark alley talking in shameful whispers? Well, that's not cool, either. Living in shame is no way to get better. 
Wow. I kind of went on a rant there but that experience really opened my eyes to the widespread reach of the heroin epidemic and the culture surrounding drug use in this city. I also discovered that I have some judgement/stereotyping issues that I thought I was so above. It's a culture shock for me, but it's a great city with great people. My values and perceptions are being tested, and that's a good thing. ",,,,worthitnotsure,,,1465328681,t5_2qhad,t3_4n04ea,t3_4n04ea,-17,1468877552,0,0,d3zvao8,Seattle,-17,,

We never studied it much, because Christians and sex don't mix, but I do remember one minister doing a sermon on Song of Solomon, and how it exemplified the kind of passion a married couple (very important that they're married) should have. 

He started walking through the book, interpreting the verses to a modern understanding, and when he got to the verse ""Come with me from Lebanon, my bride. Leave Lebanon behind, and come."" he said that it was essentially the Biblical equivalent of ""I'm cumming, cum with me"", and a few people stormed out of the service.

"Change it by radically increasing demand and therefore traffic, you mean? Self-driving cars are obviously going to result in another exodus to the suburbs. Some people already deal with 2 hour commutes. A *lot* more will be willing to do so once you can take a nap or watch a movie while cruising along.

It's just another form of latent demand. We're already willing to put up with the current level of traffic (otherwise fewer people would drive, lowering the level of traffic until we hit the steady state condition). Even if self-driving cars increase the carrying capacity of roads -- something which is utterly unproven as of yet -- demand will increase to match. Probably *beyond* the traffic levels we already see, since, again, why not if you're asleep in the backseat?

"The main reasoning behind it being that many in the LBGT community have felt the topic about crimes and violence specifically targeted at gays that happens in america constantly is being pushed aside to focus on this mans religion, as if giving the other religious communities that preach and celebrate the death of people of the LGBT community that exist in the US a free pass because ""they aren't as bad"".

You can complain about parts of their culture also demonstrating this same hate, but the problem is that in the US it is still an accepted view and is allowed to fester and replicate, regardless of your religious affiliation. He may have learned the hate from his religion, but many do, the problem is that the hate isn't questioned and that it is allowed to grow in our communities. The fact is that regardless of who or what told you to hate gays, you are among friends in this country, friends that will foster and reinforce your hatred until it culminates in violence.

The amount of times I have heard ""They had it coming"" ""This was god's judgement"" ""It wouldn't have happened if they weren't gay/sinners"" is sincerely what I find horrendous, because it's that kind of dehumanizing mindset that allows stuff like this to happen.

"There's something no one is addressing on the thread - the Police don't work a typical schedule.  Most of them aren't commuting during regular commute times.   Police officers work 4 9-hour days on, 2 days off.   First watch is 3 am to 12 am, second watch is 11 am to 8 pm, and third watch is 7 pm to 4 am.   Good luck catching a bus to work at 3 am or a bus home at 4 am.   Because the schedule is 4 days on and 2 days off, the officers will rotate through holidays and weekends when buses are also infrequent or even non-existent depending on the route.

The police also need to have extra space if there is an event or situation involving a all-hands-on-deck requirement.   And this station is also being designed to serve a denser, more highly populated city in which more officers will be needed.    The site could also serve as an emergency command center if earthquakes cause damage at other locations.   There will also be a firing range in the building that off-duty officers will be able to use to keep up their skills or to recertify.

Having children in the city takes more resources (flexibile time or money) than in other locations and this is why many people wait until their careers are established before having children.

I think your location might be a problem. In a neighborhood with less money, you'd likely be able to find a stay at home parent who'd agree to care for your child before or after school and on the (many) half days and school holidays.

"Yes, ability to rent short term may become more limited. Earlier this month, Seattle lawmakers proposed [new rules to curb Airbnb rentals](http://www.geekwire.com/2016/seattle-lawmakers-propose-rules-curb-airbnb-improve-housing-affordability/). Under the proposal, rental units that aren't within the landlord's primary residence can be rented out for only 90 days. If it is within the primary residence, the operator has no limit, but the owner does need to obtain a new ""short term rental operator"" license from the City of Seattle. Also, all property owners would have to provide:

* Liability insurance
* A local contact for guests
* Safety information posted in the home
* A declaration of compliance with safety codes

GeekWire reported that, ""The regulations are designed to discourage landlords from operating hotel-like businesses where they would otherwise provide long-term rentals for residents."" The [city says](http://komonews.com/news/local/seattle-proposes-regulations-on-airbnb-rentals) it will hold two months of public discussion on these regulations before a council vote in August or September.

"I'm the pretty clueless, misguided person working on this.

Will start by saying that there are many perspectives on how homelessness can or should be solved, and that GiveSafe is neither the solution to the root cause, nor is it building housing. I also know reddit is a smart community, where solid questions come up that I might not have the answer for yet.

Our approach is based off of this [London case study](http://www.good.is/articles/giving-money-to-the-homeless-might-actually-work), which showed that unrestricted financial resources + relational guidance could lead to incredible outcomes. It's also based on growing up in Chicago and being housing-insecure myself a couple times in life. We're focused on over 100 interviews of commuters who said they often encounter someone in need (not just panhandling), often want to help, but don't know how. Cash is an option, but some don't carry it, or don't give for fear of harming the individual. So if one isn't in that bracket, we probably wouldn't be of interest to that person.

GiveSafe doesn't take a cut of any contribution; we add a small fee to the **top** of every transaction to help cover processing and expenses. So if you gave $11, you might pay $11.80. The beacon holder gets $11 in value. They aren't restricted to just partnered merchants either. They can have a case manager apply the money to anything (like as a BOLT ticket, with whom we don't have a partnership). 

We're not a 501(c)3 nonprofit because we believe we can help more people faster without the extra overhead and restrictions of that entity. I might be wrong. It's important to remember that 501(c)3s attempt to maximize revenue too. It's just in the form of donations, where ours is ""baked in"" to what we do. Currently, I'm earning a fraction of minimum wage and am not an ex-micro/amzn with savings. [This kid](https://www.youcaring.com/andrei-villasana-387551) flew in from Texas to work this summer unpaid.

The beacon is used, for lack of a better term, as a ""gateway drug"" into agencies like New Horizons, YWCA, Facing Homelessness, MID and UGM. The monthly interactions we hope will pull people from the margins and into relationships with people who are there to help them. **This is the key outcome.** The contribution ability never turns off without a check-in, just that the funds are held until it happens. After a set amount of time (we're not sure yet, pretend a year) unused funds are split evenly among the shelters..

We want to make it easier to give, and to help a person suffering from homelessness find dignity, resources, and guidance to getting themselves back on their feet.",,,,koomboy,,,1466499347,t5_2qhad,t3_4p0rh0,t3_4p0rh0,10,1469187503,0,0,d4hruo9,Seattle,10,,

"When I was a lass, in the 1960s, Capitol Hill fit this description. The perceived blight of the Central Area crept over the color line of Madison. Many of its residents fled to the suburbs. How do you explain how the artists, gays, and other alternative types were able to move in in the 70s? 

What is now Pike/Pine, in the 1970s. I remember when lower Pike/Pine was considered a warzone, with all its sex shops, sleeze, and prostitutes walking the streets. What is now Tango was a porn theater. 

Ballard used to be decrepit old warehouses, industrial uses and elderly Scandinavians. My friend, an artist, rented the whole top floor of what used to be at first an SRO for sailors, then it became a whorehouse. The roof leaked, but there was a sink in every room - she used each room as a separate studio, one for oils, one for sculpture, etc.  That's how cheap Ballard used to be - that an artist could rent a dozen-room leaking-roof former whorehouse and be able to afford it.

Belltown still SROs and mostly drunks lolling on the sidewalks. All those trendy restaurants, and fancy high-rise condos did not exist. The Apex Co-op was started in the 1980s to try to preserve a little corner of Belltown affordability for those artists and other alternative folks who used to live there. 

The old Cascade neighborhood, now South Lake Union, used to have a lot of junkies. One time I went to the park just south of Mercer with my kids. My daughters were excited to try out a new park, so they ran ahead of me. There were a few children in the park already, and the first thing they did, is they came up to my kids and asked, ""Where's your grown-up? You shouldn't be in this park without your grown-up!"" At the time I thought it was interesting. The kids in the neighborhood recognized my kids as strangers, and immediately took on protecting them against the dangers that they knew were there. 

Columbia City is a neighborhood that has gone from scary to hip in a flash, too.

"Accepting cash can be a major pain, especially for things like medical expenses where bills are large and cash is rare. The system to do so (and properly give receipts, store it safely, prevent employee theft, deposit at the bank, etc.) is likely expensive, especially since most people don't pay for medical services in cash.

Here is what the Federal Reserve has to say about accepting cash.

&gt; There is, however, no Federal statute mandating that a private business, a person, or an organization must accept currency or coins as payment for goods or services.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/currency_12772.htm

And the Treasury:

&gt; This statute means that all United States money as identified above are a valid and legal offer of payment for debts when tendered to a creditor. There is, however, no Federal statute mandating that a private business, a person or an organization must accept currency or coins as for payment for goods and/or services. Private businesses are free to develop their own policies on whether or not to accept cash unless there is a State law which says otherwise. For example, a bus line may prohibit payment of fares in pennies or dollar bills. In addition, movie theaters, convenience stores and gas stations may refuse to accept large denomination currency (usually notes above $20) as a matter of policy.

"I am a little confused by your answer. The market in Seattle has gone up so dramatically in Seattle in the last eight years that rents have doubled and tripled. I write countless reasonable accommodations for disabled who have been given notice to move in 20 days because their rent has doubled and can't because they additional time to physically move, much less find a place that can accommodate them. This is a Landlord market at this time and they know it. In about 5 years when the building market has caught up, maybe the prices will go down and readjust, but until then you have people who are now homeless.

"First of all, Issaquah and Bellevue are about the same in terms of boringness. They're both suburbs. They both have some decent restaurants and a few good neighborhood bars, but for most fun stuff like concerts, ""going out"" bars, great restaurants, coffee shops, museums, pro sports, etc. are all located in Seattle. The one thing they definitely have over Seattle are closer to outdoor activities, quieter (could be a pro or a con), less sketchy/crazy people (could be a pro or a con), less traffic, in general just a slightly more laid back pace. Being suburbs, you're also more car dependent, but there are definitely spots you can live where most necessities are in walking distance.

So it really comes down to, IMO, Issaquah vs. Seattle. The commute is going to suck. You're looking at about 30 minutes to an hour each way. That might not seem too bad, but it quickly becomes pretty painful. If I were you, I'd live in Issaquah and just head into Seattle for activities. The commute is really miserable. You'll get more bang for your buck in terms of housing in Issaquah as well. I'd move to Issaquah if I didn't work in Seattle. It's just so much better for access to outdoor activities, which are a big part of my life.

One other point to consider. Are you single? Dating will be easier if you live in Seattle. Not to say it's not doable on the Eastside, but you have way more options in terms of both dates and date spots living in Seattle.

Last piece of advice: this subreddit hates the Eastside, particularly Bellevue, with an intense and irrational passion. A lot of people here will talk shit about these places but have never really spent any time there. Take any advice you get here with a grain of salt. I'd try crossposting in /r/eastside as well as you'll probably get more realistic views from people who actually live there instead of just hating on the eastside because ""it's the cool thing to do"".",,,,iwannabuyit,,,1467306782,t5_2qhad,t3_4qm7xc,t3_4qm7xc,38,1469402048,0,0,d4u72d7,Seattle,38,,

"Not to put up a massive stink...but...I live in the Seattle area. My partner has a seizure alert dog, which was alerting to seizures before two. The dog is not from an organization, he was originally trained to respond to seizures (laying on top of my partner to reduce his head hitting the floor and keep assholes from stealing his wallet/backpack again). Many dogs trained in this way (or simply extremely connected to their owner) will naturally begin alerting, which is exactly what our dog does. He warns my partner about 15-20 minutes before he has a seizure.

Our dog is completely committed to my partner, he has basically no interest in anyone else. However, I constantly fear leaving him outside of a store that he will be stolen. He wouldn't love going with someone...but he isn't aggressive and does not ever bark. He would be pretty easy to scoop up and drive off with. Luckily he looks like the brindle version of this dog so very few would have the courage to steal him.

Some dogs just see other dogs or people as threats for silly reasons like they are wearing a hat or are a different race or have a backpack on who knows, so a breed that tends to react violently to that vs a breed that runs away is more aggressive and dangerous.

"I make it clear that I am looking to cross by looking at traffic both ways and standing on the edge of the curb. When I'm particularly angry at all drivers, I will step out in the street and stare down specific drivers until they stop. If I am crossing a street with traffic, I don't do anything nonstandard like diagonal crossing. I want to be as predictable as possible.

Years later, we were working at the same place testing video games for a company which shall not be named.  It was kind of awkward.  But I said ""Hi"" and we had lunch together one time. No big deal.  I didn't ask about or mention the Playboy thing but I had heard about it.

"Well this will probably be voted straight to the bottom since r/seattle can't seem to handle dissenting opinions, but I'm voting against ST3 and will encourage others to do so as well.  Mainly because it is too heavy on suburban rail, which I believe does not provide enough value for its cost, and provides too little urban rapid transit which is what Seattle really needs.  Furthermore, combining urban and suburban rail systems results is a compromise that in the end won't serve either need very well.  Most mass transit systems around the world have a clear separation between the two.

For the enormous cost - $50+ billion total, $20,000+ per household, without guarantees that won't increase further - most communities will receive little to nothing with ST3.  Even communities that are served with light rail will have limited ridership, since the suburbs require extensive park and ride facilities for mass transit to be effective, which ST hasn't committed to.  Those thinking that large numbers of suburbanites will use local buses to transfer to light rail seem to be in some sort of a transit fantasy land.  Building suburban rail from scratch - especially with our geography - is extremely difficult and costly, and our suburbs just don't have the density to make it work.  I think the suburbs can be more effectively served by investing in BRT, especially if we could commit to even a fraction of what ST3 will cost.  Buses simply have the flexibility that rail doesn't have, and that flexibility will be important as technology evolves over the next few decades.  I'd honestly worry that ST's light rail system could be obsolete by the time it makes it to Everett, with commuters preferring driverless cars, vans, busses, etc. that are more able to meet their needs.

Anyway, i could go on, but I'm already rambling.  To be clear, I'd fully support a separate Seattle-only rail plan, since Seattle has the density and demand to support a grade-separated mass transit system.  Not to mention that the city has given up on surface options, so it would be nice to have alternatives to getting around.

"Traffic is bad for buses. There's a lot of really bad traffic in Seattle. Seattle, historically, has lacked the political will to demand high quality assets for bus routes like dedicated bus lanes, signal priority, etc, so our buses remain stuck with the rest of traffic, causing delays throughout the whole system. Many of the buses on a single route run on that route all day, laying over at each end of the route, but when one is so late, it obviously impacts the next run and continues cascading like that.

Fortunately, the 44 alignment (and many others) is slated for some of these improvements soon, but it still won't be done for a number of years. Get in touch with King County (email, tweet, phone, however) and let them know that you're in support of a more reliable bus service there.

"Here is a true story about  a thriving fortress I once had. 

My fortress was grand. 150 dwarves toiled daily in their industry. It had survived for years, subsisting mainly on mushrooms, hen eggs, and slaughtered yak. My strong army had repelled beasts and sieges, and I was feeling good. 

Then one day a forgotten beast appeared in the caverns below. A beakless Sparrow, ""beware its poisonous breath."" I thought it would be no problem for my seasoned army and I sent them to take care of it. Little did I know that when I first dug into the caverns, I had left a small hole in the ceiling uncovered that led directly into my base. As my army rushed to the cavern entrance, the sparrow flew directly into my base and into my workshops. By the time my army got back up, a dozen dwarves lay dead.

Still my army was able to fell the sparrow with only 2 casualties of its own. Well done. The fortress was safe. Then, when I went back to my great hall it was covered in Miasma (an effect that happens when there is rotting or death). I did not understand. Then I checked one of my war dogs. It's limbs were rotting off!

The poisonous breath that the sparrow unleashed caused a rotting effect on anything that touched it.

"Sucks to be you. Maybe if you encouraged people who *could* do it to actually do it, traffic would be better. 

If they opened up the expresslanes to everyone it would *make traffic worse*. A lot of people who are carpooling now would stop carpooling, and traffic in the express lanes and regular lanes would be as congested and slow as the regular lanes are now. 

&gt;I understand the point of carpooling but just open your eyes and see in reality it does not drive behavior to the level you think it does.

Weird because I never expressed to what level I think it drives behavior.

&gt;The WSDOT has stated that their goal is to move people efficiently, well when there are large swaths of unused capacity in express lanes it kind of defeats the point of moving people effectively especially when you look over to the main lines and see they are stopped.

"I really hope you're right about the WIAA state titles being vacated for all sports that involved athletes who were mentioned in the report. (here comes a rant...)

I graduated from Nathan Hale (Seattle public high school) a while ago. Hale does not have a lot of name recognition outside of it's student run radio station (C 89.5). When I was in high school I remember meeting kids from Shorecrest High School and telling them I went to Hale and they said they've never heard of it. Not only were Shorecrest and Hale both 3A schools at the time (Shorecrest is now 2A), they are only 2 1/2 miles apart! So yeah, no recognition at all. This is partially because we aren't great at sports. In over 50 years Hale has won 2 state championships (3 if you include the defunct sport of boy's gymnastics), and the last came in 1985. In 2014 Hale finished runner up to Bellevue in boys track and field at the state meet. Success in sports for Hale, let alone state championships, don't come around too often.

"TL;DR - call the Seattle Police non-emergency line, be prepared to wait 3-5mins on hold, then make a detailed report on the location, exactly how many tents you saw there that day, how many people, if you saw drugs or weapons, if anyone from the camp threatened you, are they camped on the sidewalk.  These are some things I have learned from calling in to SPD a few times. 

My theory is this - the squeaky wheel gets the grease right? In order to act, the SPD needs hard data like these reports.  Don't just call in once and then be frustrated, make a point to call every day and get it on the record.... the more reports, the faster the specific location will bubble up to the top of their list.  

I have used this policy and have already called in and made reports 3 days in a row this week.  Every day I walk by and count the tents, take some photos, count how many people around, and if there is any sign of drugs or weapons (ie. directly actionable items for SPD).  I also have started a call log where I record the date and time I called SPD, how many campers were there that day, and any notes from the conversation in case I need to reference it later. 

Don't give up, keep calling on multiple occasions and get those reports into the public record and encourage any like-minded neighbors to do the same.  Good luck and never give up.",,,,shambolictwid,,,1466034266,t5_2qhad,t3_4o8y24,t1_d4arso3,29,1469069069,0,0,d4awr8j,Seattle,29,,

"After the drunk lady came to my door, I told her that he wasn't my cat, but that I did suspect he had a home base nearby. I did due diligence asking all the neighbors about my stripey little beast. Half said he was a demon, the other half said he was a doll, and admitted to feeding him often. ""He loves deli meats you know!"" ""That cat's a glutton for turkey.""

Finally, I found the man with the answers. A neighborhood handyman who sees all and knows all. ""That cat? Yeah, he has an owner--nice old lady on Albion. Cat's name is Abbott."" I thought he said Abbott.

After that, I was a little weary around Tyrion--I even tried calling him Abbott but he responded to Tyrion with more enthusiasm. I admit, I was a little nervous to be seen with him. Maybe he was hurting my rep. I try to be known as a nice person. Tyrion might cast a mean girl light on me, you know?

But love overcame all. And things went back to normal. Then one day, Tyrion showed up donning a collar AND a note. The note was taped around his collar. I really didn't know if it was my place to take it off and read it, but couldn't imagine it who it might be intended for. The note said, (as best I remember)

""This is Agate. He is a sweet kitty but he does get fed so please don't worry about feeding him."" It also had a phone number ""for any questions."" I tried to affix the note back to his collar. I also promised myself not to bring anymore treats. ""Agate,"" I said. ""That's a much better name than Abbott."" He looked up at me like I was a fool--of course he had a cool name. ""Agate?"" I said to him. Nothing. ""Tyrion?"" He bunted his head against my leg.

The first collar was flimsy. Within a week or so, it was all torn up, and then, gone. But a month later he had more permanent jewelry. It was a nice safety collar (the first was just a cheap flea collar--probably just a means to secure the note), with a little medallion reading something like: ""Pet, please don't feed.""

Not since Al Roker have I seen faster weight loss. Tyrion went from stocky to svelte in no time. It made sense. My investigation yielded that the whole neighborhood was seeing to his immense appetites. We were all tithing to him like a little mafia. But he only stayed thin for so many months. Slowly, even I started sneaking a couple treats now and again--once every couple weeks. I felt guilty, but I wasn't the only one giving into Tyrion's charm. He never got chubby again, however. Everyone realized they weren't being charitable to a homeless feline who was starving in the streets.

Anyhow, moving away was hardest because of Tyrion. I cried when I said goodbye and promised to visit. I've come by twice, and only saw him once. But he still came to my call. He didn't have the collar anymore. I'm guessing he suspected it was cramping his style and he ditched it somewhere.

Anyhow, seeing your post made my day. I admit, I've been gone less than a year but I worry. Will people love him AS much as I did? But of course they will. You loved him. Many love him. He is complicated and strange. But like I said, choosy. So take it as a sure sign that he loves you back. Especially if he was rolling on his back &lt;3

"I do interviews for my tech company. My team recently hired two white guys and a Pakistani-origin American. I've also been an intern manager and all of the interns I managed were white. Some quick points reg. tech workers:

1. I can see generally a shortage of experienced white tech people for hire
2. Very, very few experienced tech women. So much that I hear of companies doing diversity programs that involve training and hiring women.
3. Many SE Asian people might be actually born here and are citizens and so would count as 'American'.
4. A huge % of SE Asians are vendors. Tech companies / body shops in that part of the world 'motivate' people by promising 'onsite' client work - the pay is higher. Very good ones end up getting hired by clients of those companies. Most return back after a few years. So they are a floating population.

My 2 cents.

"Yes, it is highly problematic for any middle- and low-income residents and citizens who are being forced out of the city, further from their places of employment and further from access to transit or public goods/services.

With extreme housing shortages, this Econ 101 principle doesn't hold true. There aren't mutual substitutions for ""overcharged"" rents - it just forces people who need to live in a particular area to spend more of their income on rent, putting them in worse means. 

Here's a great [article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/03/30/its-getting-more-expensive-to-be-poor/) on the subject: 

&gt; ""...Incomes have stagnated... and the share of household income going to housing has crept uncomfortably high, leaving many poor renters paying as much as half or more of their income on housing.
Pew calculates that median household expenditures, including everything from health care to housing to food and entertainment, grew by 25 percent from 1996 to 2014. Given that incomes haven't kept pace, that means that most families have less and less money left over after all their spending.

"This premise is ridiculous:

* The definition of craft beer has to do with how it's made; it has nothing to do with the company that makes it. Walmart is the #1 seller of organic groceries in the country. Just because they sell it, doesn't make it non-organic.
* InBev buying craft breweries isn't ""cultural misappropriation"", it's concession. We won. Craft beer is everywhere now. Craft beer didn't get worse, corporate beer got better. 
* This article conflates distribution for control. Flatstick specifically chose to go without a distributor knowing the amount of extra work and cost it that goes into it. There is plenty of competition for choice of distributor (hence the salesmen - **gasp* - trying to sell their services).
* InBev doesn't want to ""kill craft beer"" any more than Walmart wants to ""kill organics"". Inbev wants to make money. If they own distributors that make money selling craft beers (including their own), what incentive is in it for them? Especially since there is more markup to be made on the craft beers?
* If the point the article is trying to make is that InBev is trying to suppress small, *independent* breweries, they are obviously failing. Here's the number of breweries driven out of business by InBev: 0.

TL;DR: Competition is still a thing. This is a hipster article complaining about bands who sign with record labels.

"I'm a former competitive athlete both at a high school level and on a separate, national level. This is not a tragedy, this is a joke. 

&gt; To tell someone to focus on something else just because a bunch of cheating adults is really not that fair.

Life isn't fair. Life is about adapting to different circumstances. Yes, it's shit that the kids will have to pay the price for the adults' mistakes, but this will give them an opportunity to see what they're good at outside of football. If you only excel at one thing in life, you will not make it very far. Colleges and employers do want well-rounded employees, and most of them don't give a shit if you were High School Star Athlete of The Year. They want to see that you can work across multiple kinds of teams, they want to see if you're willing to do different things to maximize your skills (as an athlete, as a musician, whatever). They want to see people who can both lead when appropriate and follow when necessary. Instead of looking at this like a devastating event, encourage them to use it as an opportunity to explore other opportunities. There's no shame in differentiating yourself and perhaps finding another, equally valuable and rewarding passion in rock climbing, soccer, track, swim, or any number of other sports. 

&gt; Players, coaches and others base a lot around the tradition of play-offs. Maybe some teams are just there to have fun or whatever but its a serious motivation to those who take it seriously and want to be the best.

Other sports teams have traditions as well. And there's also no shame in creating new traditions on other sports teams, and being the best at other sports. The skills you need for one sports can be very translatable to another sport. 

&gt; Really un-American to punish these kids and not let them excel to their fullest in their chosen sport.

Are you seriously suggesting that kids *at Bellevue High School* can't excel to their fullest in football if that's ""their chosen sport""? There is nothing stopping them from participating on or even creating a private team. Who is stopping from excelling there? Literally nobody. 

&gt; Just clean the boasters and whatever coaching staff is guilty, rebuild the program with new staff and support and let the kids have a real season.

You're suggesting a slap on the wrist, when the more appropriate action is a blow to where it really hurts. The kids are not being robbed of any opportunities. High school, and life, are going to be what they make of it. If they choose to forgo any sports because they can't play football, that is THEIR mistake, and they are robbing themselves of opportunities to develop relationships, interpersonal skills, and physical challenges elsewhere in life. Football is not the End All Be All. I love a good football game like anyone else, don't get me wrong. But suggesting that it is even remotely like a tragedy is ludicrous and assumes that these high schoolers could never possibly be defined by something other than their ability to play football. It's a shame you think so low of those kids, because I certainly don't. ",,,,ImA90sChick,,,1465354760,t5_2qhad,t3_4n0ww5,t1_d40cji0,16,1468886241,0,0,d40dk9i,Seattle,16,,

"I'm in North Seattle, so most of my predictions are going to be from there:

Accelerating gentrification and increased real estate prices around the light rail stations in the U District, Roosevelt, and Northgate.

Gentrification along Lake City Way as the Pierre family is underway with their plans to convert their car lots to residential/commercial multi-use development.

Gentrification and a reduction in crime, centered around the police station at 130th &amp; Aurora.   The mobile home park and junkyard on 125th are no longer there.  Multi-story mixed use developments going up where small commercial buildings now sit along Aurora.   

Increasing development along all of Aurora as Faye Garneau passes away and her properties become available.   Possibly even the beginnings of a Shoreline-style revival of the corridor.

Increasing number of transit-only lanes to improve bus efficiency and service.   Road rechannelizations emphasize transit lanes to improve mobility for the greatest number of commuters in our denser city.

City government with several elected officials who support a harder line against property crime issues that affect livability.

"What your describing is NOT bait-and-switch. You are are not being offered a higher priced product in lieu of an advertised lower priced product.

The instructions are very clear. Did you not understand the instructions for winning? In the fine print area it says ""Bring invitation to event location to compare your confirmation code to the prize board to determine your prize."" If you fail to read and comprehend the simple instructions how it their fault?

Did you read and understand your odds of winning? The odds of winning all of the prizes except the gift card is 1 in 100,000. This means that if they send out 100,000 flyers then only 1 will be a winner. The odds of winning the gift card is 99,997 to 100,000. Considering that there are three other prizes with a 1 to 100,000 chance to win or 3 in 100,000 if you group then together this means that the other 99,997 in 100,000 flyers will not win you any of the top three prizes. But notice that 99,997 is some as the odds to win the gift card. This obviously means that all of the flyers that won't win you the top three prizes will win you the gift card.

"Not really, and I didn't need you to ""spell it out for me"". 

In NYC landlords intentionally let their complexes run down during the late 60's and throughout the 70's so eventually they could be condemned, since only buildings built before the rent control law went into effect were governed by the law.

So when the buildings were condemned and torn down the new ones that were built that weren't governed by rent control and they could be rented out at the currently high market rates.

The problems here are well documented and pretending like there haven't been moments of huge uproar against how you choose to run this subreddit is just laughable. But if I have to sum it up, you have decided on what your vision is for the subreddit and you give no room for any other way even though it is the people that come here that define the community, not you. We aren't engaged with this place because we know it is subject to your whims and ego and does not represent what we actually want.

This community sucks, and unless you mature to the point where you can admit that your actions are part of that equation then we will get nowhere. But I've never seen that, every time I've seen a problem brought up you have some excuse about how you are just trying so hard and its all their fault.

Maybe you should stop and question why your subreddit is different from others that have less members but more participation. This place should be a reflection of the community, not your unilateral decision of what it should be. You should be a steward to the community, not an overlord. Maybe some things have changed since the worst point, but i doubt it given that first sentence you wrote, that sounds par for the course, and from what I see by periodically browsing here.

After a rough start in the 90's that's been widely forgiven, Sound Transit is delivering. ULink was under budget, ahead of schedule, and so far wildly successful. North Link looks to be on time and possibly under budget already. Lynnwood Link is entering final design to start construction in a couple years. East Link broke ground and is set to open in 2023 (if it weren't for Bellevue and Kemper Freeman dicking around, it would have been 2021). Sounder and ST Express service are humming along with growing ridership. What specific clusterfuck are you referring to? Of course the ST3 planning process is a culsterfuck. We voted down ST2 before approving a better version a year later and have voted down all sorts of plans over the years.

"Im a former varsity coach for multiple sports and was an athletic director at a few small schools and I do look at this like it is a tragedy.

Many athletes choose a sport they love and want to focus on that. To tell someone to focus on something else just because a bunch of cheating adults is really not that fair.

A competitive teams season is based around the play-offs. Players, coaches and others base a lot around the tradition of play-offs. Maybe some teams are just there to have fun or whatever but its a serious motivation to those who take it seriously and want to be the best.

Really un-American to punish these kids and not let them excel to their fullest in their chosen sport. Hopefully there is an appeal process, but it would take a campaign to overturn something like this as whatever governing body who decided this is obviously very short-sighted. To give a death penalty to a college program that deals with millions every year is a little different than a HS. Just clean the boasters and whatever coaching staff is guilty, rebuild the program with new staff and support and let the kids have a real season.",,,,SeattleUberDriver,Northgate,,1465353207,t5_2qhad,t3_4n0ww5,t1_d40b89t,-13,1468885760,0,0,d40cji0,Seattle,-13,,flair northgate

&gt;One possible home: St. Louis, which is launching a streetcar line in a resurgent neighborhood and specifically wants antique cars. “We would definitely be interested,” says Joe Edwards of the Loop Trolley Transportation Development District, which is superintending the initiative.

&gt;Modern streetcars won’t do for St. Louis because its level-boarding design, which facilitates access by wheelchair, would require big modifications to the streets and thus run up the bill. The antique cars will operate at the existing street level, with disabled passengers boarding via lifts retrofitted into the cars. Edwards pegs total capital costs for the project at roughly $19 million a mile—versus about $54 million for our First Hill line. The Missourians have paid approximately $300,000 for each of the two cars they already own, as opposed to $3 million to $4 million for a modern streetcar. A private nonprofit will run the St. Louis operation.",,,,ChefJoe98136,West Seattle,,1464889603,t5_2qhad,t3_4m7ydi,t3_4m7ydi,15,1468765225,0,0,d3tcxk6,Seattle,15,,flair

"Hey there. I relocated from the East Coast and I know several others who did too. The big thing to know is that Seattle is expensive as fuck. I left NYC and moved here, and the prices here are already creeping into NYC range for middle class housing.

If at all possible, try to complete any certifications online before you get here. A Seattle CC might have a small advantage over a WV CC, but probably not after taking into account the cost of living difference. 

I will also say, although Seattle is miles more liberal than most places on the EC when it comes to politics, there is still quite a bit of subtle (and sometimes overt) racism here. Part of that comes from that fact that it's one of the whitest cities in America, and a lot of historic black neighborhoods have been or are in the process of being totally redeveloped, and are losing a lot of original residents. I don't know if any of that is a factor in your decision but it is what it is. (Most people I've met are cool though).

On the plus side, a lot of tech schools and companies are actively trying to increase diversity here. It would be worth your while to look into coding bootcamps and technical training programs to see if there are any that would offer reduced or free tuition, and you could apply/get accepted before moving. 

I know for women there's the Ada Academy which is tuition free. It's difficult to get into due to the large volume of applicants. Several of the other bootcamps offer scholarships to women and minorities. And Microsoft has the LEAP internship, although I think you need to have a reasonable amount of coding experience before applying.

Hope that helps! Seattle is an awesome, friendly and beautiful city. ",,,,fieldstation090pines,,,1465679266,t5_2qhad,t3_4nn3us,t3_4nn3us,22,1468970927,0,0,d45a6cj,Seattle,22,,

"&gt; Housing space is a shared resource

Nope. 

Can I walk into your house and sleep on your couch without your permission? Nah, and therein lies the crutch. The tragedy of the commons applies to situations where that sort of behavior is applicable (i.e. fishing on the open sea or in public waters, chopping down lumber in a communally owned forest or allowing your cattle to graze on public or non-owned land).
&gt;Housing space is a shared resource on the market

Nope, housing space is a privately owned resource traded on the market (much like any other privately owned resource it can be traded in a number of different ways at a number of different price points according to the needs and/or wants of the owners and any potential buyers).

&gt;People renting out their AirBNB's creating temporary hotels depletes the housing space available.

What you're describing right there is the price mechanism at work. The price mechanism allocates resources efficiently (i.e. to the highest bidder). No one has a problem when the price mechanism causes steel to be allocated to the bridge building industry instead of the rail building industry despite it being a ""shared resource"" by your reckoning (and it is a ""shared resource"" by your reckoning because the actions of certain players in the market for steel influences its price such that other players are deprived of steel at their desired price point).

&gt;We either have to build upwards

Correct but you're going off on a tangent here. Also, you're pro-liberalizing market reforms in this area but stifling government control over privately held resources in another, closely related market- how hypocritical.

"I think we are headed toward being another SF.  Tech is going to keep growing as the larger firms set up bigger and bigger satellite offices here to poach talent from one another.  Everyone making that tech money is going to want to invest in real estate and it's only going to continue to get more expensive.  I don't think we'll have hit a bubble yet, but if the city continues to be dependent on tech alone, I think a bubble will be continue to be predicted.  

I think transit will continue to be an issue, but I think will be a different set of issues.  With self driving cars on the horizon I think there will be changes to how we commute/park/travel.  Infrastructure is going to need to change to support a bunch of autonomous Ubers buzzing around downtown and out to the suburbs. I could see it going both ways:  I hoping that the tech increases capacity on our current roads as cars can follow more closely, and accidents are reduced.  But it could be like any other technology, and be a toy for the wealthy that doesn't really change anything, and we will continue to jam more cars onto the same over capacity road network.

I think Seattle will continue to hold on to its charm.  Surrounded by water, with unique neighborhoods.  I don't think the higher prices will send everyone with median incomes out of the city.  I think it will be a trend like NY, where vibrant parts of the city will just increase in density.  Capitol hill will have tiny apartments that are split by four 20-somethings.  Madrona will continue to support the wealthy old money of Seattle.  Ballard will be a forest of townhouses.  The Eastside will get more expensive too.

Secondly, I can't believe I got the photo wrong. I think about Agate ALL THE TIME and just got so excited. Gosh--there were so many times I wanted to come knock on your door just to say hi and tell you how much I love the little guy. I also always wanted to apologize for feeding him so many treats the first year or so. I'm a sucker for a handsome face.

Over the years, I truly considered Agate/Tyrion family. Many of my friends knew him and he had a relationship (albeit through my window, since my own boys aren't allowed outside) with my cats too. Lots of staring--some jealousy from my own cats as I'd sit on the porch with Agate for long periods of time.

I cannot believe someone took him though. That's wretched. I admit, there were some periods of time where I couldn't seem to find him. I don't know if this was during the same time, but a couple times I went searching. I knew he was probably safe and just ranging, but I worried something awful. But then he'd return--always the victor.

Anyhow, I just want to thank you for sharing your story and for sharing your darling boy with me for a while. To be honest, the years he was part of my life I was not well and rarely left the house. He was sort of my connection with the world. And I felt braver and safer walking around if he was there.

Last little memory--as I did start to get better, I'd sometimes see Agate roaming as I'd drive home in my car. I could call to him from my window and he'd run along and meet me as I parked. He's so bright! Anyway, it always made me feel like I was home again when he'd come running.

I'm very sad I won't be able to see him, but I hope he is really healthy and happy in SeaTac. Thank you again &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3

"The problem is that the vast majority of your submissions here are just reposts of your articles from mynorthwest.com, without further comment but often with headlines that are changed to be  significantly more Buzzfeed-esque than the real thing.  To many of us, it reads like you're just trying to drive readership to your own articles rather than actually participating in the community.

If you'd like to participate professionally, I always enjoy that sort of interaction - but I'd encourage you to read the recent AMA that the Times' Daniel Beekman posted as a wonderful example of what I like to see as a community member instead:  he clearly disclosed his position and occupation, wasn't only promoting a specific article, and had some unique expertise focused in a specific area to share with Reddit... and the discussion quickly grew beyond his stories as the community found the topics organically interesting and participated.

Against that backdrop, when you make an occasional personal submission (like the one about Solstice today), it creates the appearance that you're just padding your post count so you can superficially claim you are ""participating in the community"" when questioned about the articles.  This is doubly true when it's a low effort submission (the Solstice one just asks a bunch of open ended questions without sharing why you're interested or your own opinions).  I think that explains why the reaction there has been resoundingly negative and why your participation is gaining a poor reputation here.

I'd recommend:

- splitting your personal and professional identities on Reddit;  use the professional one for anything related to content you create or stories you are covering, and don't participate in those discussions with your personal account.  That will allow you anonymity and freedom to participate in general purpose discussions about everyday things unrelated to your job as a professional journalist.

- use the actual headline of articles when sharing them, and avoid ""clickbait"" - include as many summary details and relevant facts as you can about the article's conclusions in the headline, just as you would in a printed publication.  Trust that the community is mature enough to click anyway if the article topic stands on its own merits.

- strive to add value with each interaction, rather than treating Reddit as a source of clicks to your own platform.  Be upfront about what you're doing - if you want to find someone to interview, that's awesome!  Or if you are reading a discussion and an issue is covered by an article your publication wrote, it's totally cool to share it there (alongside a disclosure every time that you or a colleague is the author).  But simply dropping off links with altered headlines and no commentary makes it look like you just want free advertising.  If you post an article, include some context - ""this was inspired by the discussion I read here last week in xyz thread, and I wanted to share the follow up details I got from Elected Official.  Long story short, they agree with many of the sentiments expressed here, particularly around algebraic equality - details are in the article if you're curious."" is IMHO welcomed and appreciated.

"If a bomb was set off on a domestic flight it would just confirm what experts like Bruce Schneier and the government's own reviews have told us - the TSA misses almost all of the devices and weapons that have been sent through the security lines as tests.

A bomb in a security waiting line would cause airports, airlines, insurance companies, and business travelers to lose their minds.   TSA would probably respond by saying no carry ons at all, or they would put the carry on luggage through a separate check point.     And it would have a huge effect on the economy because a multiple-airport attack at the same time would make every airport a target no matter how big or small.

Dawkins gets to the point on this pretty quickly in *The God Delusion*: religion never deserves respect for its own sake. There's nothing inherently admirable about steadfast refusal to change your beliefs. Quite the contrary, it's the courage to admit one's views are wrong that deserves our attention. Notably, that's not conceding that others may also be right, it's specifically the continuous attempt to falsify one's own views.

There lies the difference between science and religion, and ignoring it keeps segments of our society anchored in the stone age. I'm entirely in favor of freedom of religion and freedom of speech, but the second you involve another human being, you're no longer talking about freedom in any capacity.

And then, we ended up waiting for almost 2 hours. About 45 minutes in to that wait, I asked the hostess how long it would be. She claimed she'd looked for us but didn't see us so she seated another party -- except we were standing like 10 feet away, within earshot of her, the whole time. Another 20-30 minutes later, we're still waiting so I go up to ask her how long it'll be again. She brushes me off with a ""it'll be soon"" and a few minutes later, I see *and hear* her complaining to some servers/bussers about how I keep bothering her. 

We were about to get out of there when a manager, who'd been running around all this time, seemed to have noticed us, apologized and got us seated. Best part, and final insult to injury, was that he offered us free mimosas as an apology for the wait, and when we got the check, we found out we'd been charged for those mimosas.

For the past 15 years Bellevue has raided outside programs for their best position player talent, and while that may have provided a great competitive opportunity for those players; they were denying them an honest education by filtering them through a glorified diploma mill.  

Many of those same players were lucky enough to get to play college football, but only a small fraction of those student-athletes played 4 years or even graduated college.  Why? Because they were denied their right to an honest high school education so they could focus on athletics. 

I see this as rich boosters praying upon underprivileged kids/their families for their athletic talent under the guise of creating college opportunity where they are set up to fail.

"Are you frikkin serious man? I am a gay ex-Muslim. There is so much explicitly in the Quran and more particularly the Hadith (specifically Sahih Bukhari and Sahih Islam) that is vile, disgusting, and graphically direct regarding the treatment of gay people. The tragedy was multifactorial, but Islam has played a huge role in shaping the attitudes towards gay people among Muslims, and I'm just talking about American Muslims - the most liberal of all - who do not live in a country defined by Islamic codes that sanction the death penalty against homosexuals (all but 1 country in the world that does this is a Muslim majority country). Look at Pew polls relating to attitudes of acceptance of homosexuality comparing Muslims to the background population - they are always and consistently much, much higher. I have heard my fair share of homophobic hate sermons in mosques growing up in several states across the US. Form this tragedy, I am going to make sure that we hold each other accountable so Muslim and ex-Muslim kids do not have to hear the same bull shit. You (Muslims in American in general) like to occasionally speak out about Salafist doctrine, but don't do anything about it of consequence. Will you please kindly go to the Hadith and strike out those homophobic verses and publicize it please? The literalist doctrine is what predominates among all Muslims, to varying extents, including those in America. I know this intimately. I don't know of a single Muslim, no matter how educated, professional and liberal, whom is willing to just plain stand up and admit that Surah 4:34 is gross and wrong no matter how you spin it. Or that the punishments for adultery and homosexuality are barbaric and unjust no matter how you ""interpret"" it. Shame on you for trying to change the topic when the lives of people like me are lost every day through hate crimes, vigilante ""justice"", and suicide in the Muslim world. 

If we don't own up to the problem, and have open and honest conversations criticizing the Islamic doctrine, you will never see the versions of Islam you proclaim to exist because they will never be seen as valid by large numbers of Muslims and many Muslims will never feel like they can criticize the scripture and follow those elements that they wish and openly and explicitly reject those that they disagree with, like cafeteria Catholics. 

Please read Maajid Nawaz's piece in the daily beast about this. If you are a Muslim and you want to make things better for all the minorities within Islam and that live with Muslims, particularly sexual minorities, do not try to obfuscate and redirect the much deserved blame that we need to bring attention to. We need to improve things, take self ownership and responsibility, and not obfuscate.",,,,HuggingPugs,,,1466143542,t5_2qhad,t3_4oenob,t1_d4byp7e,24,1469100315,0,0,d4cpzsy,Seattle,24,,

"This may sound un-PC, but Islam, interpreted this way, which I believe is mainstream, is not a religion of peace. 
It is a religion of personal violence. Sanctioned violence against women.

Listen to the way this Imam talks about women.  ""If you want to take your woman to the doctor....""  OMG.  As if she is a pet! 

Expanding a bit, just a tiny bit.... If you listen to the justifications for all the horrible views he is espousing, they are all founded on a book written by a warmonger and mass-murderer. This is religion, in a nutshell: suspend rational thought, suspend your personal decision-making process, submit to goofy ideas written by megalomaniacs a long time ago. 

That is just cray cray.  No matter what religion you're talking about. 

We had a religion sprout up in the USA - In 1830, a man named Joe Smith announced he had received revelations and created the Book of Mormon. It all sounds pretty crazy. But this is EXACTLY how every other religion was born. A Megalomaniac decides he wants to break all the rules (rules against polygamy, rules against mass murder, etc), and wants to make up new rules for everyone else, so he invents a giant justification based on his own personal ""direct connection to G*d"".  

We now have a word for that: cult.

"Honestly brother, I would look into a form of martial arts like BJJ.

Many self-defense classes teach variations of combatives that cannot be mastered in the 16-20 hours of instruction you're given. They look cool on a demonstrator who isn't trying to kill you.

If you feel like you need the ability to protect yourself NOW, apply for a concealed pistol license, get yourself a quality firearm and quality holster. There's plenty of good media that can teach you the basics of the law of self-defense such as Massad Ayoob's old, but still informative VHS tapes that can be found on youtube. 

You may be anti-gun, you may be pro-gun or indifferent. You may hate the idea of concealing a gun. Oh well, if you're not yet a trained martial artist there's the only real shortcut. In a fight for your life you will probably find yourself ill-equipped until you have trained to proficiency in a martial art, and even then you would still rather have a firearm.

Self-defense is a system and a mindset. Carrying a gun will not make you any safer if you can't avoid risky situations. Good verbal communication skills, good awareness, the ability to handle yourself in a hand-to-hand altercation are also equally important.

Probably not the answer you wanted, but you're not going to learn anything in a weekend class.

Compare the PI with that the komonews coverage of this year's parade: 39 photos . . . of the 39 photos, there are 8 views of unclothed back . . . 2 or 3 of blocked nudity of breast or frontal (implied nudes) . . . one side view of a breast from the back . . . 2 photos in which, because of the body paint, you may not be sure if you are seeing all the guy from the side and slightly to the front.

The PI has more than 100 photos up.  The fifth photo, among others, is taken from the front of more than a dozen of the naked bicyclists, both men and women.  In the photo series at the PI, there are many which are showing topless nudes, from the side or front, enough to see ""both.""",,,,zaitzeff,,,1466350086,t5_2qhad,t3_4otero,t3_4otero,-15,1469147077,1,0,d4ffnt3,Seattle,-15,,

"I'm not sure what OP is talking about, because the Bible says nothing about that.  It does, however, give guidelines on beating slaves.

Exodus 21:20-21 (NASB): ""If a man strikes his male or female slave with a rod and he dies at his hand, he shall be punished. If, however, he survives a day or two, no vengeance shall be taken; for he is his property.""

Although, a chapter before it does put wives in with other property:

Exodus 20:17 (NASB) ""You shall not covet your neighbor’s house; you shall not covet your neighbor’s wife or his male servant or his female servant or his ox or his donkey or anything that belongs to your neighbor.”

Or I guess if you marry a slave then you could beat them? 

Numbers 31:17-18 (NASB) ""Now therefore, kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman who has known man intimately. But all the girls who have not known man intimately, spare for yourselves. ""

The really sad thing is, the Bible likely does not address wife beating because no clarification was probably needed.  In most of the cultures where the Bible was written and followed, women were legally defined as property, and men had a lot of leeway in how they handled their property.  The right to beat your wife, donkey, slaves or children was a given.  ",,,,CalvinLawson,,,1466124031,t5_2qhad,t3_4oenob,t1_d4cczfz,13,1469094635,0,0,d4ce3au,Seattle,13,,

More seriously, the largest part of the cost in the city is due to land acquisition. Usually, building sidewalks in areas that don't have them means you need to buy, at market rate, parcels of land from the homeowners you're building sidewalks for. Not only is the land purchase cost expensive, but you will inevitably have to use eminent domain for some of those who refuse, which adds legal costs on top of the reasonable compensation for the land.

The other biggest cost is that sidewalks often displace the water table, and to prevent flooding nearby homes, you need to install sewers/drainage.

"In general COLAs are based off the Consumer Price Index which is maintained by the Bureau of Labor Statitics. They take a handful of consumer items (like corn or toothpaste) and measure their cost a handful of times in a handful of places to find an average overall increase for the year. Everything is grouped together and an average is born - so even if corn went from being $2.00 a pound to $20.00 a pound but everything else experienced only a minor increase, on average the increase would still be low.

For the last couple of years the increase has been hovering around 1.2-1.5% but some websites say average rent in Seattle has increased between 9-13% over where it was just six months ago. I don't know if you have any power in contract negotiations, but at my job we fought for and won a base COLA regardless of CPI - something like 3% increase in 2016, 3% increase in 2017, and 4% increase in 2018.

"Why would ""fellow Seattleites and Washingtonians"" vote against their own financial self-interest by offering to pay to keep the elderly, mentally ill, sick, and simply unlucky off the streets?

Ultimately, the financial self-interest argument doesn't lead to the elderly, mentally ill, sick, and simply unlucky being taken care of by those who are better off, whether you're talking about voters as a whole or just landlords. 

The only way to ""justify"" taking resources from others (whether through just taking money away through taxes or through effectively taking money away through restrictions that force landlords to phase in rent increases) to ensure that people being cared for is a moral or ethical argument.

Your narrative and YouTube videos break both of those rules. The home page even shows an animation of a boat finding itself in the path of whales and moving out of the way.

"If you load up Redfin and take a look at [San Francisco](https://www.redfin.com/city/17151/CA/San-Francisco) from a high level, you'll see the average price is just about $1.2mm. If you load up redfin and look at [Seattle](https://www.redfin.com/city/16163/WA/Seattle) from a high level, you'll see the average is $500k. SF average price for square footage is nearly $900, in Seattle its just under $400.

Now, I'm just a ~~caveman~~ artist so I don't really understand things like math and statistics, I find them scary and frustrating, but to me it seems we have a ways until we're ""catching up"".

Additionally the average time a place stays up for sale is a bit shorter in Seattle: 7 days vs 13 (according to redfin). Plus we tend to have one more bedroom and a bit more square footage. 

Seattle has a lot in common with the geography of SF. Surrounded by water and peppered with steep hills.

"Hi!! I'm the infamous Agates mom :) so funny he made it onto Reddit- usually it's just Instagram and tumblr. (Check out #catbauer another handle of his) we lived on Albion for the last 10 years. Apparently I'm the nice old lady- haha. I remember the exact collar incident you were referring- that was about 4 years ago if I remember correctly. Agate has an incredibly colored past- the whole reason why he wasn't wearing a collar was because another woman kept taking them off! This same woman actually STOLE agate, renamed him monkey and moved him to Ballard. Once her roommate gave her up and called me (his agate collar with my phone number was still on him at that point) I went and rescued him from Ballard, only for this chick Annie to come steal him again 2 days later! After getting the police involved she stopped taking him, but continued to remove his collars when she came to bastyr to work. At $15 a pop (not including the personalized name tag) that became too expensive to keep up with. After her mother called me from Ohio and offered to BUY agate- we sent him to live with my brother in Olympia for 3 months till things cooled off. 
The simple flea collar was actually put on agate with a note by Becky who works at a business on woodland park- agate had been showing up there day after day and they got curious. The note you read was my response to her.... Agate continued to work there for the next 4 years. They actually threw him a retirement party at the end of May- you can follow the action at #catbauer. 
The agate stories continue- I got a phone call once that he was in lake Stevens.....
That being said- the photo that began this thread actually isn't of agate- it is another tabby with very close markings.

"A couple of years ago I was ready to buy a new car.  I'd decided on a Honda CR-V.  I found two identical new CR-V's online--same model, same color, same advertised price--one at Honda of Bellevue and one at Honda of Seattle.  I messaged both dealers from their websites, told them I was looking at these two cars, and what kind of deal could they make me?  Honda of Seattle called me right back and gave me a good price over the phone.  Honda of Bellevue wouldn't--they said I should come in and talk.  Okay, it's close to where I work, so I'll play...  

So that evening after work, I went in.  I told the salesman (a pleasant enough kid--I don't think these tactics were his idea) I was pre-approved for a loan and I was definitely buying a car this weekend, and that it was between theirs and Honda of Seattle's.  I asked again if he could give me a better price than the one in the ad.  The salesman evaded the question, wanted me to name a payment I could live with.  We went round and round for a while, with me saying, no, I have one price already and I really want to compare apples to apples--so what's the price you'll sell me this car for?  He kept asking me to name a payment, so finally, I gave him one, to see what would happen then.  He went off to see what his manager would do--but first he said his manager would be more willing to deal if I committed to buy the car tonight.  I repeated, no, I'm not ready to do that--I will buy this weekend, but *not* right this minute.

The salesman came back with this from his manager ""We're not going to commit to talking numbers with you until you are willing to commit to us.  If we give you a number you'll just use it against us.""  Seriously??  They really expected me to agree to buy the car first, and *then* to just go along with whatever they told me I was paying?  Does anybody really do that??  And the manager didn't even have the courtesy to deliver that rude blow-off in person--he made the kid do it.

I walked out.  I went over to Honda of Seattle.  I had a perfectly pleasant interaction with their salesman, and his manager, and their finance guy, who all took the time to talk with me face-to-face and answer all my questions without a fight.  They made me a decent deal, and I bought the car from them that night--two hours after Honda of Bellevue's manager blew me off because I wouldn't instantly roll over and open my checkbook in response to his arrogant pressure tactics.

I would do business with Honda of Seattle again, gladly--but I wouldn't deal with Honda of Bellevue again if they were the last dealer in the state.

"It's more of a when, really, and not when it expands but when it crashes again.

I probably sound and look like a mad, grizzled old prophet waving my arms around like a crazy person and talking nonsense...

...but most of the younger tech-employed generation weren't really around during the crash in the early 2000s, and I don't think they really understand how fast and hard the tech industry crashed back then, doing the same things the tech industry is doing today.

I do acknowledge that millennials know what tough times are, that they also having a rougher go of it with more school debt, lower relative pay, more competition and a higher cost of living.

And that they're way, way more vulnerable to a tech bubble bursting than gen X was.

But it was a fucking financial nightmare. People went from millionaires to ""Hey, can I crash on your couch?"" and even ""Oh, shit, the SEC or feds are after me about my options, can I borrow some cash for a lawyer?"" so fast that people left contrails and even stains on the ground.

What was even worse was all the lower echelon or non-shareholding tech workers who were living very comfortably paycheck to paycheck and even overspending beyond their means who were shitcanned en-masse, and you were lucky if you got any severance or layoff assistance.

Multi-million dollar companies - some that actually made useful software or hardware, with actual customer bases - just straight fucking evaporated, sublimating from solid to gas.

And some evaporated not necessarily because anyone did anything wrong, but because the whole market crashed and suddenly B2B partners they relied on crashed, or someone they supplied to crashed, or they used a product in their product that died.

But mainly because no one was buying, much less willing to invest, so lines of credit dried or died, or business plans that required further rounds of planned funding to grow could no longer secure that funding.

And we are drastically overdue for another tech bubble to burst and crash, and I don't think many of today's younger tech generation actually understands what that means or why that it could be this way or time for another bubble to pop.

Right now there are way too many overvalued stock values at established companies, in addition to so many startups that are only being seeded/angel funded in the pre-IPO stages in the hopes that Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Apple or some other big company just buys them out in yet another overpriced tech/talent/userdata buyout so they can cash out early.

And it's not a question of if this bubble bursts, but when, and that when is probably coming sooner than anyone thinks.

The market is utterly saturated with startups that don't actually have any kind of a profitability plan or true, deliverable product short of ""accrue user data through service signups. Sell out to the first high bidder, hopefully pre-IPO.""

And this doesn't even begin to allow for what happens if this bubble bursts during a total economic clusterfuck like the 2008 banking/subprime scandal, or any other general economic recession or downturn.

One of the reasons why the 2008 subprime shit show was more survivable was because the tech bubble we're in now was, err, starting up, there was a growing, rebuilding economy.

It was in this era that a lot of tech things we take for granted now were born or started rapidly maturing. Reddit. YouTube. Facebook. Smartphones. Commercial online video, music and media sales and streaming.

And today? We're kind of stagnating again. Even (if not especially) iPhones and Apple products are succumbing to bloat. The newest, shiniest thing we've seen in the last few years is VR goggles and smartwatches, and even those aren't new by 20-30 years.

Sure, biotech is churning along rapidly, but there's a lot of bloat and dross and overvaluation, too. They're also not immune to overvaluation bubbles.

"One time years ago I had to travel for work and was going to be gone a month. 

A couple days into the trip, my girlfriend calls to tell me the city had just come by and put out ""no parking"" signs where my beloved old classic car was parked.

I frantically call around and discover Lincoln towing up on aurora is the tow company that's going to be impounding my car in the morning. 

I call them and explain the situation and the miserable living ashtray who answered starts laughing and taunting me with the fact that they were going to auction my car.

It was looking like my only option was to pay out of pocket for a round trip ticket home which I couldn't afford. 

Luckily though the umpteenth mobile locksmith I called agreed to come cut a new key for the car even though I wasn't there to prove I was the car's owner.

Landlord's right of entry—Purposes—Searches by fire officials—Searches by code enforcement officials for inspection purposes—Conditions.](http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=59.18.150)

&gt; (1) The tenant shall not unreasonably withhold consent to the landlord to enter into the dwelling unit in order to inspect the premises, make necessary or agreed repairs, alterations, or improvements, supply necessary or agreed services, or exhibit the dwelling unit to prospective or actual purchasers, mortgagees, tenants, workers, or contractors.

The law does set out some requirements for how much notice they have to give you and other details.  If they aren't following those rules, or they're entering your apartment in a way that constitutes harassment, you have some recourse.  But yes, they can come in and show the place, and being inconsistent about responding to requests to show it in the past doesn't change that.

[Tenants Union of Washington State:  Privacy Rights](http://www.tenantsunion.org/en/rights/section/privacy-rights)

I know it's intrusive and disruptive to have somebody come over and poke around your home.  But these people aren't your visitors, they're your landlord's.  You don't owe them much--just basic civility, really.  Having at least minimal clothes on when they come over is probably good, too.  But you're certainly not obligated to leave your apartment, or clean until the place is spick-and-span, or stop what you're doing to chat with them.  Your landlord probably won't give you a good reference if they come over and the place is a fetid mess, or if you're overtly uncooperative and hostile to them or the prospective tenants--but if you already have a new place, how much do you care?

And regarding your dog--your landlord would probably prefer to show the place without having it barking and gnawing on their ankles.  It would be very reasonable to ask them to pay for a day of doggie daycare when they want to show the place.  Otherwise, as long as the dog is permitted under the lease, you have a right to have it there, and they'll just need to deal with it.",,,,casagordita,SeaTac,,1465496012,t5_2qhad,t3_4nbxy4,t3_4nbxy4,14,1468924601,0,0,d42lg8h,Seattle,14,,flair

"If you take him at his word, his thinking on the subject ""evolved.""  Why not?  Mine has, on any number if issues.  Flip-flopping by politicians is highly under-rated.  Why do we have such a problem with people who start out with an ignorant opinion, then gain more information and experience with the issue, and eventually change their minds once they know better?  Do you WANT a leader who isn't capable of doing that?

If ""evolving"" was a more politically-acceptable way of saying that when he ran in 2008, supporting same-sex marriage wasn't a viable position to take and would have hurt his chances of getting elected...well, that's a judgment call that's endlessly debatable.  Every candidate has to make hundreds of decisions like that--where to stick their necks out and take a gutsy stand and hope to drag the electorate along with them, and where to lay low and get elected and make incremental changes and do the most possible good in the long run.  Sure, I'm not happy about where Obama started out on this issue, but I'm happy with where he's ended up.

Oh--and the Supreme Court doesn't get *all* the credit.  There have been dozens of actions taken by federal agencies, before and after the Supreme Court decision on marriage equality, that recognized same-sex marriages and gave them the same rights and benefits as any married couples.  Those agencies don't make policy independent of the White House--the direction *has* to come from the top.  In 2009, right after he took office, Obama directed federal agencies to extend whatever benefits they could under existing authority to the same-sex partners of federal employees.

"At the event on June 4th, let us also remember the Tiananmen Massacre anniversary.

June 4th was springtime in Beijing, and the 
Chinese students were gathering each day at 
Tiananmen Square to promote US-style democracy. 
Then the current Chinese government killed them. 

The starry-eyed Chinese youthful dreamers made 
a mock-up Statue of Liberty just like the gift 
from the people of France to the American people. 
Then the Chinese government shot them all dead. 

The Chinese student idealists wrote down their 
dreams for Chinese democracy and posted papers 
for all citizens to read at Tiananmen Square. 
The government crushed the students with tanks. 

We have a secret plan to overthrow the Chinese government: 

* 80302 44995 07472 44307 43361 90361 13905 
* 54307 65338 25143 47597 99251 92510 97003 
* 04375 65507 42649 50873 14970 55327 57100 
* 75216 01863 52733 14463 67039 96531 31397 

When Chinese students come to America to study 
at your local community college or university, 
welcome them into your home, love-bomb them as 
visitors yearning for democracy in China, and 
turn them into spies to overthrow the government. 

The University of Washington has lost its moral 
compass, and Microsoft never had one. They are 
collaborating with the unelected Chinese regime 
with a special campus in Bellevue where we must 
protest in the face of visiting Chinese officials. 

Let Microsoft and the UW answer the question: Will 
the students from China be allowed to erect monuments 
in memory of the hundreds of students killed by their 
own unelected Chinese government? Will there be freedom 
of speech for Chinese students studying at UW Bellevue?

It seems like the University of Washington really does 
not care about students. The official UW attitude seems 
to be: ""Okay, Chinese government, kill as many students 
as you like, slaughter them by the hundreds and forbid 
their families to find out what happened to them or to 
talk about the killings, the piles of bloody bodies, 
the news black-out ever since."" If you are a UW alumnus, 
complain to the individual members of the Board of Regents 
about collaborating with the bloody Chinese murderers and 
promise to stop all financial support for the UW if the 
UW continues to engage in a joint venture with the killers 
of hundreds of idealistic young Chinese students. We can't 
expect Microsoft to have a conscience, but we can demand it 
of the state-funded University of Washington -- where student 
lives no longer seem to matter, and only money reigns supreme. ",,,,ArthurTMurray,University District,,1465016929,t5_2qhad,t3_4mgpop,t3_4mgpop,-14,1468801198,0,0,d3vfwd5,Seattle,-14,,flair

They give an implication that it's the $5000 prize by having their prize listings next to that box with 4 selections in both categories but if anyone ever did take them to court over it, the dealership could point out that the stuff on the left is clearly inside its own box separate from the prize listings and any connection was something that the person suing inferred on their own.  

Also looking at the fine print, the odds of winning anything besides the gift card is 1 in 100K for each prize (meaning they likely made a single winning card for each of the higher tier prizes in order to validate their claim that you could win that).  It would be interesting to know if they did actually send out winning cards.  Not sending winning cards out would be illegal but hard to detect.  More likely they did send out winners but the actual winner would have no idea unless they brought it in to the dealership (essentially the winner has to fall for the scam in order to even realize that they did win big).

"In lieu of explaining like you're 5, I'll explain like you're ... 50, maybe.

So, Seattle is an old town, as things are reckoned on the West Coast of American anyhow, but it has had a rocky past. You see, like many metropolitan areas during the mid-20th century Seattle experienced a period of urban decay as people left the city to live in the suburbs. There were lots of reasons why this happened: the post-WWII ideals of the nuclear family in a single family home, racism, the rise of the automobile, nevertheless it happened. Seattle's population reached a peak in 1960, and it didn't get back there until about the year 2000, when changing ideals of work and home life, a changing economy, and cultural shifts (slightly less overt racism) caused ""young urban professionals"" (the classic ""yuppies"" originally) to flood back into urban centers.

During that period in the late/mid 20th century Seattle, like many American cities, languished in decline. With hollow budgets due to limited tax revenues there was a persistent lack of investment in key city infrastructure such as mass transit. Worse, when new life started being breathed into the city (the late '90s and early 2000s) was precisely the moment when ""tax revolts"" were cresting in popularity. For these reasons Seattle has lagged in building good mass transit systems for a city of its size and economic advancement. However, enough people have had the foresight and the wherewithal to work on building good transit infrastructure in the Seattle region and managed to get the votes behind it to start building out some of it. That's how Seattle ended up building light rail between downtown and the airport as well as out to Capitol Hill and the University District, with expansions up to Northgate Mall currently in progress.

However, this is still just a skeleton of the sort of rail based transit system a city the size of Seattle actually needs. And that's where ST3 comes in, it's an enormous and wide ranging long-term plan to connect the metropolitan area with a degree of rail infrastructure that actually sort of looks like a decent attempt at a proper subway system, with rail connections to Ballard, West Seattle, North Seattle and up through Everett, south to Tacoma, and even connectivity to and around the East Side. ST3 would dramatically transform the transit situation in Seattle linking core urban centers by rail. Which should result in a significant increase in commuting via transit, improve the utility of buses at a neighborhood level, and generally make it easier to get around the region without a car.

The ST3 proposal, which is coupled with bond measures to pay for it, will be on the ballot this November.",,,,rocketsocks,,,1466755339,t5_2qhad,t3_4pjp5k,t1_d4lwfex,25,1469260294,0,0,d4lzpxx,Seattle,25,,

"Just for context and some responses to popular comments on here:

1) This encampment isn't planned for anywhere near the ave, has its own security, and all individuals participating in unsafe acts (drugs, violence) are promptly removed. All residents are checked prior to entry, as well. This is a place for people to get help and be supported while they work and transition into jobs to improve their lives. Not some shelter for drug addicts to do drugs.

2) The site is proposed west campus, north of the stadium, and won't take very much space or up any parking. Also, the rumor is this will be during the winter quarter, so little conflict with any football stadium. They need the place to be close to transit, so that's why it would be there. 

3) Students asked for this. They petitioned in student governments, and proposed this idea for the administration. The student population was surveyed and overwhelmingly wants to support this population.

4) The time and resources here aren't much from UW. Yes, some permitting costs and some support, but most of it is funded through a partnership with a sponsoring organization.

"It is a bugzooka. I bought it on Amazon. It is the best thing. A one way,  manual powered bug grabber. A friend and I enjoy trying to grab flies out of the air. I am thinking about buying a second one just so I can have competitions.   
  
Originally I purchased it so my wife could get bugs. Nope, still to scary.



Edit: the machine has a spring you compact and then a trigger to release pushing out a diaphragm(?) to cause a sudden burst of suction. There is a metal filter at the bottom of this removable tube with a one way spring trap door at the top. You are supposed to clean it out, but it grosses me out so I just leave it. The bugzooka came with two catcher tubes (one clear and one smoke). I put the smoke one in a zip lock bag in the freezer to kill the bugs humanely, but then I dropped it and it broke. The clear is my last catcher, so if I put it in the freezer and see a big spider, I will be SOL, and I'll just have to live my life knowing there is a giant spider roaming about. There probably are dozens, but seeing one and not getting it is the worst.   
  
Also, I have had a few huge flies I caught and watching the spider eat them is kinda fun. Im getting kind of attached and don't want to kill it. I have had Charlotte for about 3 weeks now.

"Whether you're going ""too fast for conditions"" may also depend on whether you're ""following too close.""

Legally, if the driver in front of you slams on the brakes, it's entirely your obligation to be able to stop without a collision.  If you leave an adequate following distance, you have plenty of time to avoid a crash when you come to a slowdown.  If you insist on tailgating, you need to drive slowly enough that you can safely stop in whatever little space you've left.


RCW 46.61.400
Basic rule and maximum limits.

(1) No person shall drive a vehicle on a highway at a speed greater than is reasonable and prudent under the conditions and having regard to the actual and potential hazards then existing. *In every event speed shall be so controlled as may be necessary to avoid colliding with any person, vehicle or other conveyance on or entering the highway in compliance with legal requirements and the duty of all persons to use due care.*

(2) Except when a special hazard exists that requires lower speed for compliance with subsection (1) of this section, the limits specified in this section or established as hereinafter authorized shall be maximum lawful speeds, and no person shall drive a vehicle on a highway at a speed in excess of such maximum limits.

(a) Twenty-five miles per hour on city and town streets;

(b) Fifty miles per hour on county roads;

(c) Sixty miles per hour on state highways.

The maximum speed limits set forth in this section may be altered as authorized in RCW 46.61.405, 46.61.410, and 46.61.415.

(3) The driver of every vehicle shall, consistent with the requirements of subsection (1) of this section, drive at an appropriate reduced speed when approaching and crossing an intersection or railway grade crossing, when approaching and going around a curve, when approaching a hill crest, when traveling upon any narrow or winding roadway, and when special hazard exists with respect to pedestrians or other traffic or by reason of weather or highway conditions.",,,,jmputnam,,,1466029127,t5_2qhad,t3_4o8nix,t1_d4ap3fb,11,1469067376,0,0,d4atb6a,Seattle,11,,

Edit to add:

See two rules adopted by the Washington State Pharmacy Board in 2007. The first rule, known as the Delivery Rule, requires pharmacies to “deliver lawfully prescribed drugs or devices to patients and to distribute drugs and devices approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration for restricted distribution by pharmacies.” Wash. Admin. Code §246–869–010(1).

The Delivery Rule works in tandem with a pre-existing rule, called the Stocking Rule, that requires pharmacies to stock a “representative assortment of drugs in order to meet the pharmaceutical needs of its patients.” §246–869–150(1). 

Per Justice Alito's dissent, ""The net result of these rules is that, so long as there is customer demand for emergency contraceptives, pharmacies... must stock and dispense them regardless of any religious or moral objections that their owners may have.""",,,,joemondo,Fremont,,1467176909,t5_2qhad,t3_4qae7z,t1_d4s71em,13,1469367711,0,0,d4s7eub,Seattle,13,,flair

* Whidby Is. Naval Air Station has squadrons of land based maritime patrol aircraft and carrier based electronic warfare planes
* Indian Is. across from Port Townsend is a major munitions depot
* Naval Station Everett is home to the USS Nimitz (the aircraft carrier is currently getting maintenance in Bremerton) and several other ships
* Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton still has important ship repair facilities and is were we decommission nuclear subs.
* JBLM has combined Fort Lewis and McCord Air Force Base which still host plenty of soldiers and airmen.  

Many of the military installations in Seattle have closed in recent years. Some were [turned into parks](http://www.seattle.gov/parks/history/military.htm) while other federal government agencies have occupied others.

* Discovery Park: Ft. Lawton shrank considerably in the early 1970's but reserve components were there till 2011

"Why is it intolerable that a hugely expensive road development be paid for by the people using it, rather than by people who never touch it?  You don't even have to stop for this toll system.  Honestly it seems like most people that get mad about this just don't want to see the costs of the infrastructure they use be clearly visible in their daily expenses.  The funds can't be used for anything else, so you can't wave it off as stupid funding relocations.  The toll also serves to show you how volatile and delicate long-distance transit systems are.

If you don't want to get stuck in traffic or pay a bounty to use bridges, plan your housing accordingly.  I swear next people are going to complain that the commuter ferry from Friday Harbor is too slow and expensive for commuting.

"has anyone in the media covered the crime that is involved with the homeless encampments? specifically bicycle theft?

i've cleared out a few camps around town and found countless stolen bikes, some from people that i knew whos it was. i see mountains of bicycles in homeless camps regularly. even in times photos. can you all start talking about that type of rampant crime? it's really hard to miss, but it's happening all over. the police are doing next to nothing about it.

people say not to criminalize homelessness but lets not overlook blatant crimes that do happen with homelessness. especially crimes that have results that are plain to see.

"We had a similar question recently:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/4dc6mm/most_pet_friendly_places_to_rent/

Upshot: sorry, we don't know either. The rental market is very ""hot"" here; landlords can be picky and so most of them aren't going to be flexible. 

My best advice would be to leave your pets in NY if you can, either with friends/family or by leaving behind your spouse. Find a permanent place here, then move the pets. 

The alternate is to look for house rentals well outside the Seattle city limits in the hope to find an area with lower demand where the landlord may work with you. (You're going to pay for that with a nasty commute...) With for-sale houses you can search by how long a place has been listed; can you do that with rentals, e.g. on Zillow, to find something that's been sitting for a while?

"The speed limit of the bridge is 50 for a reason. Mostly due to the wear and tear. Decreasing the speed limit increases the lifespan and reduces overall maintenance needed. But also safety since one side of the bridge is incomplete.

If everyone always kept their cars in great shape, the wear on the roads would be reduced quite a bit. As a road engineer once explained to me, the vibration people feel in their car is one of the significant factors of road wear. If you have ever driven a car that vibrates more vigorously when going faster, that kind of force is also being applied to the road the car is driving on. Commercial vehicles are worse for road wear and why they have special limits set on them like sections of I5 and I90 and they pay additional fees to account for their increased wear. The indents on the road vehicles drive on aren't caused simply by the weight of the cars on them, it's caused by the constant change in dynamic weight while moving. This becomes worse and worse as the road wears out increasing the change in dynamic weight.

A clear example of this happening is expansion joints on I-5. Every time you drive past one, your car dips a little. After enough impacts, the dip becomes bigger which makes future impacts even stronger. They eventually fill them a little to reset the cycle. This happens everywhere on the roads people drive on but at a lessor degree. Drive from Seattle to Tacoma and its a bumpy ride most of the way and it's not because of your car.",,,,VietOne,,,1464979960,t5_2qhad,t3_4mdyu6,t1_d3urjvc,32,1468790452,0,0,d3utjji,Seattle,32,,

"I sold my BMW on craigslist here a while back, and I think you could too.

If the car is dirty, get together a few bucks, take it to a car wash, clean it up and vacuum inside. It's a good investment. Take all the mess in the floorboards and move it to the trunk, at least for the photos.

It sounds like you have a phone. Take some photos. If you can get your hands on a nicer camera, that's **way** better. Make sure to get all angles, inside and out. I ended up with about 60 photos for mine. If there is damage, be upfront about it. Used car buyers are (rightfully) skeptical and this will help win trust.

Get on Kelley Blue Book and find the private party value for your vehicle. That may or may not be what you'll get on a private sale. Scout craigslist and see what similar cars are listed at. It's hard to tell what they're selling at since there's no history and negotiations happen.

Post it on craigslist and maybe some enthusiast forums like bimmerforums. Include all the info you can. Service records, if it's been tracked (more importantly, if it **hasn't** been tracked), issues, and why you're getting rid of it. You don't have to say, ""because I'm experiencing homelessness,"" you could say instead, ""because I hardly drive it anymore.""

It sounds like you're concerned about having buyers come to the camp where you're living. That's the great thing about craigslist: **People think it's completely normal to not meet you at your house.** When I sold mine, we met in a Safeway parking lot, went for a test ride, then he handed over cash and I handed over the keys, filled out a bill of sale, and we were done. The buyer had no idea where I lived.

In case you're worried about taxes, remember that it's the the **buyer's** responsibility to pay taxes on the sale, not yours. They may ask you to put ""GIFT"" on the bill of sale to avoid taxes. IANAL, but I would advise against that.

They're used nationally by fire, and some EMS agencies. The keys are usually kept on the duty ring that goes for the vehicle, or stays with the station officer on duty and is passed down from shift to shift.

Someone must have lost a set of duty keys along the way or there's a rat working in one of the local departments.

"I know a lot about the cat in question. I think I could do a whole AMA for him. Where to start? First, I love him too. I lived in his neighborhood (and it is HIS) for a few years. Every night he would come to my door and I would come with pets and often little treats. I have two indoor kitties of my own, but I came to love him. Not knowing his name, I called him Tyrion. And for years I could call for Tyrion almost anywhere within five blocks or so and that guy would come running. I felt like a summoner. We worked on my patio together (me pulling weeds, Tyrion rolling in the sun), held palaver on my porch long into nights when I was stressed, and took walks--he'd follow me anywhere between The Troll and Stone Way. It's his beat.

But there was more to the mystery.

One night, around midnight, there was a banging on my door. It was a woman from down the street (noticeably drunk from her breath and demeanor). She was very upset that MY cat had scratched her girlfriend. I felt really bad, but told her my cats were indoor cats. Then she described Tyrion, and said she always saw me with him.

Now, I had long suspected Tyrion to have the cruel heart of a Lannister. He was an alley cat--it seemed--and he was often roughed up. I'd hear cat fights in the alley on warm nights and it scared me. I was worried for my little Tyrion for many months in the beginning. But I had also noticed a toughness in the guy. Could he be the menace and not the menaced? He was sweet to me, but not always a gentleman to my husband and to others who I'd see trying to pet him. He was choosy. Very choosy.

As I got to know his fiery spirit, and his telltale raspy yowl, I slowly came around to the idea that my angel was a hellraiser. I went through a difficult time of wondering if I was encouraging Tyrion's tyranny. I fretted and asked neighbors about him. Did he have a home after all?

"Thanks for the question. It's an interesting one. I don't have a definite answer because I haven't spent time trying to report on that issue, specifically. In Houston, which credits its housing-first approach with helping to reduce its unsheltered population, I did ask officials whether the city is a magnet for people from other parts of Texas and other parts of the country. Their answer was, ""No.""

They said most people experiencing homelessness in the Houston area are from the area or nearby. There have been a lot of homeless veterans in Houston partly because there are a lot military bases in the area and therefore many people leaving the military settling in the area. Houston doesn't have any set program where it buses homeless people back to where they're from.

In San Francisco, on the other hand, officials and people working with the homeless were open about the fact that many people on the streets in the city are from elsewhere. They said San Francisco has always been a magnet for people. And San Francisco does have a set program busing people elsewhere. But San Francisco isn't known as a model for the housing-first approach.

"From the article: ""The audiences that gather in the Grotto of the Rendezvous each Tuesday are small, but the intimacy feeds the easygoing connection between the crowd and comics of all experience levels, even when the jokes don’t quite land.""

In other words: nobody goes to these shows and most jokes are not funny.  Feeling ""connected"" is more important than being funny.

No wonder Christopher Hitchens wrote an entire essay explaining why women aren't funny.  As a female Hitchens fan, a comedy fan, and one who considers herself pretty funny, I initially was irked at his thesis.  After more thought, I began to understand what he was trying to say - this article supports his stance.  Male comedians are often short, funny looking, chubby - often the brunt of jokes themselves while growing up.  Many will describe terrible childhoods of getting bullied, etc...but they manage to overcome and grow a skin thick enough to eventually let the hecklers roll of their backs and push on.

But somehow, the average female comedian needs coddling and protecting.

"Well, we aren't talking about *my* money, but I have spent a lot of time working with landlords and I find it amazing how people make all the tenants someone out of a Dickens novel and the landlords either Scrooge or a faceless wealthy money grubbing villain. The truth lies in the middle. 

1.  If you are talking about apartment buildings, some were bought by a single person and the person (usually a guy) comes by and fixes them up. Very invested very personalized. Think blood sweat and tears. Maybe in it for the long haul maybe less, but guaranteed he hasn't see a return yet. He prays his tenants make their rent each month or the mortgage isn't paid. 
2.  Multiple building apartments with corporate owners- money oriented. They may be friendly but they are bottom line dollar. Rules are rules and they hire people who can follow them without being questioned.
3. Property management companies usually have a bunch of private owners who live out of state or are old or too busy to take care of the place. They are paid a fee, but the owners usually care a LOT about who lives in their house, because many times it's a family home or second home, etc. PM don't seem to like to have houses that compete with each other in price so they usually tell the owner what the market can withstand. Sometimes that is below the mortgage sometimes above, they still have to pay the PM also.

4. Private Landlords they can have 1 house or dozens. They are usually invested in the property. Hopefully they know their fh laws. They tend to be more flexible in their rules and they often charge less than market rate. They also aren't paying the PM company fees. They often times have their retirement, life savings tied up in these places. They may not have played the stock market. They bought real estate. 

Being a landlord is a crap shoot. You can get a renter who you think is the very best who moves in his meth gf and her prison kids and your beautiful house is stripped and destroyed. You can rent to a single mom of 4 who keeps it clean and runs the place like a military school. I have seen houses destroyed by white collar workers and apartments scrubbed clean by meth addicts who wanted their 450 deposit back. A little empathy for everyone would be good. It isn't helping ANYONE for the rental market to be this high. The landlords pay more taxes, they have to put their places out there and people are so desperate. It does feel like something out of a Dicken's Novel at this point though. Been evicted? gone to jail? got a full-time job (even with a college degree but only pays $35-40K)? you are screwed for getting housing. And if you are on SSI or SSDI and make $733 and you haven't made the list for subsidized housing because you haven't been evicted yet so they consider you stably housed even though 90% of your income goes to your housing, yeah, that happens regularly too. This isn't JUST about regular housing going up past where middle class can afford. NO one but the wealthiest can find a place. And if you move into an apartment with family, you risk getting them evicted because you're not on the lease but the social agencies then don't consider you literally homeless because you are sleeping on someone's floor. Our system is broken. It isn't just on the backs of landlords. It is everywhere.

"It's not really about infilling that particular line with more stops, it's about expanding the network in general so it becomes more like a grid of stops.  

But the thing that concerns me, which I think agrees with your point, is that Link isn't really sure if it is a regional transportation system or a city subway system.  It kinda tries to be both, which is problematic because it then won't do either all that well.  In European cities, take Berlin as an example, you'll have something like the U-Bahn for fast in-city trips with close spacing of stops and the S-Bahn for longer trips to the outskirts (and places like the airport) with stops spaced further apart.

"Um, note that homeless people and drunk youth tend to congregate in the same neighbourhoods, with the result that you can't assume all littering and vandalism is us rather than them.  That said, there's certainly examples that are distinctively ours, just as there are others that are distinctively theirs; so yeah, I hear you.

One element is that it's a *nuisance* to carry trash to a bin, when you also have to carry all your stuff too.  I tend to do a fair amount of planning so I can avoid having trash around me at night without making that kind of trip.  This is especially true when it's raining.  (I don't know about other homeless people, but I take time drying my shoe soles on rainy nights before getting into my sleeping bag.  No *way* do I want to walk out of that doorway and have to do that again.)

I think there's some not caring and some not knowing.  But I think ""jealousy"" isn't quite right.  Anger, more probably.  Taking a chance to get revenge for the badness of your life, not caring whether your target deserves it.

One thing I've noticed is that people leave cardboard in doorways a lot, especially if it's gotten wet.  This is obviously inconsiderate, but the logistical problems of getting rid of it are non-trivial for homeless people just as they are for the people who get stuck with it.  One obvious solution would be for people who use cardboard to get real sleeping bag pads, but I can't see that working on a larger scale.

I don't talk with the people who make this kind of mess, so I don't really know what they're thinking.  They offend me, because they're making people think worse of me, too.

One night I slept one doorway over from this guy who was behaving really oddly.  He had a fancy expensive sleeping bag, and lots of fancy expensive food, which he was consuming right there in the bag, making a mess.  In the morning, I found he had left me his leftovers.  I'm pretty sure he was some well-off guy trying to find out how the other half lived, and I despised him, but I ate well for a few days off what he apparently thought of as poverty food.

"I've been ignoring your questions for a long time now, not because I think they're bad questions, but because I really have no idea how to answer them.  Once here on the UW campus I ran into some students who asked something similar; it was autumn, and I answered ""blankets"".  But actually the only blanket I've been given, I've long suspected of having bed bugs, and I rarely use it.

A friend of mine wanted me to tell him the URL for this thread once it started, and I didn't do so.  Shame on me.  That said, he wanted to point out that one reason for homelessness in Seattle in particular is Amazon's hiring spree, which is essentially inflationary on the whole city.  I don't see that he's wrong, there, but I don't share his belief that there's an easy answer.

However, this does have implications.  To the extent that we all rely on Amazon rather than local retailers, we replace jobs that keep people housed with fewer jobs that keep people rich.

Since I've already said in this thread that I expect to be working through Amazon myself soon, I'm not one to throw any stones.  But I do want to say that it's much easier to prevent homelessness than to cure it, and supporting local businesses seems like an obvious way to help do so.

He would go from one side to the other, move back a few spaces, the work his way through the crowd again.  The old guy finally calmed down and left, and the shady split right quick.

"As someone who has volunteered for KEXP in a technical capacity I can tell you they've got some very hard working engineers there working on it. How can it be this way?

Imagine having to work on a complicated system that was put in place by some volunteers who donated some very complex industrial grade systems and architected it as if it were going to be run and maintained by a commercial operation, but then just handed it over to a radio station with a handful of engineers dedicated to it. Maybe a few other volunteers bolted stuff onto it in ways they should not have over time. None of your bosses are technical, they run a radio station. So in this environment your small engineering team's job is to fix the current system which is very complex, and very high maintenance, but also navigate the politics and unique conditions of a non-profit while also helping maintain a website that is responsible for driving in large donations to keep the station running. Maybe throw in the fact that the parent company providing IT support didn't renew their agreement, so your workload just doubled, on a good day. You also provide internal IT support. Then move everything into a new building. Oh, and rebrand everything all at the same time.

They're always looking for volunteers to help. This town is drowning in software engineers, but surprisingly few offer their time and talent to the station. And when they do, they often engineer things like they would at their day job, often big, complex, expensive, and poorly documented. Speaking from experience, after a day working for my paycheck, volunteering to do it all over again at night and on weekends when Seattle and its summer weather is sparkling is very difficult. 

So that's one way it happens. KEXP is a radio station paid for by donations. It's not Amazon or Google. They are attempting, and achieving, great things. There is no other radio station like it on the planet and, in my opinion, it's a damn good one. I've volunteered there some and they've got some very talented, very hard working engineers there and they are working their asses off doing a lot of stuff while wearing a lot of hats.

"&gt;But what laws has he broken?

Dude (or dudette), you are conflating a bunch of things. Whether or not he is breaking some kind of law (which CLEARLY he isn't) has nothing to do with whether Microsoft wants an employee on their payroll who is publicly know for advocating physical violence against women for ""breaking up a family"" by not wearing a hijab.

If there is an employment agreement that dictates hiring and firing at microsoft, they would obviously need to follow that. But almost all of these agreements have conditions for how actions you take outside of work can cause you to be fired.

And if there is no employee agreement at microsoft (not likely), then we live in an ""at-will"" state; meaning you can be fired without notice for any reason or no reason at all without any notice; and you can also leave any job for any reason or no reason at all with no notice.

I bought at 60% of what I was approved for. My wife felt like we must not being doing things wrong because others had so many more things. Eventually when they started losing homes it became clear how poorly others had actually thought this through. Only buy what makes sense financially. It's a house first, and an investment only in the sense that it will return some of your money whereas rent returns none of it.

"Hey Joe. Thanks for doing this AMA.

I work downtown. Just yesterday an older homeless guy walked into our office in a private office building and asked if anyone could help him get on his feet. Long story short, we've had incidents in the building with men walking in and allegedly harassing people, so everyone is on edge when this happens. (To be clear, we don't do anything related to helping the homeless. People just wander into the building from the street because the doors aren't locked during the day.)

I try to be compassionate when this happens, but I'm also at work in the middle of the day. I let the guy use the bathroom because he  was confused and said he was going to pee his pants. Then he asked if I could just spend 10 minutes helping him figure out how to ""get on his feet."" I knew I was not equipped with that knowledge, and this is far from the first time someone's asked me for help like this, so I told him I was sorry but I had to walk him out. A few hours later, a young girl in similar circumstances walked in asking to use the bathroom.

My question is: What can the average person like myself do in situations like this? I want to be compassionate and helpful, but I'm also trying to go about my work day and not take on another adult as my responsibility. This guy said he wasn't interested in shelters -- he wanted help finding work or a couch to sleep on, etc. I don't want to turn a blind eye to this guy, but realistically I can't give him a job and I don't want a stranger on my couch. Obviously everyone is different, but what -- if any -- do you think is a good general response/approach to these situations?",,,,jimmyslaysdragons,Ravenna,,1467240920,t5_2qhad,t3_4qhue6,t3_4qhue6,22,1469385730,0,0,d4t8wox,Seattle,22,,flair

"I hate entitled pedestrians. Sure, the law says that all cars should yield to them, but I'm all about efficiency.  It takes 2 seconds to let me pass in front of you, but 30 seconds for me to wait for you to pass in front of me, not to mention the wasted fuel of having to accelerate again instead of maintaining constant speed. 

The most dangerous part of a car is the front end, so you should want to avoid that area as much as possible.  So waiting until a car passes allows you to walk behind the car where you are less likely to be hit AND the car doesn't have to wait. 

If there is a controlled intersection (stop sign, light, etc), then waiting for a pedestrian is fine.  You have to stop anyway.  It's these uncontrolled intersections that people on foot think they own the road when there are 2 ton hunks of metal flying around at 30+mph.  There might be laws that supposedly protect the pedestrians.  But it's not about who's right, it about who's left.

If you have to wait 1 min to for a few cars to pass until there is an opening to cross, that delays your travel by 3 hundredths of a mile.  If a car going 25 mph has to wait for a pedestrian to cross, it delays them AND EVERY CAR BEHIND THEM by 1/4 of a mile every time someone wants to cross without waiting.  

Whenever I'm walking, I respect other peoples time.  I make sure that I wait until it's clear to cross and if I know I'm going to make a car slow down or stop, I cross as fast as reasonably possible.

"As someone who rides a motorcycle in Seattle quite often,  I wish scooters and their riders would just go away.  Seriously  I know it won't be a popular opinion but an experienced rider doesn't go down because of tracks.  She refuses to accept that she is to blame for her crash not the tracks.  She was only going  10-15mph she had plenty of time to see the tracks and react appropriatly. 

The problem is that you do not need a motorcycle endorsement to ride a scooter in WA.  Any idiot over  16 with a driver's license can ride one. 


She brags she had over 1000mi on the scooter like that makes her an expert. That's not even enough to break in the motor.   I have well over  185,000mi on two wheels including track time and a club level racing license.  I wouldn't call myself an expert, but I do have some experience.

"Leaving aside the fact that he does this for a living, costing Washington tax payers hundreds of thousands of dollars in court challenges (due to the fact that some are simply unconstitutional)...

...Washington's tax structure is already FUBAR. Absent an income tax, the state generally and municipalities in particular rely on fees, sales taxes, and property taxes to keep the wheels of government turning. When some of those wheels stop, it's the people at the bottom of the rung who get hit the hardest. See: McCleary decision, where we have underfunded education so much that it's in violation of the state Constitution. See: mental health treatment, where Washington is near the bottom of the nation.

People outside of Snohomish, Pierce, and King counties have this idea that Seattle takes all of the money for the state. They **don't** realize that all but 4 counties in the state get more tax money from Olympia than they contribute.

Eyman's initiatives prey on that ignorance with cleverly titled names and text that actively makes Washington a worse place to live in for *everyone*, even those who vote for them.

It's deceptive. It's actively harmful. And he does it because it makes him money.

Yes, it's democratic, in a sense of the word. But there's a reason we have a republic and not a direct democracy--direct democracy **doesn't work** for sufficiently large populations, because the harm of the majority decision is insulated from the majority. Only the minority feels it.

"I feel like I should drop this here: http://www.assaultweapon.info/

I'd like to preface that I myself am a gun owner, and partake in both ""sporting"" activities and ""going out in the woods being a redneck"" activities too. To me, *responsible* gun ownership is all about promoting safety, not being a dumbass, and most of all, having fun. It's a terrible tragedy whenever some sick freak decides to take their own twisted agenda out on innocent people, but I hardly think that banning cosmetic and ease of use features on a certain 'look' of rifle will be productive, and all you will end up doing is pissing off a bunch of tax paying, gun owning, citizens, who will be belligerent towards enforcement efforts.

Regardless of which side of the pro/anti gun fence that you side on, I think that what we really need to be doing is focusing on increasing the effectiveness of our background check program. I'm the rare gun owner that thinks it shouldn't take 10 minutes to go buy a gun - I've got my FFL, I've got my CPL, I've paid my taxes and done my background check, and there's no reason nobody else should be able to do that either (sans for the tax portion, but perhaps that could be prorated based on income level). At the same time, I think that we should look at diverting a tiny amount of funds away from existing programs to fund a program that promotes mental health as well.

"This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](http://komonews.com/news/local/soccer-star-hope-solo-loses-bid-to-have-domestic-violence-trial-canceled) reduced by 81%. (I'm a bot)
*****
&gt; Hope Solo, Seattle&amp;#039;s star goalie who led the U.S. soccer team to the Women&amp;#039;s World Cup title last year, has lost her latest bid to have domestic violence charges against her thrown out and her trial canceled.

&gt; Solo initially was charged with two counts of fourth-degree domestic violence after the June 2014 incident at the home of her half-sister, Teresa L. Obert.

&gt; No trial date has been set, and it was not immediately clear if Solo intends to appeal the latest decision to the state Supreme Court.

"Short answer:  yes, this is legal.  Since you are in a month-to-month contract, your landlord can give you 60 days notice for any rent increase over 10%.  You are not protected from changes in rent while in month-to-month leases.

[Source](http://www.tenantsunion.org/en/rights/rule-changes-rent-increases):
&gt;A landlord cannot change any aspect of a lease during the fixed-term period except by mutual agreement. Therefore, rent is fixed during the lease term. In month-to-month tenancies, however, landlords can change the rules of tenancy more easily. In fact, the landlord is only required to give tenants 30 days written notice to change a term of the tenancy, including a rent increase (RCW 59.18.140). An exception to this general rule concerns a rent increase in the City of Seattle where a tenant is entitled to 60 days prior written notice for an increase 10% or more in a 12-month period (SMC 7.24.030).",,,,thedivegrass,Lower Queen Anne,,1466031455,t5_2qhad,t3_4oa5ew,t3_4oa5ew,16,1469068137,0,0,d4auxcr,Seattle,16,,flair

"Again, the money isn't really an issue for me because the number is so small but, yes, it does ""cost"" because it's the elimination of an expected revenue source. Anytime a large law enforcement agency makes a purchase decision they factor resale into their budgeting. They do it with cars, computers, radios, guns, everything. Choosing now to destroy these guns puts a hole in budgeting projections. Holes mean either cutting a corner somewhere else, which usually means more outlays in the long run, or increasing future funding requests. Taxpayers either get less service than they paid for or they pay more for equitable service.

The Seattle Police Department uses Glock, usually the Glcok 17. A no frills Gen4 Glock 17 can be had for about $500, new. A well maintained used Gen4 Glock 17 can be had for about $400 to $450. Glocks are the Hondas of pistols, they don't greatly depreciate in value as long as they are taken care of. 

There are plenty of gun manufacturers who sell brand new full-size 9mm handguns at used Glock prices, such as Taurus. Gun demand is also notoriously inelastic in relation to price; it's much more responsive to technology and political events. All of this means that if used Glocks are removed from the market, there will not be an appreciable drop in overall sales, only that more new firearms will be made to makeup for the lost used pistol inventory at that price point.",,,,CalvinMcManus,Seattle Expatriate,,1467156764,t5_2qhad,t3_4qbbar,t1_d4ruzgc,17,1469362191,0,0,d4rvupe,Seattle,17,,flair

One thing I’ve always appreciated about the Montlake Market (aka the Hop-In) is the huge variety of people who shop there. Because of its location, people from all backgrounds shop there and mingle while waiting for their sandwich or coffee. It’s the type of place Seattle needs more of, not less.

Commandeer its parking lot if you must, or stage items at the parking lot at the east end of East Miller Street (on what Google Maps is calling the “WSDOT Peninsula”), but please don’t destroy a business that is a critical part of the area. Businesses cannot just bounce back after something like this, and the fabric of the neighborhood will be permanently harmed for residents, commuters, and all of the thousands who come to the Montlake Market each week.”",,,,bigjoshhhhhhhhh,Montlake,,1467215233,t5_2qhad,t3_4qg05e,t1_d4snnr3,14,1469375731,0,0,d4so4w1,Seattle,14,,flair

I would suggest punching your numbers into a [rent vs buy calculator](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/upshot/buy-rent-calculator.html) to see what makes sense for your finances and plans. If renting makes more sense, then do that and dump the rest you would have spent on housing into investments. Having to rent is no reason not to invest in your future.

"I think there are a number of ways to read what you responded to, and the way I read it doesn't deserve your response.  It's hard to read intent online, but it might be best to give the benefit of the doubt as a good default.

When they say ""'some feminists' should move to Europe."" I don't see it as ""go away somewhere more liberal"" or even discussing feminists.  ""some feminists"" was the name the defacer(s) gave theirsel(f/ves), so I read it as simply a reference to that entity.  Moving to Europe seems to go with the next part of the post, which says that there is a history of nudity in art in Europe.  So the way I read it all together, it just seemed to be saying that ""if you think America has too-lenient attitudes to nudity, check out Europe"".  A ""broaden your perspective"" type of response.

I don't know that that is what was intended, but if it was a ""go away where you are more wanted"" kind of attack trying to conflate feminism and liberal European ideologies, I don't see a way to understand the nudity reference and I think an attack specifically on feminism wouldn't have quoted ""some feminists"", the same name as given by the defacer(s).

"Great article a while back in the stranger (http://www.thestranger.com/features/feature/2015/07/08/22508752/where-to-swim-in-seattle).  I have been swimming outdoors (when temps permit) for years and love it.  There are rules though...you can't swim 50 yards from shore without a boat (I will find the law and add it just to confirm).   For me, 59 degrees is probably the coldest I would swim - but there is a group that swims off Alki YEAR ROUND (http://say-yes-to-life-swims.com) 

You need to be sure and check for bacterial levels of the lakes: 
http://green2.kingcounty.gov/swimbeach/

1. My favorite spot is probably Madison Park Beach, they have a long rope that they put up that you can swim on either side of...and the people generally swim laps at that spot.  
2. I also swim out at Idylwood park - they also have a rope they put out for lap swimming, but it is in Redmond on the Eastside.  A number of people swim the buoys out there, but illegal because it is so far from shore...I have seen people ticketed (not kidding - they get put in a boat, ticketed and ferried back to shore).  
3.  They have lap swimming at Lake Washington in Bellevue, but I hate the drive and traffic so I have never been there. 

There are tons of open water swim events this summer: 
Greenlake Open Water Swim 
Bloodworks Swim across Lake Washington 
Friday night open water swims (competition - Kent area). 

Let me know if you have any questions.

"Text of article (ST paywalled):

&gt;OLYMPIA — A Snohomish County judge has ordered Tim Eyman to comply with subpoenas demanding financial and business records, the Washington state Attorney General’s Office said Wednesday.

&gt;The order comes after State Attorney General Bob Ferguson earlier this month accused the anti-tax activist of withholding documents sought by subpoena in an investigation into alleged campaign-disclosure violations.

&gt;Last autumn, a state Public Disclosure Commission (PDC) investigation alleged that in 2012, Eyman improperly used money raised for one measure, Initiative 1185, for another one he was working on, Initiative 517.

&gt;After releasing its investigative report, the PDC voted to refer the investigation to the Attorney General’s Office, after PDC staff concluded that the commission’s potential penalties were too small for the allegations.

&gt;The subpoenas have sought Eyman’s tax returns, as well as bank statements dating to 2009.

&gt;Snohomish County Superior Court Judge Ellen Fair ordered Eyman to not only comply with AG’s subpoenas, but also to pay costs and fees related to the state’s efforts to enforce them, according to an email by a spokesman for the Attorney General’s Office.

&gt;In an email, Eyman’s attorney wrote that the judge’s order allows personal information relating to Eyman’s family to remain private.

&gt;“My client has offered this information to the AG for six months as long as his family’s personal information would remain private,” wrote Mark Lamb. “ I’m pleased the Judge’s order will allow that to occur.”

&gt;As part of its investigation, the Attorney General’s Office has also asked for subpoenas to be enforced In Thurston County Superior Court against the for-profit signature gathering firm Citizen Solutions.

&gt;The company and its principals, Roy Ruffino and William Agazarm, are scheduled to appear in court July 1, the AG’s office said.",,,,BestSeattle,,,1467234665,t5_2qhad,t3_4qhy3q,t3_4qhy3q,16,1469383527,0,0,d4t4drf,Seattle,16,,

"Landlord here.  Two quickies.

1) The non-refundable fees seem high.  The overall deposit is low if anything.  I usually ask for a month's rent in deposit.  If the tenants leave the place rentable, I refund every penny.  If I have to work, I get grouchy.  If the fees are spelled out explicitly in the lease though, they're legal.  You can try to ask for a break, but given the rental market, the odds are not good.

2) My experience with pets has been this.  They are either no trouble at all, or they cause thousands of dollars of damage.  There is nothing in between.

If you're curious about the mechanics, usually a cat or a dog with a pee problem doesn't just hit the carpet.  Unless the tenants are incredibly fastidious, the pee goes through to the padding and then to the underfloor.  Replacing carpet is not very expensive in general.  Replacing underfloor is a whole 'nother story.

I was very fortunate to have a tenant who worked through the problem with me.  But it was a problem with a mid four digit solution.",,,,wumingzi,North Beacon Hill,,1466652476,t5_2qhad,t3_4pekln,t3_4pekln,14,1469231840,0,0,d4kceje,Seattle,14,,flair

"**Are there any factors that makes Seattle's homelessness situation unique?**

Thanks for your question. There are a few factors that people working on the issue in Seattle talk about in terms of the city having more people experiencing homelessness than some others. One is housing affordability. Our rents and home prices are high compared to other cities and they've been getting higher. Another is people coming here for jobs, because of Seattle's reputation as having a lot of jobs, and then getting stuck here, away from their support networks. Another is the comparatively robust services our government and organizations offer to people experiencing homelessness. I don't know which of those factors is most important, and there are others, but those are thing I hear people talk about a lot.

**What do you see as the most effective way of getting homeless people off the streets, and where should the funding come from for such programs? What can the average citizen do to make a positive, lasting difference for the homeless in the area?**

&gt;You seem to assume that there aren't good reasons to be opposed ST3, even though they've laid out several.

This specific article is vague  (""There’s no silver bullet"", ""Board members should consider a leaner Plan B that would continue extending the system’s north and south spine. It should rely more on flexible, rapid buses and less on costly, fixed light rail duplicating current bus routes"") and contradictory (""This will take large investments"", ""would cost King County homeowners about $20,000 over 25 years"", ""might limit the public’s ability to finance other important work"", so we need to make a large investment, this costs ""homeowners"" less than 1k per year, but this might somehow hurt the children).

From the PI article:

&gt;""What this driver noticed on I-90 is what we call a dowel bar retrofit. As a roadway ages the material underneath the concrete panels can settle unevenly, causing the panels to tip back and forth like a see-saw. When the panels tip, they can also crack and separate, damaging the roadway and causing a rough ride for drivers. To help prevent this we cut holes into the concrete, insert two sets of three steel rods (dowel bars) into the pavement where two concrete panels connect, fill the hole with grout, and grind it so it's smooth. The dowel bars we insert into the pavement tie the panels together to make them stronger and prevent them from tipping or cracking, which extends the life of the pavement and gives drivers a smoother ride.""

"There are two types of suburban dwellers who are opposed to this: 

1) People who understand how regional transit and subsidies work but they are pricks and don't want to contribute to their region in the slightest, even though the large city is the reason their suburbs exists in the first place.

2) People who have no idea how subsidized their suburban living is by federal and state government, no idea how much their own livelihoods rely on the success of the large city they are adjacent to, and/or no idea how regional transit systems affect the entire region.

Improving regional transit will affect you positively, even if you don't ever use it.

"&gt;MUCH tougher terrain

Compared to Seattle, Denver is flatter with no major hills, waterways or lakes. Also, Denver was able to take advantage of old railroad right of ways to build out rail quickly.

&gt;less tax revenue from business

Majority of transit in Seattle is funded through the Sales Tax. No business taxes go to transit.

Other things to keep in mind, most of the light rail in Denver runs at grade with no underground sections. It is much cheaper and faster to build everything at grade, particularly on city streets and existing railroad right of way but you reduce reliability. Tunneling takes longer but you end up with a more reliable product.

last time i was there there were bike racks on the far right side (as you look at the terminal) but rumor is they might have been taken out and if i remember right they were taken out with some bikes still attached to it. there's a sidewalk from 99 that you can bike right up to the terminal on. 

also, you might want to leave a bike there that you don't care too much about. good chance that it'll lose some parts over an extended stay.

"/u/Ansible32 is spot-on... I enjoy posts about events around town, provided the OP is transparent. (i.e., not using reddit as an opportunity for increasing attendance numbers at someone's personal event and calling it a reddit meetup)

I was also reminded of recent news of a known predator being continuously deleted because someone said his name. He was luring women to ""photo shoots"" and attempting to drug/rape them. There were multiple accounts of this happening. People should be allowed to share their stories on a community forum. If the guy wanted to come here to defend himself, he could have done that.

It turns out that guy was a ""friend"" of mine on facebook. I drive an artcar so I have 1700+ ""friends,"" most of whom are just people who like the car. I often get asked to do time-for-print photoshoots. I pick the time and place, and I'm always sober because I have to drive. Other ladies may not have such restrictions. Even though they should, that guy shouldn't be out trying to rape people in the first place. Shortly after the cryptic /r/Seattle post, someone on facebook shared this guy's identity with me, and I appreciate the heads-up.

"When I read this article I had the same thought as u/Icabezudo, I've been riding a combination of dirt bikes and motorcycles for 20 years, I'm 29 now. 


When riding over painted roadways and metal surfaces you must ride completely perpendicular to the metal and at an upright angle when going over painted surfaces. If you fail to do this you will most likely lowside and crash.


I believe U/Icabezudo was not trying to be smug but more just tired of people not taking responsibility for their own mistakes, and this is what happened to the scooter rider she made a mistake. Every rider makes mistakes and goes down at some point in their riding career, hopefully like this scooter rider it's relatively small and doesn't cost them their life. 


Also what u/Icabezudo is also trying to convey is imagine if this person was on a motorcycle and not a scooter there would be no article and everyone would say that it was their fault and they should learn to ride.

"Briefly, something I've heard from many people on the street in Seattle, San Francisco and Houston is that some people experiencing homelessness are preyed upon by others who are living on the street and also by people with housing.

Regarding mental health, Mayor Murray has repeatedly said he believes Seattle needs more help from state lawmakers when it comes to that. His often talks about Washington being near last among U.S. states in funding for mental health.

Regarding drug addiction, I should point out that the city and county recently set up a task force on the heroin epidemic: http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/health/new-task-force-to-tackle-heroin-epidemic-in-seattle-king-county/ The task force hasn't released any recommendations yet.

One other thing to watch for... Mayor Murray announced last week the city will open up a 24/7 shelter in the style of San Francisco's Navigation Center. Just yesterday, SF lawmakers approved a plan to create additional such Navigation Center facilities there but shot down a proposal that would have made those facilities (or at least one of those sites?) safe-consumption sites -- sites where people are allowed to use illegal drugs under supervision: http://m.sfgate.com/politics/article/Supervisors-compromise-on-plan-for-six-new-8156642.php. Safe-consumption sites are a topic of discussion here, as well: http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/heroin-other-drug-users-may-get-a-safe-use-site-in-seattle/ So far, Mayor Murray's Navigation Center plan doesn't include a safe-consumption component, but some advocates here may push for that.",,,,DanielBeekman,Seattle Times City Hall Reporter Daniel Beekman,,1466019660,t5_2qhad,t3_4o8y24,t1_d4akdh4,10,1469063828,0,0,d4alxnp,Seattle,10,,flair verified

"I think the argument goes that currently nearly ALL commuters must use the roads.  Shifting that "" small percentage of the population, in certain geographical areas"" (which, btw is expected to be 350,000 DAILY riders in 2030 from all neighborhoods served by lightrail) to lightrail frees up the streets and highways for people who don't live in the city, who aren't served by light rail, or who for whatever reason don't use transit to use the streets.

It's expensive, but Seattle's geography makes transit complicated.  Grade separated light rail is proven fast, and reliable.

"Ok if you want the whole back story: Intent was to leave the keys with my girlfriend, but in my rush to get out the door to the airport I stuffed them in my pocket out of habit.  Didn't notice what I'd done until it was too late.

I wasn't too worried though, as our street had a couple of cars that never moved (including a neat old Dart with a permanently flat tire).  In my head, the worst case scenario would be I'd get the 72 hour sticker on the window and I'd overnight the key home. 

Didn't expect the city to come by and give us less than 24 hours notice.  Really didn't expect the towing turd lady to revel so in my misfortune. 

But hey, lesson learned and recurring bloody revenge fantasy acquired.  

Oh and a bonus indignity - I had to pay for a months stay in an expensive hotel out of pocket (to be reimbursed later). But after paying the locksmith I was going to be short so I had to spend the last few nights hiding out in the office until everyone left and then sleeping in the rodent infested storage room.

Bet that story would have tickled Lincoln lady pink. Would have split her Marlboro jacket from laughing.  All looking like dog the bounty hunter rolling around on the floor in her own greasy piss laughing and laughing. Pulls out a picture of starving orphans and starts laughing harder.

"I think the markets will panic for a couple weeks and then things will settle down.  The dissolution process will take years (likely to be mutually extended after the 2-year limit) and there's nothing stopping the UK from signing a new trade treaty with EU that covers a large percentage of what they'd otherwise lose from a clean break.

Plus, UK is on the pound, not the euro, so that's much less of a crisis than it otherwise would be.

I'm actually interested to see this process play out.  I think they'll end up being an EU member in everything but name.  They'll sign separate treaties and drop some of the regulations to make people happy and then go about business as usual.  If Scotland gains independence to rejoin the EU, that will be fascinating to watch.

"The good: 

-  If you work during the day, that's a reverse commute so most of the time the wait is minimal.  
-  The ride is nice and gives you some downtime to work, read, or have a beer. 
-  Vashon is pretty relaxed and overall a cool place. 

The less good: 

-  Having your schedule dictated by the ferry can be frustrating.  
-  Even without a long wait to get on, you're looking at around 45 minutes to an hour each way when you count waiting, loading and unloading, and the drive on-island to your workplace.  
-  Delays are not uncommon.  
-  The cost.  

If you're going to do it though, I'd suggest getting a motorcycle or scooter.  You get priority boarding and unloading, so not only do you eliminate a lot of waiting, you're pretty much guaranteed not to miss a boat as long as you get there within 5-10 minutes of the departure time.  And the fare's lower. 

Same goes for walking on as long as you can swing transportation once you're on the island.

At that point, we reach the downhill part where the highway turns left. He never turns and goes directly into the wall. We stop behind him and call the cops.

"It's all just scary, how rent can go to a ridiculous amount, yet someone will pay it and others will suffer for it (""Well my landlord friend raised his $1800 a month property to $4000 a month, and it rented right away. I'm a landlord, I should do that too, to all my properties!"") and sure enough people will pay and people will fight for it.

Our rent after four years went up a hundred dollars. Not bad, we're lucky and we know it. But to rent in the same area, same size, and have exactly what we have now and no more no less it would cost us at least another $1500 a month on top of what we already pay. To pay that would mean we wouldn't make the ""Must make more than 3x's the rent."" requirement. To buy a home with the above criteria, no more, no less, same area, no uprooting the kids, no leaving friends and places we know, it would cost us around $850k, our mortgage would be about 500 more than rent what we're paying now. It would hurt, but what hurts is a few years ago before we moved here and we looked at buying they were 150-200k less and we could have afforded that a month but didn't have the money down. Also it's sad to have to pay so much more and really get nothing more, no extra room, no bigger yard, no newer features, just a home with some rooms that you hope in some years you can afford to make a little nicer.

We're lucky we make enough to get by, lucky to be able to buy some things that we want and just not what we need. But the rental problem is truly out of hand, not just QA, not just downtown, or Ballard, or even Wallingford, it's bad all over. The places north and south now know people are scrambling to them, therefore the rent there goes up like here. It's a never ending cycle that you can't escape if you want to live anywhere near where you work, or where your life is.

My son asked me last night after seeing a cool looking house online a friend posted ""If we didn't live in Seattle, where would you want to live?"" And the places I mentioned were so much more to live in before we came here, but now sound cheap and now sound like we'd actually have a lot of money left each month after bills, a real bit of a break so to speak. Thing is, I don't want to leave Seattle, or leave being so close to downtown, and close to so many things my kids love, it's our home now. The city welcomed us and made us love her when we were only supposed to be here for a six month job then move back East.

"History and zoning has a lot to do with it, at least along Aurora.  Even in the Residential Urban Village of Aurora-Licton it is [primarily C1 and C2 zoning along Aurora](http://www.auroralictonuv.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/aurora-licton-springs-sf-zones-1.png) which is auto-oriented zoning.  These are not the types of businesses that ""activate"" a street and have people walking around doing stuff.  It's more like self-storage buildings, car lots, and auto-repair places.  On top of that, C1 will oftentimes not have housing and C2 pretty much forbids it, so there is almost no reason for anyone to be walking around there.  

I also think that north of 85th has long been ignored by the city.  The new districts should begin to shine lights on under-served areas.  I could be wrong, but I don't think any of the previous incumbent City Council members lived north of 85th.  With absolutely nothing to back me up, I have a sneaking suspicion there have been very few, if any, that have lived north of 85th since it's been part of the city.

But like others have commented, these sorts of businesses need to exist somewhere.  I just think that more and more people are living on the fringes of these historical commercial districts as the population moves further northward, so it has become more noticeable.  The city hasn't been able to keep up with the demand of the new residents and make necessary changes.",,,,PizzaSounder,,,1464810826,t5_2qhad,t3_4m2uqy,t3_4m2uqy,34,1468744619,0,0,d3s5p4r,Seattle,34,,

"According to a Twitter conversation they had this morning, they still don't have enough ridership to justify all trains being three cars long. There is enough to justify an increase in three car trains at peak hours, even above what they've done already.
