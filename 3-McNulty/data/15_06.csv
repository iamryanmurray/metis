My tldr preview: Rent control limits rent increases. Owners can't kick out renters. Renters pay less than market rate. Over time this may cause owners to owe more in property taxes than they collect in rent. So property tax is capped just like rent is capped. The rate is recalculated if the property is sold.

"[Needs to be said:](http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2012/04/17/243879.htm)

 - The first 30 days of a motorcyclist's riding career are 4 times as dangerous as his or her entire second year.

 - 22% of accidents occur within 30 days of a motorcycle insurance policy being activated.

Anecdotally:  Seattle is a ""ride once"" kind of place.  The rate of attrition between Year 1 and Year 2 is really high anywhere; combine that with the fact that riding in Seattle can be semi-unpleasant six months out of the year and you find a lot of people who buy a bike in May, drop it in June, wipe out in July, nurse their road rash in August, garage it in September, sell it in October and spend the next 40 years of their life bragging about how they used to ride motorcycles.  I've known people who will buy Craigslist Harleys in October-November-December, garage them until April/May/June and then turn them around for $1k-$2k profit.  Seattle is crazy predictable.  

So yes.  A lot of the motorcyclists you're looking out for are idiots.  That doesn't mean they don't bleed.  That doesn't mean they aren't otherwise decent people temporarily drunk on a power-to-weight ratio that would make an F430 scuderia whimper (been there, done that).  Most of us aren't the least bit interested in driving in your blind spot, kicking your door for checking your email at a stop light or tailgating you because you're only going 6mph over the speed limit.  Most of us have done this for a while and have learned that there isn't a single MVA where we come out on top.  Most of us have had our brushes with mortality, know full well just how easily situations go from ""god-like"" to ""ass over teakettle"" and *we're in the same traffic.*

So forgive them (us) our trespasses.  After a couple years we've long since learned that not only don't you see us, you never will and that we can take it personally or we can take it into account and ride as if we'd rather not get hit.  But we're not your problem.

And thank your lucky stars every day that you don't live in Los Angeles.

"This paragraph contains the gists of the whole article:

Under Kubly, the Seattle Department of Transportation (SDOT) has laid out an ambitious plan to overhaul the city’s streets. The plan, called Move Seattle, is remarkable in many ways, but none more than this: While it includes maintenance and repair of existing roads, and upgrading bridges to make them earthquake-safe, there are virtually no new accommodations for cars. Instead, it is a plan to more efficiently move people around the city by bus, transit, bike, and on foot.

Here’s a sampling of the initiatives contained therein:

* Seven to 10 “multimodal corridor projects” — that is, travel corridors that incorporate designated space for bikes, buses, and other mass transit.
* Seven new “bus rapid transit” corridors that will hustle riders in and out of the city in designated lanes, separate from car traffic.
* Easy access to buses that arrive at least every 10 minutes, throughout the day, for three-quarters of city residents.
* A build-out of half of the city’s perpetually underfunded bicycle master plan, including 50 miles of protected bike lanes.
* One hundred blocks of new sidewalks, new crossings at 225 intersections, and safe walking and biking routes to all of the city’s schools.
* Reduced speed limits on residential streets of 20 mph, and 30 mph on arterial streets.",false,false,t1_crwo198,creativecoding,,0,1433526111,t5_2qhad,t3_38nr8r,t1_crwn4k1,14,1436756299,0,0,crwo198,Seattle,14,,

Seattle needs to build higher density buildings, it is stupid how low new condo buildings are in Captiol Hill. Public transport needs to improve dramatically to match this.

"First, Gaw Capital Partners is not, to the best of my knowledge a sovereign state.  It's a privately held HK-based real estate trust.

More importantly, here's some basic macroeconomics.

We have what is called a ""current account balance"".  That's how much money goes out of the US to buy foreign goods and services vs how much money comes into the US to buy our goods and services.

One part of that is this annoying number called the trade deficit.  This means we buy more Taiwanese laptops, Chinese cell phones, Bangladeshi fast fashion and German-made BMWs than everyone else buys Boeing airplanes, GM cars and Westinghouse nuclear power plants.

When more money goes out than comes in, our economy and currency gets weak and wobbly in the knees.

So....  Since we don't sell enough stuff you can drop on your foot, the current account balance can be shored up through purchasing US assets.  These include:
1) Purchase of US Treasury Bonds (ZOMG!  The evil Chinese are buying our debt!)
2) Purchase of US equities (ZOMG!  The evil Chinese are buying our corporations!)
3) Purchase of US property (ZOMG!  The evil Chinese are buying our real estate!)

Since you feel that foreigners should not be buying US assets, the real question is ""How are you going to rectify the trade deficit so that we no longer need FDI?"" 

The other question is, should Americans not be allowed to buy foreign assets?  If not, why not?",false,false,t1_cruftpz,wumingzi,North Beacon Hill,0,1433357035,t5_2qhad,t3_38d3qt,t1_cruc4hg,28,1436700140,0,0,cruftpz,Seattle,28,,flair

I can't say I've ever seen a cyclist fully stop at these trail ones unless a car is coming, in which case cars typically won't yield for you to cross.

"I mean, the tea party controls the state senate. They do. We had 5 swing races for the senate this year that if we won them all could have taken back the chamber, and we lost all but 1. It sucks.

In that light, I'm inclined to think we made the right compromises here. The things we got over the republicans' opposition were mostly funding things that need to be gained *right away*. Whereas the climate standards (while no less, and possibly more) important, is also a long-term thing that's gaining more support every year. We're more likely to win it in 2-3 years (and boy would it help if we pried the state senate back by then).

"&gt; both tickets I felt were unfair

Before you head in to court, consider the following: the ticket may be unfair but did you actually break the law?  For example, in Washington and in Seattle specifically, any intersection between two streets is a legal pedestrian crosswalk and you are not allowed to park within 30' of a traffic control device or crosswalk.  If you were too close, you were too close so it might be unfair but also unlawful.

For the second, if the sign is present and at least partially visible--which you say it was--then you must abide by it.  How did the sign being partially obscured cause you to violate its restrictions?  You may have an argument about intent, but most parking rules are ""strict liability,"" where you either did or did not violate the rule and intent doesn't factor in.

Just a thing to note.  Judges and magistrates hear cries of ""it's not fair"" all day long but the law doesn't allow them to rule on fairness--except for, say, civil contracts and other suits of equity, which criminal/administrative law isn't--only matters of law.",false,false,t1_crsu1uz,somenewuser,Central Area,0,1433240123,t5_2qhad,t3_386st7,t3_386st7,10,1436662149,0,0,crsu1uz,Seattle,10,,flair

"I'm honestly not being snarky here- I'd like to hear why this is making you feel so irritable about this?  There are a lot of gay folks that live on Capitol Hill, and the rainbow flag is a longstanding symbol of ""hey, we're cool with gay folks"".

The way I understand it, Capitol Hill used to be kind of a shitty part of town that nobody respectable wanted, so all the gay folks went and lived there to get away from overt discrimination.  A community formed, and it was a place where gay folks could actually establish a reputation and identity as themselves.  Straight people were still welcome, with the tacit understanding that ""gay people are normal here, and if you're in this neighborhood, you'll respect that.""

It seems that in the last 10 years, as being gay suddenly started to become ""officially acceptable"", there were a lot more straight folks hanging out on the Hill.  For the most part, they were courteous guests and considerate neighbors, since they knew that while they could live comfortably in most parts of the city, Capitol Hill was one of the few spots gay people felt like they could live comfortably.

But it didn't really last.  The rise of Amazon brought a wave of new people into the city who were concerned most with proving how connected, hip, and ""on top"" of things they were.  Capitol Hill was perfect, because hey- hanging out with all the gays is a great way to hop on a bandwagon to prove you're worldly, forward-thinking and progressive.

There's a really good quote that I read somewhere.  Paraphrased, it's that cities and neighborhoods don't become great unless they are filled with people that love them, because only people who love where they live are willing to sacrifice for it.  Gay folks really do love Capitol Hill, and for the most part, it was gay folks that put in the blood, sweat, tears, money, and love into making it not just a neighborhood, but a community.",false,false,t1_csgr9u6,mhink,Belltown,0,1435121453,t5_2qhad,t3_3auck0,t1_csgl1u1,11,1437304491,0,0,csgr9u6,Seattle,11,,flair

I'll try to explain it in a way that even you can understand, but I don't hold out any hope.

Reserve funds can be earmarked for anything. We had a six-month operating reserve, so that if 100% of our donations dried up, we would still be able to provide services for six months while coming up with an exit plan. We had a capital reserve, where we squirreled away money to use to replace physical structures. We had an educational and direct services reserve where we kept money for client assistance. The $100,000 can be paid out of any reserve and then replenished with donations. That's how reserves work. 

Maybe they chose to not do that and instead go out into the public for a very successful fund raising campaign. But to operate with no reserves is not OK.

Zoning is so jacked that we have two kinds of players in development, large LLCs that build huge projects, mostly luxury because the ROI is better, and small general contractors who build cookie cutter townhouses.

Its why you don't see 4-12 unit apartments being built anywhere, you would go broke trying to build one. Community meetings would bleed you dry, and neighbor complaints would drag out for years. So your either a huge builder with army of lawyers, and tons of cash who can afford large projects, or you tear down a house and build six townhouses with a over the counter permit that requires no review.

There's a new city park going in (I think on/near Westlake and Lenora). If I remember right it's part of the Amazon Rufus 2.0 project, they bought the land for it in exchange for the public alley space that they are taking. 

City Light is preparing to build a new substation in Denny for the electrical needs of the new Denny triangle/SLU.

Transportation: If you're in a car, you're not going to like this, but here's what the area has going as far as transportation goes:
There are a lot of new protected bike lanes being put in as part of the Bike Master Plan (some are paid for by Amazon), more bus service in the area thanks to the recent Seattle vote to pay for Metro service and light rail will open to connect Westlake to Cap Hill and Husky Stadium in 6 or 7 months. I've also heard talk of converting some lanes in the area to be bus only to make transit better.

Schools: The City of Seattle School District has expressed its desire to buy property for a downtown Seattle Elementary School, they tried and failed to buy the old Federal Building a while back, I haven't seen any real progress here.

"It seems like this article didn't very honestly include the hard data needed to answer the questions it brought up. 

""While there were only 119 suspensions for clear-cut violations like alcohol, tobacco or drugs, schools logged a whopping 7,479 incidents for “other behavior.”""

The graphs further down give ""rates of punishment"" for various clear-cut violations but don't indicate what number of students actually engaged in them. Did equal proportions of white and black children commit theft but with unequal rates of suspension, or was one group committing theft much more frequently than another? Because of how each student was only counted once I feel the chart itself could be very misleading. 

e.g. a student commits theft twice and is suspended once. Is this counted as 100% because the student was punished and gets counted only once? If so the student group with more repeat offenders would be expected to get punished at a ""higher rate"" due to basic math. Kid A in Group 1 commits theft twice and is punished once. Kids B and C both in Group 2 commit theft once but only kid B is punished. Even though both groups are punished half the time would this chart indicate 100% vs 50%? It's even worse than that because you'd expect repeat offenders to get less leniency. 

Obviously either way the school system needs to figure out how to connect with children and help them avoid these kinds of mistakes. Without clearly understanding who is misbehaving and why we're putting ourselves at a disadvantage though. This problem may need to be addressed with teachers, or with the students themselves, or a combination of both.

You don't want to remove one of those lanes, even if it lets people sometimes sneak into the far lane without waiting in the line on Denny's curb lane.

It looks like they've actually closed the weird/unnecessary/dangerous westbound Yale lane. It's fine to close that one, although they should really make it a 3rd eastbound lane rather than block it off.

I couldn't care less about ""cutting in line"" (AKA efficient zipper merging). It's all about getting traffic off of Denny.

Denny gets backed up when the overflow from entering I-5 backs up all the way up Yale and into Denny at this intersection. The solution for this issue is to turn that block of Yale past the 24 Hour Fitness into a gigantic queue for I-5 that avoids flowing out onto Denny at all costs.

All parking on that block should be removed (during rush hour, at least). Ideally it would be 4 lanes, all westbound onto I-5. Think of it like the lines at the ferry: fit as many cars as possible into that block of Yale. Get them off Denny. Then allow a lane at a time to enter I-5 via smart per-lane lights.

I enjoy being able to understand the machine announcements instead of the driver's voice. The driver's voice comes out muffled and there's room for error (station names are really important to some people!).

&gt;longer trains

Slowly but surely. 3-car trains will be in rush hour use sometime after 2016, 3-car trains all day in 2021 and 4-car trains in 2023 (according to ST's service plans).

&gt;faster trains. make us feel like we will be tipping over/in fear for our coffee any second.

&gt;faster starting and stopping. i cant be the only one who enjoys a good old fashioned hard linear accelleration, it's easier to lean into. I don't trust the soft starts and stops, they make me feel like the train is easing me into something more sinsister

&gt;little regard for rider feelings, its a damn mass transit system not a therapist

As much as us able-bodied riders would love it, I don't think those who really benefit from transit would appreciate it. If you want jerky acceleration, you could keep using the older buses.

&gt;make the tracks rougher so that its louder so that when you talk the whole car doesnt awkwardly stare at you like youre an alien species

Derailments happen and they aren't pretty.

&gt;fire exits?????????????? sorta terrifies me the only exits are the stations. I realize that would require drilling really deep holes but goddammit have we not been drilling oil for the past 50 years just fine

The left-hand side of the tunnel in the video is the emergency escape path. There's smaller tunnels between the two bored tunnels (where the tracks are), so if a fire breaks out in one, people can escape to the other where they can be rescued by another train.

I'd be much more worried riding the Sounder train from Everett, since their tunnel under downtown Seattle is unlit, 100 years old and lacks any fire safety features. [If an oil train derails in that tunnel (which they use), the fire department would just let it burn instead of risking lives in trying to put the fire out](http://blog.seattlepi.com/seattlepolitics/2015/04/07/seattle-rail-tunnel-unsafe-for-first-responders-in-oil-train-fire/).

* Leave your neighborhood or city immediately.
- family issues out of town
- asshole moves in next door
- get a new job on the other side of town
- get to know all your favorite US cities by living in them
* no maintenance (more time)
* No upgrade costs
* No chance of major financial loss due to housing market crash if Amazon/Microsoft/Boeing relocates or there is a tech bubble burst.

Ways to afford a house on a middle-class income:

* Buy a house with your entire family (family as roommates).
* Buy a duplex and rent the other part
* Buy a house with a mother-in-law attached to rent it out.
* Buy a house with a studio over the detached garage and rent it out.
* Live outside of Seattle near the Sounder
* Learn home contracting skills and redo a house as your main hobby (instead of blowing money on festivals, beer, shows).

More creative housing options:

* Buy an RV and live outside of town.
* Buy a house in Gold Bar and a custom camping van.  Live in the van in the city during the week and spend the weekends at your home.
* Tiny houses
* Micro condos
* Trailer park
* Live far outside of town but commute at 4 am with no traffic and sleep in your parking spot from 5 am until you start work.

"The claim about availability of moderately priced units is specifically that in non-rent-controlled cities, there tend to be approximately as many available units at rents below the median as at rents above the median, while in rent-controlled markets, available units tend to be disproportionately priced above median rent, because people with low rents are less inclined to give them up. The problem here is that rents overall have gone way up; the median is higher, but that doesn't necessarily mean there are disproportionately fewer apartments available at sub-median rent.

I'm no PhD in economics, but I have trouble imagining how any of the alternatives you mentioned wouldn't share the same fundamental issues with rent control. Namely:

* Any system that mixes below-market controlled rents with market rents in the same city won't work, because the below-market properties will get filled and then everybody who's left (rich and poor) needs to fight over the market-rent properties, which are now more expensive because there are fewer of them.

* If you apply rent-control to *all* properties, then fewer properties will be made available because landlords can't make as much money.

In both these cases, there's a rather obvious solution, which is ""build more"". But I don't follow how that isn't already the obvious solution.",false,false,t1_csgfib4,notatallcorrect,,0,1435098923,t5_2qhad,t3_3aut1s,t1_csgdply,10,1437297636,0,0,csgfib4,Seattle,10,,

"$70k doesn't seem bad. Yeah its a hefty chunk of change but a house is no laughing matter when you DON'T live in the middle of nowhere. And Seattle is definitely not the middle of nowhere.

There are a shitload of companies hiring here. You don't even really have to be particularly conformist to get a job here, like in the midwest. Nobody cares what you look like as long as you're motivated and reliable. If you don't have a skillset, learn one on youtube or lynda. Pirate some office software like photoshop or excel. Look at the header photo for this sub, all those buildings are filled with companies that are hiring.

There are so many entrepreneurial people here, you don't have to work for ""the man"". The PNW is famous for its quirky little businesses. There is a store by my house in Ballard that just sells socks and shoes. It looks like its been here for ever. Theres no tech bullshit going on there. Don't want to be white collar? Get a construction or fishing job, those guys make like $60k in 6 months. I can only assume there is demand for construction and blue collar work here.

Stop buying xboxes with credit cards. Stop buying $5 coffee every day. Stop going to music festivals. Stop buying legal weed. Keep your head down and make yourself a more valuable employee. And then buy all that shit. Get better at what you're doing. Go to networking events. Fuck, just go to reddit meet ups and be outgoing. Tell people what you love to do and that you're looking for a better job.

If you're reliable and you at least TRY to be pixel perfect with your work, you'll eventually meet someone who sees your worth and will swoop you up when they decide to start their own business or leave for a better job.

"It's not about being landlord friendly...in fact, the general recommendation of economists is also unfriendly to landlords, but in a different way: increasing supply. New supply brings down rent through competition, because an empty unit makes drastically less money than a unit that is rented out at a lower-than-ideal price. 

There are plenty of mechanisms where both quantity and quality of housing are reduced through rent control, and they are quite extensively validated in empirical research. For example, quality is reduced because many landlords stop maintaining or upgrading their units. Quantity is reduced because some landlords pull their housing off the market altogether, preferring to convert to condos or demolishing for alternative uses with higher returns. Housing supply doesn't grow with growing demand because the price they can charge is lowered or limited. These aren't the only mechanisms, but they are among the most frequently mentioned in lay-literature...more exist if you want to dig deeper. 

Cato might be an incredibly biased source of information, but when you combine it with consensus from economists who have repeatedly criticized Cato, it definitely holds more weight.

 With increasing population, and increasing stratification between demographics (the haves, have nots etc) it isn't surprising that night life areas will see an increase in assault - more people generally means more crime, and when a traditionally gay neighborhood becomes the go-to place for nightlife, attracting less socially liberal people from outside of the city, then we're probably not going to see gay-bashing come to an end.

"You know, there might be a lot of decent arguments against development, but your point is completely lost when you drop to this level.  I really wish that instead of calling people names, you'd come up with a coherent argument for an alternative to the developments.  Since we're on the subject of 23rd and Union, try this one, for example:

""The mid-town center will inevitably be redeveloped.  It's an underutilized property in a neighborhood which people are just now starting to see the value of.  However, given that there are four adjacent properties which are all in some stage of development, I'd like to make the case that we wait five to ten years before breaking ground.  Sudden, simultaneous developments in close proximity drastically changes the profile of a neighborhood, often in unpredictable ways.  With nothing but brand new, highly priced commercial spaces available, I'm concerned that this intersection would be devastated in the event of an economic downturn, should one occur.""

Edit: To answer your question, as someone who has spent time in the warehouses (Fulfillment Centers) and now works in SLU, Amazon is not always the easiest company to work for. The warehouse work in the past was pretty physically demanding. I know a few years back there was a guy back east who suffered a heat stroke. Since then they have worked to make the job less taxing, and frankly with the ongoing implementation of KIVA and other robotic technology, the FC's will continue to automate and become less and less human dependent. At corporate there is a history of people getting burned out quickly. I am lucky to have an amazing team and a great manager who really understands the importance of work/life balance, but I do know that some folks have a horrible time. Long story short, the warehouse work is not fun, but it pays ok (entry level pay starts at like $13 an hour in the Seattle area, with full benefits).

"One of the ways to mitigate the issue is to make prices based on what you can afford and not an absolute value. This is more appropriate to the rental market but if a certain percentage of houses are sold based on the income of the buyer, say 40%, then plenty of people will be able to afford to live in homes. I'm still working out the details of this plan, like making sure that you can't flip the house and so on, but with the proper rules in place people will just get to live in their own home as they should.

Like someone else said, that would be 30,000 people per day, every single day, including that Wednesday in November when it's pouring down rain and 45 degrees out, or that Monday in January when it's below freezing all day. I bet very little research was put into making this number accurate. Even if there was some effort put into this number, I bet they're counting local repeat visitors, like the hundreds of office workers that likely go there multiple times a week for lunch.

I'll never forget the blissful amazement when I first downloaded a song off Napster instead of either going to the mall or camping around the radio ready to hit record on my tape player. 

I hated when the song I waited an a couple hours for finally came on and the DJ, who had been silent for the previous 12 songs, decides to give 20 seconds of commentary over the intro. It took true dedication to capture the music you loved and you accepted DJ intros as a price to actually have your music on demand. Napster is the closest example we can relate to the concept of Heaven on Earth. It was completely mind-blowing.

It's ironic how now I miss those intros. I listened so much to my bootleg tapes it is ingrained in my music memory. I wish I still had those tapes.

Why do we waste taxpayer money on hetero stuff like tax credits for married joint-filers and children?

Why did it take 50-100 years to recognize people like Alan Turing, the inventor of modern computing, who was chemically castrated, jailed and then driven to suicide by the UK government that he pretty much saved by breaking the German's Enigma Code? We'd probably be speaking German right now if it wasn't for him.

Why are we treating human beings like second class citizens because of their sexual orientation?

The point of the rainbow/pride crosswalks it to recognize Pike/Pine as being the way it is today and for the last 30-40 years - a cultural hotspot full of art, music and amazing food - specifically because it became a gay-friendly neighborhood.

If for whatever reason, your account isn't charged and you get mailed a bill, you have 15 days to pay it. If not paid within that time, you get a $5 fee tacked on to the original charge. After that, you have you 80 days to pay the toll, or you get assessed a $40 civil penalty (not a moving violation, similar to a parking ticket) added to EACH crossing. So if you cross twice in a day, that would be the original crossing fee, + 2 late charges of $5, plus two Civil Penalties at $40 and you're now in for $90+. If that Civil Penalty is not paid, and you have 2 or more on your registration, they can then withhold renewal of the registration and tabs until paid in full.

"Oh that helps explain the difference a bit. Let me try and wrap my head around the actual numbers here. Redfin says for every 10,000 Bay Area residents looking at Redfin listings, 7,580 are looking at listings within the Bay Area while the remaining 2,420 are looking elsewhere. 

700 out of every 10,000 are looking in the Sacramento market, with 252 (.104 x 2,420) out of every 10,000 are looking within Sacramento city limits. 

520 out of every 10,000 are looking in the Southern California market, with 232 (.096 x 2,420) out of every 10,000 are looking within Los Angeles city limits, and 102 (.042 x 2,420) out of every 10,000 are looking within San Diego city limits.

510 out of every 10,000 are looking in the Seattle area, with 300 (.124 x 2,420) looking within Seattle City Limits and 210 out of every 10,000 looking at Seattle suburbs. He then digs deeper saying 65 are looking at West Seattle, 41 are looking at Queen Anne, 28 are looking at Ballard, 22 are looking at Capitol Hill, and 16 are looking at Magnolia. 

So, 3% of Bay Area residents that are shopping for homes are considering the City of Seattle? That doesn't really look like that many when you think of it that way. That counting everyone looking at listings. How many of that 3% will end up actually buying something in Seattle?

I wish people would be more consistent about using common denominators when throwing percentages around so these percentages could actually be compared among each other. Or at least be more clear about what those denominators are.

"I feel like the article skipped over a major point - the ever-increasing price of rent.  I moved to the eastside in 2009; between then and 2014, the average rent in the greater Redmond/Bellevue area for a 2 bedroom went up more than 50% (and while I don't have as much data, I'm sure the price of 1br/studios/etc. went up right along with it).  When the median selling price keeps going [up](http://blog.seattlepi.com/seattlerealestate/2013/11/07/king-county-median-home-price-rising/) and [up](http://www.zillow.com/king-county-wa/home-values/) and [up](http://www.seattletimes.com/business/real-estate/king-county-home-prices-surge-just-shy-of-2007-peak/), how in the world is it possible to save up a six figure down payment (plus a safety net) while paying off student loans and paying rent that increases more than my salary every year?

Yes, there are alternative loans like FHA and whatnot, but thanks to our competitive multi-offer homebuying environment, a seller will almost always pick an offer that's ""safe"" (all-cash or at least 20% cash) over one where there's more chance of the loan becoming a complication.  I don't know how people do it.

I got lucky - I graduated without student loans thanks to scholarship packages, I paid only 10% down, and I put in my offer around a holiday break when less people were around and looking, so I managed to avoid a bidding war.  It still took basically every penny I had to get a 1500 ft^2 house with a plot of land that basically amounts to the walls of my house plus 3 feet on each side, and that's with a 40 minute commute from work and further from westside if I ever change jobs to there.",false,false,t1_crylf5m,HenryJonesJunior,Woodinville,0,1433700229,t5_2qhad,t3_38wpd2,t3_38wpd2,34,1436799437,0,0,crylf5m,Seattle,34,,flair

"So did Wyden (D-OR), one of the big non-Rand-Paul opponents to the NSA's activities.  This version also moves the data out of the NSA's hands--so their analysts can't do things like LOVEINT--and requires the (admittedly feeble but, still...) authorization of the FISA court.  The FISA court itself gets a little bit of an overhaul, requiring that any order from it include minimization requirements and that an agency requesting records through it must detail how those requirements will be met.

Among other tidbits that are useful: requires the DoJ's Inspector General to audit and make a public report on the uses and misuses of records collected from 2012 through 2014; specifically removes the production of actual content from the purview of this law; removes the ""blanket pen register"" authority that the FISA court previously had (note: Washington State already did this for state and local law enforcement, and requires a warrant for the Stingray form of pen register traps); ancillary information gathered through a warrant or order that is later overturned is limited; and, the big one for opening the door to influence by our civil liberties groups (ACLU, EFF, EPIC, and so on): puts a procedure in place where the FISA court can accept amicus curiae submissions from unrelated but interested parties and requires the Director of National Intelligence to at least do a classification review of any ""novel or significant"" decisions of law made in the FISA court, even if no party requests it.

More reporting and open government rules now apply to both the FISA court and to requests made of it, though they first have to go through Congress or a declassification review which isn't so great.  (Oh, and someone who is the target of a nondisclosure order now has the explicit right to report on the number of those orders received in a given time period, like Microsoft, Google, and Amazon have been doing.)

9. Driving while texting... first offense is license suspension for a month, second offense is permanent license revocation.
10. If somebody is doing something blatantly illegal while driving, and you have a dash cam that shows it, you are allowed to cause a small accident, and the other driver will be at fault if the dash video corroborates your story. If the other driver speeds off because they know this, that's a lifetime driving suspension without appeal. 
11. Actually enforce the window tinting laws. The number of cars with windshields so dark you can't see into it is ridiculous. 
12. Parking lots that have ""compact"" spaces are obliged to enforce it. If there's a Suburban in a compact spot, the lot owner must have it towed.
13. Dog parks everywhere!
14. Legalize, regulate, and oversee sex workers. 
15. Provide some sense of equality to distribution of city resources based on tax intake. It's ridiculous to spend so much on cap hill and u district, while others languish for years without so much as a pothole fix. 
16. Cyclists are obligated to use cycling lanes where available. 
17. Cyclists cannot white-line if there is no cycling lane. They must maintain order.
18. Cyclists must be licensed and insured to ride on roads, with a visible license plate.
19. Cyclists must yield if they are breaking the 5-car law
20. Tolls for driving into the city. Free for people who live in the city limits, but costs money for non-residents. Non-residents entering via mass transit get in free.
21. Municipal gigabit broadband. The last neighborhoods to be served are Cap Hill, Beacon Hill, Rainier anything, etc. Those neighborhoods always get the cool stuff first. 
22. No personal pickup trucks allowed to park on city streets. Work trucks, ok. Really, any car that blocks visibility when trying to turn on our crazy narrow streets. 
23. Illegal to add a ""fair pay"" fee to restaurant bills. Raise your price or STFU. You don't want to hear my politics, and I don't want to hear your whiny-ass opinion.
24. Remove all restrictions on uber/lyft/etc as long as there are background checks and vehicle safety checks. In addition, do away with the taxi medallion system, and let it be a free-for-all. Lower the mandatory drop &amp; mileage rates to averages for cities our size. 
25. Stop allowing citizens to hold up projects based on NIMBY complaints. Stuff like ""oh it might increase crime"" or ""parking is already so bad..."" are dismissed out-of-hand. 
26. Cruise ship passengers in Interbay are to be transported by the cruise company to their location by bus. No more cabs lining up, and absolutely no more lining up to take the city buses, at least during rush hours. This is why Friday traffic sucks so bad on 15th. 
27. Cops patrolling carpools during rush hour every day. Second offense is permanent license revoking.

Sorry if I phrased my comment poorly, I should have said ""maybe you know me as the homeless Real Change vendor redditor that frequently comments and posts in this sub"".

Oh, and just in case you were unaware, not all RC vendors are homeless. Many have apartments in public assisted housing. I just happen to live in an alley doorway, which is quite different than most.

EDIT: I wanted to clarify regarding RC vendors that many are housed through DSHS, DESC, or HEN, and several are disabled or mentally ill, so they cannot work.

This has happened a number of times now. In your video, there are a couple of shops off to the right.

About 30 seconds later the owner of the car came out of the shop and moved his car. He's lucky, because I'd also already called parking enforcement. (I call for everyone that does this now.)

I previously tweeted @dongho_chang (SDOT traffic engineer) asking for bollards. He said they were coming, then the next day construction cones appeared where the bollards should be (between the parking lane and the cycle track). Then about 2 days later the cones were gone. I tweeted again but I got no response.

So, supposedly there will be bollards there in the future. Mr. Chang also mentioned there would be a bike-specific signal for the cycle track crossing Mercer St (beginning of your video), which should prevent those pesky potential right hooks from the drivers who've been ignoring both ""no right turn"" signs.

"I totally get that. It's pay up or gtfo. Seattle owes nobody anything. But, the problem with Seattle, for the working class, at least, is that technology companies like Amazon and others have rapidly created a new market for housing that is pushing out the garbage collector, the mechanic, the electrician, the bus driver, etc. Their wages will not likely respond fast enough to keep pace with this new market, yet the city absolutely needs these people in order to function. Sure, there's always Renton, Kent, and Tacoma to provide these kinds of folks with a place to live, but then the commute and traffic issues come into play. As the working class get pushed out and are forced to commute longer distances on increasingly crowded roads and freeways, the traffic gets even worse, and the need for expanded transit increases.

Although a few restaurants (like Ivars Salmon House) have skipped the phasing in and jumped straight to $15 / hour for their employees and eliminated tips - these places will likely have signs indicating that.

Personally if someone is making a living wage (and a lot are not right now) then I'm going to tip on the service I receive, that could be 20% it could be less than that, good servers deserve good tips. If they're just OK then give them an OK tip (10% maybe??), if they're shitty don't feel bad about giving them nothing. It's good that Seattle is starting to get out of this weird social convention that tipping has become in the US. Tipping by definition is for those that go above and beyond, it shouldn't be the standard.

"So the minimum wage still has another 36% to go to get to $15 ( 4/11 = .36)?  And predictions are being made already?  Someone is jumping the gun a bit early.

FWIW, some effects will be hard to determine, especially since its hard to prove a negative.  It would be tough to define, exactly, how many jobs don't materialize due to higher wages as opposed to tracking layoffs or reduced hours for jobs that already exist.

My take on this is that once you raise the bottom level, I don't see how that CANNOT have a ripple effect on wages that are already at $15 an hour that require some education and training.  If I had a job that required 2 years of community college or vocational school that paid $15 an hour I'd be campaigning for a raise, as this effectively demotes everyone at that wage that obtained specialized skills.  Companies that hire such workers will have to raise their wages, the $16 an hour employers will have to follow suit, then the $17 an hour workers will want more and so on...

The bottom is the bottom no matter what number is attached to it.  And the bottom will always be struggling.

Public shaming isnt a new form of discipline, it's upvoted on reddit all the time and people praise them for their bold parenting. I guess now we know what could happen if we gamble with it. We are absolutely devastated by what is happening to such an amazing family. The mother was a big part of the beginning of my marriage because I looked to their relationship as something to strive for. She was someone I reached out to as a new parent because they were so great with their kids, and their kids adored them. I'm not excusing the dad for what he did. We all know it was wrong. I will say that in their culture, cutting hair as punishment is more common than you'd think. No one does something like this and thinks it'll affect their child in such a way. No one does this thinking it will do anything but teach their kid a lesson. 

It's easy to read the article and assume that he's an abusive bastard who should be in jail. I know, very well, how hard it is to sympathize with him in this situation. He will wrestle these demons forever. He's a good man. She's a good mother. And izabela was a lovely little girl who deserved a long and happy life. It's such a horrific situation where everyone lost so much. I know the parents will hold steady and stay strong for their remaining children, because that's truly what they live for. I just hope we can let them grieve in peace and let the proper people handle the situation if there's laws that he has to answer for, instead of smearing a young girls name all over the internet to the point where she's only remembered for her death.

They're going through the darkest time of their lives and it has to happen in the public eye because of the combination of events that lead us here. Izabel was bullied at school. She felt bullied at home. This was the only thing she thought would make her pain go away. It is so sad. Thousands of people are filled with sadness for her. I don't want to take away from her death, and I apologize if that sounds like what I am doing. I just want everyone to know the truth. Every member of this family is devoted to each other.

"They have something like this on the Centennial Trail that runs north from Snohomish, though much less visible than this example.  Honestly, asking pedestrians(with or without their dogs), long boarders, roller bladers and of course cyclists to navigate something like this would be terrible.  Not only would it be a bottle neck, but people would focus more on navigating through the chicane than crossing traffic. 

I really like the flashing stop signs and raised crosswalks they have put around U Village.  The Interurban trail also has stop lights that have specific triggers for cyclists where it crosses 145th and 130th and the light at 85 is triggered by my bike as well.  IMO a much better system than having to dismount and go press a walk signal.

"I played baseball for Mercer Island back in high school. The juniors and seniors on this team are my old teammates and I was actually present at this game in the stands, so I should probably point out that I'm personally invested in this game.

Frankly, they dun goofed.

There were four different reasons why this play rightfully ended with an out and without a run, although funnily enough, the article gets the reasons wrong. 

Firstly, Brandon Lawler, who should have been going from second to third never made it there. That's an out for abandoning your assigned base, and ended up being the out the umpires actually utilized.

Secondly, Anthony Scalzo, the batter, threw his bat. That's an automatic out.

Thirdly, he took off his helmet. Another automatic out. Both of these are for safety reasons.

Fourthly, he was touched by his teammates when they mobbed him. This one is a little more ambiguous and depends on umpire discretion as the out would be for improperly assisting the runner.

But Scalzo was never called out for failing to reach first base, because he did eventually get there after a short detour. On a walk, basepath rules do not apply. It doesn't matter how you get to your assigned base, as long as you eventually get there.

A little excerpt from the site about the parade:


""Today, the parade has been made famous (infamous!) by the inclusion of the Solstice Cyclists (Solstice Cylists.org), a celebration of 1500+ naked-but-painted bike riders, who are released onto the parade route before the start of the Solstice Parade.  This event celebrates the rebel in all of us!  It is a “nude not lewd” event, where families are welcome to watch their friends bare all, paint up, and ride through the streets of Fremont!""

"Ah, Stampede Pass. My old stomping grounds. I spent a LOT of time up there as a teenager. Here's some fun facts: 

* Northern Pacific Railroad (""NP"") ran their transcontinental line from Minnesota to Yakima to Tacoma through Lester and the Green River watershed. That's where Tacoma gets its water. Instead of having holding tanks for the toilets in the railcars, the poo just dropped onto the tracks. Tacoma wasn't thrilled about poo going in their water. After extensive negotiation and pressure from Tacoma civic leaders it was agreed that the doors to the train bathrooms would be locked as the NP trains passed through the Lester area. 


* In the late 20th century, the rail line was abandoned. It cannot handle double stack containers through the single-decker hand-bricked 1900s tunnel, so the railroad determined it wasn't economically viable and shut 'er down. A bunch of mountain biking guidebooks got published that said ""Hey, the tracks are abandoned on Stampede Pass. Grab your mountain bike and ride on through!"" Then economic conditions changed and the railroad reopened the line. This was the early/mid 1990s, Google wasn't really a thing. People got their information from books. And there were a lot of books out there saying it was safe to bike through when it wasn't. 

* It's called Stampede Pass because legend had it that when they blew the whistle on payday, you could hear the stampede of rail construction workers getting the hell out of there to go drink and screw their paycheck away. 

* Before they built the tunnel, they had a rail line that did switchbacks up the top of the mountain. If you hike around you can still find those switchbacks. 

* As a sexually confused angsty teenager with 4-wheel drive and more gasoline than common sense, I spent a LOT of time up there doing things you couldn't get away with in the city. 

* Based on years of hanging out there, I thoroughly believe the area to be, in scientific terms, ""haunted as shit."" ",false,false,t1_csj2x00,soundslikepuget,Marine Area 7,0,1435292361,t5_2qhad,t3_3b4zn3,t3_3b4zn3,54,1437359395,0,0,csj2x00,Seattle,54,,flair

"&gt; You can't let one scumbag 

In my military career we were taught that you can and will let one scumbag ruin everything because that's all it takes. The police need to police themselves to cut off the spoiled fruit or it taints them all. Not only is it to appeal to the masses, but it's a self respect issue. 

Think about this. You're working in a company, you follow all the rules, show up early and leave late, but fucking Jerry (or is it Larry or Gerry or something like that?) is always late, takes an extra 15 minutes for lunch, and is always getting ready to go home before anyone else. 

First he's siphoning money from the business by not doing his job. Second, he's making others start to do the same thing. 

You now have a few obvious options. 1) you mind your own business and work hard and hope someone notices and reprimands him or gives you a raise. 2) tell him or management you're sick of his shit because you do what's right and he doesn't but neither is acknowledged, but then you're worried you'll ruffle feathers and look like the bad guy. 3) if you can't beat 'em, join 'em. 

So generally everything falls apart. No one speaks up, the hardworkers go unnoticed and often end up getting tired and joining the bad side of things, and those breaking the rules keep pushing the boundaries, which makes it all spiral out of control. 

It's entropy at work, and we are social animals so we're really good at turning into packs of idiots without a strong sense of direction.

Fiber is frequently billed as gigabit, but you're right, nobody needs that much bandwidth... now. (15 years ago, people could get by with a 56k modem for their Internet needs. Try that now.) But having a complete fiber infrastructure allows for more _consistent_ fast connections. Instead of getting 12Mbit, maybe being reduced to 3-5 during peak hours, you can get a solid, consistent 25, 50, or 100Mbit up/down, without having to deal with big telecom service and overselling.

"&gt;This isn't the first time he's done this.

There are plenty of shady developers who operate under the adage that it's easier to ask for forgiveness than permission.  
Unfortunately they get away with it often enough to make the practice profitable.  I know because I've met several of their ilk.

One of these shady builders used to brag that he was an expert and breaking covenants.  He'd buy a lot in a housing development that didn't have and HOA, but had covenants governing the size, placement and overall 'look' of the house - a legally binding agreement signed at the time he purchased the properties, which he would immediately break.  He retained a pretty competent ambulance chaser to cow anyone who challenged him with costly litigation.  

It worked out well for him until one community called bullshit and dragged him into court. It cost the community some money, every household had to pony up a decent chunk of cash, but they knew if they didn't fight the guy they'd never be able to enforce their covenants in the future.  The shady builder lost his shirt and went bankrupt.  Bummer for him.

&gt; If he doesn't have to tear it down, it just tells developers they can go forward and face minor fines. 

I agree.  I think the city should give no leeway and order the developer to demolish the structure within 30 days.  Send in Habitat For Humanity to salvage what they can and bulldoze whatever's left if he fails to comply.  Afterwards he can apply for the permits to construct his monstrosity, build the garage he has the permit to construct, or...

Make him pay.  This guy knew what he did was wrong and he did it anyway.  Send a clear signal that you can't pull this nonsense in Seattle.  While they're at it, the city ought to pay more attention to what's going on.

"Yeah, it's OK to connect neighborhoods with exclusive lane trollies, but not if it's in Rainier Valley? That's what the light rail is down there. And are't ""the capillaries"" he talks about just our current bus service, which is a fine inner neighborhood transit system but fails in the commute clogged arterials to downtown? 

And people in Rainier Valley shouldn't be able to commute to downtown efficiently? I thought our lack of commuter transit to the suburbs was one of the issues of gentrification in the core. As people are forced further out, they are subject to long car commutes, therefore the cost of sprawl is unfairly exported to the poor. Kinda like how 3rd world nations are facing the majority of climate change costs, but it was the first world nations who where responsible for the damage in the first place.

Also, isn't skipping infrastructure improvements for neighborhoods with minority majority demographics really fucking racist? Sorry Harlem, you don't get subways stops, libraries, parks, bike lanes, fire stations or other public infrastructure. Any improvement to the condition of your public life will just fuck you over in the end, so give up.

"Floating the Snoqualmie from the Falls to Fall City is done by tens of thousands of people every summer. Fall City isn't a city and doesn't have a local government or much infrastructure for visitors. A lot of volunteer time and money has been spent by residents to cope. Efforts are underway to get more county and state involvement. This costs taxpayers more money and, I predict, will result in more presence by law enforcement. In order to keep things cheaper and cooler, make an effort to be cool yourself.

The best parking is on the side of the river across from the Fall City business district. Upstream from the business district, and on the same side of the river, is a launch ramp and a parking lot. The road to the campground leads to the launch ramp. It isn't good to park in a business's lot if you aren't shopping there. Don't get creative about parking spots, thousands before you have done the same thing. Stay legal and respectful.

There is a somewhat new parking lot and boat ramp at the power station below the Falls that is an alternative to the more usual down river (Plum River access) put in.

Take all your trash home with you. The trash stations have been built and are maintained by volunteers. It's easy to put a trash bag in your cooler. Maybe pick up somebody else's empties too. Don't take glass bottles on the river. They break and get stepped on.

It doesn't happen often, but people do drown in the Snoqualmie. The shock of cold water can incapacitate someone who could otherwise swim. Alcohol doesn't help with judgement or swimming ability. Consider having your drink after the float. Whether a Personal Flotation Device is legally required depends on your attitude and the officer's and the definition of a vessel. A PFD can cover up your beer belly and reduce sunburn. Go ahead and be different. If you are in a group, increase your safety by using a buddy system. Always keep track of your buddy when going in and out of the water.

Drowning people don't flail about and make noise. They silently sink.

There is more information about floating the Snoqualmie at : floatsnoqualmie.com

If you are a frequent visitor, or planning an event with a group, consider contacting the The Fall City Community Association. You could volunteer for river cleanup or maybe make a donation to offset porta-potty, and other, costs. (I am not a member of the Association and do not speak for them.)

There is a new company starting this season to serve people on the river with tubes and shuttles and other services. Look them up if you are interested. I have had no association with them so this is not intended as a recommendation.

"Broadband access should be viewed as a utility and everyone, by virtue of being a resident of Seattle should have quality access.

Looking at the operating expense estimates of the [broadband report](http://www.seattle.gov/broadband/broadband-study) it looks like the 500 - 700 million price tag being cited by reporters appears to be over a *20 year* time horizon. If anyone knows better, please correct me.

The aggregate operating costs per *year* however, were between 30 and 38 million (the 38 million being 20 years from now - inflation).

This got me to thinking, what are the yearly costs of other things that I like and support and how expensive is broadband by comparison?

* Propsition 1 to restore Metro bus service: [$45 million per year](http://murray.seattle.gov/metro/)
* Libraries: [$65 million for 2015](http://www.spl.org/about-the-library/budget)
* Murray's upcoming Move Seattle levy: [$95 million per year - PDF](http://www.seattle.gov/transportation/docs/LevyProposalBrochure.pdf)

By comparison, broadband seems cheap. To me this begs the question, why wouldn't we fund it like we do these other services? The city's CTO was right, if Seattle builds a municipal network, Comcast/CenturyLink will try to kill it and undercut the price. 

So here's my thought experiment I'd like you guys to consider and debate. What if we funded broadband 100% through property or other taxes and the end user didn't have to pay out of pocket at all? Or what if everyone was guaranteed some minimum level of service and subscribers could opt to pay more to increase bandwidth above that minimum?

I am paying $700/year for [technically not-broadband](https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-finds-us-broadband-deployment-not-keeping-pace) 12/0.75 Mbps service from CenturyLink.

"More affordable housing is good. But if the affordable housing comes at the cost of building other housing, the net effect will be negative. Building 10 units of affordable housing does jack all if rent prices keep going up and 100 low income units are lost elsewhere because of that.

You can build all the affordable housing you want, it won't be a drop in the bucket. I think (take with a grain of salt) the only long term solution is to build absolutely as much as possible of any kind of housing.

There's some data missing here - namely direct comparisons to big agribusiness organic producers. Demand for organic is so high, and there's so much of it on the shelves, that to produce it at the quantities available now its not at all a small farms momandpop kind of operation. So, while a small farm that sells locally to wealthy buyers may be able to exist in a very sustainable, low impact manner I have my doubts that big organic producers - especially those outside the US - are much different than your conventional producers. Organic farmers still use pesticide, still use up land, still plant large monocrops (these are all necessary for large scale production, but they are also criticisms of conventional farming).

"Huh.  Maybe you should have posted this love letter to NYC in the NYC subreddit.  Because it sounds like you just wanted to complain about the ways in which Seattle isn't NYC.  You're right. We aren't.

Here's the thing about Seattle (and any new place, person, culture, etc.): you have to actually try to understand what it is to appreciate it, not fixate on what it isn't.

The most important thing to know about Seattle is that it has more transplants than natives &amp; has since 1992.  This means that many people come here feeling out of place &amp; continue to feel that way because they can't ""settle in"". There isn't a lot to settle in to.  To make the best of Seattle right now, you have to be willing to create your own community. And with the huge number of transplants/outsiders you can probably find a way to create a community that you would love to hang with.  

Native Seattleites don't wear their political opinions on their sleeves, but that doesn't mean they don't have them. They talk about them with people they trust.  And trust is earned here, typically by showing that you can be respectful/non-judgmental of a persons right to have their own opinion or way of living.  i.e. If you made fun of someone wearing a live cobra on their head, you'd lose trust.  

Don't judge Seahawks fever by last year. Seattleites are notorious for only paying attention to the sports teams when they're doing well. Except the Sounders, they seem to get love no matter what, but the fans seem to like being covert so it won't be in your face.

And, yes, a double show by The Pope and Elvis would totally bomb here.  Very few people care about either one, let alone both of them.  Now, if it were Macklemore and Neil deGrasse Tyson, we'd have a different story.

But, life is too short to live someplace you don't enjoy. If you dislike it, you should go back to NYC. Be happy with your home.  (This is an example of Seattleite emotional interaction.  Internally, I'm really offended by your rant about Seattle. I love this place &amp; hate when people bash it.  But just because I love it doesn't mean everyone will.  Rather than tell you to fuck off and get out of my city, which would be emotional diarrhea, I'm going to try to see it from your perspective and empower you to make the best choice for yourself.)",false,false,t1_cs2dqvk,crumpledlife,,0,1433978345,t5_2qhad,t3_39cvct,t3_39cvct,14,1436891792,0,0,cs2dqvk,Seattle,14,,

So what happens is you'll call up and convert your account to autopay using a rfid sticker, and then you'll pay off all of your outstanding balance at the same time, seems fine right? Well, there could still be additional tolls ""in flight"" that haven't yet shown up in the system, because apparently it was built using hand cranked machinery at some point in the 19th century. So those unpaid tolls hit and the system goes ""huh, well, we have these tolls for this plate, and we have this auto-pay method registered for a sticker that has the same plate, well, WHO KNOWS WHAT TO DO?! best to just not do anything."" So they get mailed to you, which you may or may not even receive, and you are likely to ignore because you have everything on autopay right?

We aren't at $15 an hour yet. If you work for a big business (basically over 500 employees), you will make $13 an hour next January and $15 an hour in January 2017.

If the company pays for your health insurance, they have one extra year to get to $15 an hour — that will be Jan 2018.

For small businesses (under 500 employees), the minimum wage rises more slowly and hits $15 an hour by 2021. That’s in six years.

Was it those rants about comic book character as sterotype of person in the stranger, or the rants out of the seattle times that might as well have been cleveland?  Was it all the women who came from all over, and decided they're interesting because they live in a certain area, are still sort of (sort of) young, and got a hot dude to fuck them once?  Yep, they're inspiring beyond belief.

This is where culture, dreams, and fun go to die.

Let's all get a beer and talk about how interesting we are, how much more together, intelligent, cool, collected, and with it we are, while sillicon valley tears us up, and real cities with real cultures laugh at our provincialism and xenophobia. Let's pretend there is just one culture, upper-middle class WASP culture, that is, and let's emulate a TV show. Let's exclude each other based on split-second assumptions, then wonder why we only like it here because of the paycheck and a bunch of people building up this idea that doesn't really exist. But hey, we'll have a single spine of mass transit in like three decades, so that's something. And this homeless thing will just fix itself, because we understand this problem and are totally willing to tackle it.

It was built as a bunkhouse for railroad workers, but it's been turned into a really cozy small hotel with a railroad theme.  It's a whistle stop for Amtrak--they literally deposit you at the end of the Inn's front walk, where the staff meets you with a luggage wagon.

"We cannot maintain USCG ice breakers, ships designed and purposed built, to operate in these waters. Even these ships, which are really good... The Polar Sea and the Polar Star are old relics built largely in response to the cold war.. and there is little funding support for new vessels. The Polar Sea was deactivated, and probably cannibalized to keep the sister ship, the Polar Star going.

We have submarines, designed for warfare with the Russians, that are capable of operating year round. The issue with detecting the source of a leak is that these were not built to have windows and look at water quality. They can't always surface due to the ice conditions either.

The ice floes will mask the surface expression of an oil leak or seap. We have no known way of detecting an oil leak under ice floes. People are hypothesizing (I was present at a talk) that there are acoustic techniques to try and scan for oil spills masked by ice. Completely new idea, trying to get ahead of the problem.

 Logically, a leak response would be retrofit onto a warfare sub and try to scan for the leak source. We, in the United States, have never done anything like this before. The closest is say the Kursk or one in the 60s. It could take a years to figure out how to locate and access a site safely with the seasonal conditions.

Now contrast this with Deepwater, which was a spill cleanup mitigated by thousands of people, easy helicopter access, and people caught on that there was a problem right away (from small planes, which the Arctic seas have few to none). It still took them like 18 months, and the warm water and lack of storms allowed for easy manoeuvres and fast acting biological activity.
