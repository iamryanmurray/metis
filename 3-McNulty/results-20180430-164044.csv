"So, I know it is fun to bash cops and shit, but here is the deal with the number of shots fired by police.

Most police are normal human beings, their level of training is not all that much higher than normal people. They are not soldiers (despite how much Reddit loves to talk about the militarization of police) who are trained to kill. They are law enforcement officers trained to do an entirely different job, and SOMETIMES that involves the use of lethal force.

The thing to remember about normal human beings is that they tend to not like to kill each other. Killing each other is usually bad for a species and so over the tens of thousands of years of being human and the millions of years of being primates we pretty much developed a very very strong urge to NOT kill each other. Despite that we figured out along the way that as an intelligent beast we sometimes do need to kill each other, and yes it sucks, and when we have to do it we have to fight against our natural urges to do so. Killing isn't easy.

Guess how many people actively shot at the enemy in WW2? Take a wild one? These were all trained soldiers. Less than 10%. The number of people who actually fired their weapons was slightly higher, but those people shot above their targets or intentionally missed. This is a war that killed tens and tens of millions of people and only 10% did the shooting, heck of that 10% they were accountable for less than 40% of the actual casualties. Artillery fire killed or injured 60% of combatants in WW2, a form of combat that is very easy since the killing is so detached. The rest was made up for by bombings, other forms of combat, including small arms fire.

So what does this say about cops? Well cops are not soldiers. They don't even have the training of a WW2 soldier, who barely fired his weapon at the target and if they did was more likely to miss on purpose (subconsciously though most of the time). This is the same thing that happens with cops. They don't want to kill people (seriously, they don't, only 2% of the population are actual psychotics who can act with out empathy) and they do not have the training to turn that part of their brain off in that situation like modern soldiers do.

This is a good thing. A cop needs to exercise discretion when using lethal force. Sometimes they over react, again, not having that drill level of training is a double edged sword, you don't know how everyone is going to react in a situation that potentially involves mortal combat. Cops are not regimented like soldiers, they go home at night, have family issues, and come to work the next day, it is not as controlled an environment as a military. Most of the time cops do make the right decision, sometimes they do not.

So when you hear about so many rounds being fired at a suspect by police it is most likely not because they are poor shots, but because no one there actually wanted to shoot the person in the first place, but felt they still needed to fire their weapon.

For more information you should check out *On Killing* by former Lt. Col. Dave Grossman.

"&gt;If non-transit riders and transit riders alike benefit from transit, I'm having trouble understanding why there should be less of it.

I'm not saying to eliminate transit. Some transit is good, but too much to the point where it's hemorrhaging millions of dollars per year and constantly needing to be propped up by people who don't use its service isn't justifiable to me. Even though this would disproportionally affect me negatively, I'm taking a principled stand here because I don't think that others who don't use Metro should have to subsidize me.

&gt;There's no such thing as a perfectly efficient system. While I do support accountability, I don't think it's wise to cut funding from programs that benefit citizens in an effort to make them more efficient.

How do you support accountability then? Who would be held accountable and how if we continue to underwrite this horrible business model?

&gt;Personally, I think that public schools are horribly inefficient.

Agreed. Every part of the government is horribly inefficient. I do support reducing school funding though. Mostly I mean that to imply that all the money that gets wasted funneling it through Washington DC should be eliminated and the federal government should get out of the education business (and left to parents and local government maybe), but in general I think schools get plenty of money. Spending has gone way up adjusting for inflation in the last 30-40 years and we've seen nothing in the way of increased test scores. It's stagnant. That's not a great return on investment.

&gt;Given your concerns about wasting taxpayer money I wonder what your feelings are about military spending- do you think it should be drastically cut to reduce wasted money?

Absolutely. I think it should be scaled back to a national defense, not offense. The less government the better in my book. I'm Libertarian if you couldn't tell already.

"I'm not sure what was unclear.

- You: ""I'm not convinced... that the terribleness that is 4th ave traffic can withstand an additional lane cut.""

- I pointed out that Biden's motorcade closed 4th through downtown for evening commute, and we did not see significant increases in delay on parallel arterials.

Like most one way urban arterials, the size of the arterial is likely *causing* the traffic. Also, can you cite 2nd ""not being like"" 4th now? I think evening peak traffic may be worse on 2nd than 4th. SDOT produces volume and delay data annually, so you should be able to find this pretty easily and find out if your assertion is right.

Adding bike share increases bicycle safety by putting more riders on the road - this is well documented over and over and over again, regardless of infrastructure. It's the same reason we're working on getting rid of our helmet law (or making it a secondary offense) - the outcome of the additional riders that come from more casual use increases safety more than the outcome of the helmets.

My transit 'idealism' is one thing - me championing things that other cities have done in similar situations. I have never suggested an idea that hasn't been tested somewhere else.

Nobody came forth (but thank you so much for asking!), so I'm probably going to have to take it in and cover it ""for now"".  I am definitely going to take your advice and push the insurance company to investigate--it's not an inexpensive car, so chances are its going to be a good deal of money for them, too.

"&gt; Regardless, the law doesn't include businesses with less than 25 people, so your point is pretty moot.

From my original reply:

&gt; Assuming the bill even has a limit as to which employers would be affected by this, what about those on the ass-end of the margin? Fuck them and their employees?

If you're barely keeping your business afloat and have 24 employees, hiring one more employee is a *huge* barrier. If that pushes your business over the edge into bankruptcy, your employees will have to find new jobs. Based on the latest BLS info, 10 of them will be unemployed for more than 6 months collecting benefits that have to be paid for by everyone still working.

Crossing that threshold, an employee who's been with the company for 5 years will cost the business a minimum of 120 hours x $wage *more* each year.. With a $15/hr minimum wage (also in place in this state) that's $1800/yr or $150/mo *each*.

Taking a conservative estimate of 5 long-term employees that's $750/mo. If the rest of the employees are eligible at the minimum requirement, those will now cost $600/yr more *each*.

Add it all up and that's $13,800/yr our example business would be saddled with - just for mandatory vacation.

What's more likely to happen is we'll see a proliferation of 24-employee businesses that look for every way they can to avoid hiring that 25th Once you start tearing into the details, it's no wonder Big Business is beating out the little guy.

Edit: Oh, and one more - If you're a marginal company with 25-30 employees today, you're staring down the barrel of a new $15,000 bill this year. If you can't pay it and want your business to survive, you're going to fire the least productive people on your staff until you're under 25.",false,true,t1_cezgysz,JeffreyRodriguez,Bainbridge Island,0,1390768263,t5_2qhad,t3_1w59ta,t1_cezg6vs,3,1432117658,0,0,cezgysz,Seattle,3,,flair,

&gt;

&gt;[UNESCO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO)'s __City of Literature__ program is part of its [Creative Cities Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Cities_Network) which was launched in 2004.  The Network was born out of UNESCO's Global Alliance for Cultural Diversity initiative which was created in 2002. Its aim is to ""promote the social, economic and cultural development of cities in both the developed and the developing world.""  The cities in network promote their local creative scene and conform to UNESCO’s goal of fostering cultural diversity. 

&gt;An important aspect of the ""Creative Cities"" concept is that the cities foster public/private partnerships particularly by encouraging the entrepreneurial and creative potential of small enterprises. Literature is just one of several categories of Creative Cities. Others include music, film, media, gastronomy, crafts and folk art, and design.

This is a non-moving, city (not state) violation and it does not go on your state driving record.  Fine is the same, expect to pay it.
- Go into the hearing, the judge will accept the prosecutors recommendation, agree to the plea, leave and pay the fine.

By bus it takes 52 minutes and the last bus leaves before my last class ends. I don't mind a bit of inconvenience and a long ride if it means I don't have to drive my car, but the fact I'd be missing ~50 minutes of my last class was a big downer.

In addition to the inconvenience of the ride length and bus times, I calculated the costs of paying for bus fare every day Monday through Friday versus fueling my 18-20 MPG car. Paying for bus fare for the quarter would have costed me ~$275. Estimated cost of fueling my car would cost ~$260.

"Ever see someone smoking weed or pissing or drinking beer in public?  How about speeding?  Not coming to a complete stop on red? The fact that they aren't arrested or ticketed (even when a cop sees them) doesn't mean they aren't illegal.  I mean, right? I'm not trying to be a jerk, but you said that this wasn't a rhetorical question. Surely you don't think that all crime is prosecuted.  

Why do you think that allowing any company to have 150 drivers in service at any given moment will not allow ridesharing to thrive in Seattle?   Where have you heard that the legislation proposed will kill the rideshares?  Oh right, from the same people who have spread misinformation, threats, operated illegally, and refuse to release information.

So here's my question for you.  Why do you believe them?   How did you become convinced that it's these cab drivers, and not the out-of-town billionaires bankrolling the rideshares, that are the big-monied interests?  How do you know that the current proposal, that allows for 450 rideshares operating at any given moment, will kill the industry, or isn't enough?  The rideshare companies won't even tell you (or the city) how many are operating now.

"Society does not tell people they need a house, and if you buy a house because you think other people are telling you it's something you need, then you're probably not making very wise decisions to start with.  However, buying a house is a great way to keep the money you're paying for housing, instead of paying someone else's mortgage for them.

I purchased a house because over the past few years, if you have the money for a down payment, it's cheaper than renting and the money I'm spending on it is staying in my possession.  

I sold my car, and a whole mess of other items just to come up with the money to buy this place.   We bought it at the absolute right time... bottom of the lowest prices of the crash, and super low interest rate (3.65%). The property values in my neighborhood are going up at a rate of 5%-20% a year.  Since I've lived here my property value has gone up over $100K and I've only made $72K in payments on it.  Paying the mortgage is basically like putting money in a savings account with high interest.

And it's not like it takes a lot of money to get started... one of my friends bought a beat up place in Othello for like $140K.. his mortgage payment is super low.. he fixed the place up with little more than sweat equity, paint, and second hand appliances, and it's worth about twice what he paid for it now.

"Traditional cable television is dying.  Streaming video is the future and people are already embracing it.  I downgraded my Premium Plus Comcast package to Basic and have pretty much exclusively watched content via my little Roku device.   Netflix, Amazon Prime, NBA League Pass, Hulu Plus... there's rarely any reason to watch Comcast cable anymore.  And I always find their system extremely slow and painful to navigate.  Finding a movie through their obsolete ""On Demand"" system is just awful when compared to the ease-of-use of something like Netflix.  

Alas, none of that is possible without high speed internet... and that's where Comcast has me by the balls.  Once they fully succeed in their monopoly, they can begin enforcing their data cap and suddenly I'll be drowning in overage fees.  SO really there doesn't need to be a cable competitor.  We just need another option for high speed internet.   The gigabit internet thing sounded promising, because it was faster, didn't have data caps and was reasonably priced.   

If you look at how we are consuming media... it's completely going towards streaming video.  You don't need a cable box anymore.  We can access these apps on our iOS device, android, playstation, xbox, wii, roku, smart tv, apple tv, chromecast, laptop, pc, etc...   I've been saying for a while that two things could bring Comcast to it's knees.  #1 - If HBO starts allowing you to pay for HBO GO without a cable subscription.  #2 - If we had a high speed internet alternative.    If both of those things were to happen, I think Comcast/Time Warner would begin to die without innovation.

A couple roommates who, through a contract took on responsbilities of the landlord, tried to screw me earlier this year on something similar. They weren't smart enough to send me my deposit and itemized list within 14 days, though, so I sent them a request to pay me or I would take them to court and fight for as much as I could get. They immediately complied and deposited the money into my bank account that day. 

If I were you, I'd send a very threatening letter via email and snail mail with links/copy to the law and hope that you scare him shitless into paying you back asap. Set a deadline for him to pay you back before you file a claim. Ideally, you avoid court altogether.

"&gt; It's not about deterring crime, it's based on a moral imperative

I disagree.  I don't give a dang about ""morals"" and ""just punishment"" in our corrections system.  I want a corrections system that will deter crime so that it doesn't happen in the first place.  Many countries without the death penalty have found other ways to deter crime.

&gt; It costs peanuts in the overall scheme of the state budget

And given our state budget system right now we could sure use those peanuts.  Also, think about how many school lunches (just for an example) could be bought for the cost of one set of appeals.  I think that is a far better use of money than making sure someone dies.

&gt; Until recently most convictions have been based on unreliable witness testimony. The advent of modern technologies significantly reduces false convictions, and creates cases where there is truly 0 doubt.

Until we reach a society with absolutely zero false convictions (which we haven't), I am against it.

&gt; The definition of torture involves pain, execution is painless (as best we can tell)

You need to read up on our methods of execution then, especially lethal injection.

&gt; He's generally not someone you want to qoute.

Doesn't mean I don't agree with the sentiment of the quote chosen.  Hitler isn't a great person in the scheme of history, but he has several quotes which can really speak to people (which, admittedly, is part of how he was able to come to power, but that's a different story)

&gt; Personally I think gay marriage is barbaric and the mark of a culture not smart enough to acknowledge the facts of biology over emotions, but I recognize I have no right to push my personal feelings onto the rest of the state and voted for it.

And I expressed my opinion here just as you did in voting against gay marriage (and, in my opinion, on the same side of history as segregationists, but that is not the debate we are having right now).  And just as Inslee did with his actions today.  He is merely suspending executions (which, given our death row system, would not likely have happened all too soon anyway) while he tries to get the state legislature to abolish the death penalty.  That's fully within his power that we, as a state, gave him when we elected him Governor.",false,true,t1_cfdau4k,Jdog2010,,0,1392191365,t5_2qhad,t3_1xmu1z,t1_cfdalc9,4,1432362149,0,0,cfdau4k,Seattle,4,,,

"I'm not really sure what is going in the pictures and costume.

First, there is nothing blatantly jewish. There are no payot curls, he's not holding a manora, he doesn't have a star of David necklace. At least that is shown in the picture. As someone said without the nose it looks more Amish than anything. (Good thing they don't have internet so they can't complain!)

Second, which of course leads to, why does this HAVE to be a jewish outfit? Because of a big nose? Is that really what we are basing all of this on? I think if he was purposefully being jewish there would be more to it, hence the first paragraph.

Third however, is what was he supposed to be? Who would go to a costume party with ""random items""? That is where the ammo for the argument comes from and it seems pretty dumb on his part.

However at the end of the day it isn't blatantly offensive or Jewish and seems kind of ridiculous.
