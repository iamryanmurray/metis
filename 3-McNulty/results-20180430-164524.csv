"Text behind the comic

&gt;I’m not “from” Seattle.  I’m from Sumner, which you did not know was even a town.  Then I was from Spokane, which we moved to because my father was working out of a train yard over there.  After we moved, he started “getting stationed” near Sumner.  So the facts were all there, if you were conscious; if you could perceive them as being facts.

&gt;I mentioned Fremont last time -  the funny story about Fremont is that there isn’t very much of it.  People are very defensive of it as a result.  But when I first moved here I lived in West Seattle, where the rats were, if you’ve been reading that long.  I had to pick up Brenna in Fremont once, and I was so uncalibrated to the scale of this place that I thought I was downtown.  That’s not downtown, it’s a couple fucking blocks.  But it was dark, and bright, and rainy, so my mind unfolded that fractal and made from it a town.

&gt;I didn’t actually understand what it was like to love the place you were from, that seemed like a weird thing to love.  I’ve never chosen my town, anyway.  Moving to Seattle was a prerequisite for marriage, and I believed - largely correctly - that I live way too deep in my own head to notice where I store my barely animated husk.

&gt;I occasionally raise periscope, though, in moments of relative safety, and when I see some holistic arugula or whatever I’m glad of the phytonutrients.  It’s a good place for your clutch to pupate, indeed, effectively gating the various forms of stimulation is the challenge.  There’s something for people do here besides Meth, using it or making it, which is more than I can say for the last town.

"&gt; Men can walk around topless in short shorts just because the sun is out and they're not automatically seen as asking for anything, pushing an agenda or making a statement beyond ""this is comfortable.""

Men and women's bodies are different, they have private parts in different parts of their bodies.  Both should conceal their ""private"" parts of their body.  Exactly the same for both sexes.  Women are already free to be comfortable so long as they dress appropriately, just like men.

&gt; Just because someone wants to wear something, nothing or anything at all doesn't simply mean ""sexual objectification"" because this happens in the viewer and third party, not the individual wearing whatever they want.

We have clothes in our society, If you walk around naked or nearly naked you are making a choice and objectifying yourself to that end.  Everyone has access to some sort of clothing so to decide not to use them is a definitive choice to bring attention to yourself.  There are plenty of nudist communities that are available if you want to walk around naked without the stigma.

&gt;There aren't actually any natural, physical laws that says that you can't be intelligent, capable, worthy and sexually active or self-empowered or just expressive. A woman's brain doesn't suddenly turn off if she's naked or dressed in a fishnet catsuit. Likewise, her brain isn't suddenly more powerful if she's wearing a modest business suit.

No, but how a person (not just women) is perceived is greatly affected by how they present themselves to the world.  If I want to be perceived as professional, I wear nice and clean professional clothes, and if I wanted to be perceived as a slob I would wear dirty, torn, and ill fitting garments.  The same goes for women too, how they present themselves is how they are going to be perceived (as with men also).  The images from the ""slut walks"" reinforce this point in that many of the women dress intentionally ""slutty"" and say society should not look at the way they present themselves and make a judgement.  It is a choice how you present yourself.  

A woman would be well served if she separated the notion she has to use her body as a tool to convey a message.  This is the point you all miss, these women feel that the only way they can get the point across is using the bodies of the women instead of their words and intelligence.  They have a strong case, they don't need to devalue it by objectifying themselves.

&gt;Further, you don't know how these women normally dress, what they do for a living or how smart they are or aren't by what they're wearing. You're making assumptions.

So are you saying I should assume these women are uneducated sluts?  I don't subscribe to that school of thought like you do.


&gt;No, perhaps they shouldn't have to.

But you can't actually assume that all of the women there are dressing provocatively to make that point. You need to understand - women also dress up just for themselves, and only for themselves and not necessarily for any given viewer.

These women dress up for the ""slut walk"" to make their point.  It is not like a bunch of women coincidentally dressed provocatively and randomly ended up at the cites of the slut walks???  The slut walks are a protest and organized, these women are using their bodies to make their point.

&gt;  On purpose to appear seductive or sexual by using their bodies as the conduit to send their message.

And how does that make you, personally, think or feel? Have you considered the possibility that that is the ammunition they have at hand?

A woman's body is not a tool or object like ammunition, I though that is what they are protesting.  If they use their bodies in that way they are defeating their own cause.


&gt;No, they're mainly fighting against sexual violence, assault and rape and the ideas that being sexually active as a woman (a ""slut"" as opposed to ""stud"") is bad, that how they dress or choose to appear or even behave with selected people isn't an invitation for sexual violence.

This mantra stems from viewing women and their bodies as objects to be used by men, THAT is what they are opposing.  You list all the secondary effects of this mindset.

&gt; The very idea that being naked or dressed in revealing clothing makes it an invitation for sexual advances, assaults or violence. The idea that - culturally - men can't help themselves. The idea that ""What were you wearing?"" is an appropriate question for the police to ask when a woman reports a rape. The idea that being a sexually active woman makes it somehow ok or less bad that that woman is raped. Or that any of these things means she was ""asking for it"".

How a woman dresses is never an invitation.  Men never have this excuse to use against women.  Again, if woman say their bodies (or presentation of such in certain attire) aren't tools, then they should not use their bodies as such.


&gt;And, for the record? When women fought for the right to vote in the US, they employed similar tactics. They did taboo things like wearing trousers, showing a bit of ankle - not to mention behaving in ""unladylike"" ways by being loud, uppity and aggressive.

How is that applicable, they were arguing for the right to vote, not against their bodies being used by men?

&gt;The same things happened in the 60s with women's lib and the Equal Rights Amendment. Women burned their bras and went around braless, which was incredibly taboo at the time.

Again, their protests were not counter to their arguments unlike today.

&gt;This is a straw man argument, but, yeah, there's not really any philosophical difference between raising a cow and a dog for food.

This is not a straw man if the argument is applicable.  The argument is that there are different norms in different cultures. We make judgements based upon our culture and society.  What is socially unacceptable (ie eating dogs) is perfectly acceptable in others.  You stated that some cultures walk around naked so we should be able to as well.  Again, we can not make those judgements based upon other cultures, only on our own.

What I'd do (if I wasn't about to leave for a camping trip tomorrow morning):

1. Set up a sign-up sheet using Google forms; get email addresses and/or phone numbers.  Better a form than a spreadsheet, as that way ppl don't see each other's info.  If you need a mod to vouch for you, I'm happy to do that.

1. Send every person in this thread who has expressed interest a link to the Google form.

1. Contact /u/mayoredmurray and /u/officeofmayor - ask them if you can organize a bunch of like-minded citizens a la the [Summer graffiti paint out](http://www.seattle.gov/util/EnvironmentConservation/OurCity/Graffiti_Prevention_&amp;_Removal/VolunteertoCleanUpGraffiti/SummerPaintOut/index.htm) to fix the graffiti done at Gas Works.  Maybe call the dude who has his phone number at the bottom of that page as well?

1. Make a post about cleaning up the graffiti.  Put the Google form link in it (and probably the link to the article about the incident).

1. Put a link into the ""What's happening this week"" post.

1. Ask mods to sticky your post when the ""What's happening post"" isn't stickied.  I can do this when I get back on Sunday afternoon / evening.

1. ?????

1. Go clean up Gas Works!

I'd start this, but as I wrote, I'm outta here for the rest of the week almost immediately.

"The director's rule slowed down innovation and competition.

Is this your first time in this subreddit? We've had discussions on the director's rule many times here, it pops up in many of the ""our internet sucks"" threads.

The way it works is, if you want to install above-ground equipment, you need 60% approval from property owners within 100ft of the center of the cabinet. If a property owner fails to respond, their abstention is treated as a NO vote.

So basically, the out-of-state property owners who do nothing but use Seattle to collect rent money were able to prevent us from getting faster internet simply by ignoring each and every one of these requests.

It will be a great thing if we can finally kill this bullshit rule.

The ride for me in Oct was pretty uneventful but the captain said he would slow down if anyone spotted whales which I thought was pretty cool (we didn't see any).

"I was trying to tease out that the trends may be class-based trends rather than race-based trends, but obscured because the distribution of races across economic classes is uneven.

In other words, if working class &amp; middle class people have been getting displaced out of Seattle, this may be happening equally for both white and black working class people, while they are getting replaced with more affluent gentrifiers, few of whom tend to be black. 

Your article suggests that this is a trend specific to black people, and my point is that you should have checked the underlying dynamics to verify that that is actually the case.

Related but separate, and a bit nitpicky but important for the impression that's given: it's possible for the average income for a group to go down without any specific person's income going down, if the population is changing. Your headline is ""city's black households get poorer"", but what percentage of individual households actually saw an income decline? Or is the trend in the average completely due to displacement? 

(To be clear, I think it's important to signal that the black community isn't benefiting and to show some data. I'm not trying to argue that there's no fairness and equal opportunity issue here. But I think it's useful to know what's actually happening.)

&gt;___I'm Still Here___ is a 2010 [mockumentary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mockumentary)  film directed by [Casey Affleck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casey_Affleck), and written by Affleck and [Joaquin Phoenix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joaquin_Phoenix). The film purports to follow the life of Phoenix, from the announcement of his retirement from acting, through his transition into a career as a [hip hop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_music) artist.  Filming officially began on January 16, 2009 at a Las Vegas nightclub.  Throughout the filming period, Phoenix remained in character for public appearances, giving many the impression that he was genuinely pursuing a new career.

"You're not leaving it up to fate though. By finding what you truly enjoy and really pursuing it, you are making yourself more dedicated, more well rounded person. This will make your more confident and less worried about dating. 

You say you do a wide array of things that you enjoy, and develop yourself etc. But what is your passion? What is the one thing that you want to be THE BEST at? That is the thing you need to go after. Whatever it is, however bizarre, embrace it and become the best. 

When I moved here, I only had flings on Tinder and OKCupid. I wasn't really meeting anyone that I wanted to date long term. So I kinda gave up, and started doing exactly what I'm recommending here. My passion is HEMA, Historical European Martial Arts. I fight with swords. I started going to classes for it and in general learning more about it, buying gear for it etc. 

About a month into this, I met someone. I was afraid to tell them about my hobby, and my other nerdy hobbies as well (X-Wing Miniatures, Star Wars paper/pencil RPG) but at the same time I was confident enough in myself that I didn't feel the need to hide it. I'm very much about being yourself, and myself is a huge fuckin' nerd. So I laid it all out and we've been together since, for a few months now. 

Before I started doing HEMA, I was definitely keeping dating in mind too much. Much too much. Since I started following my passion, I've met someone who meshes really well with me.

But of course none of the sex trafficking, prostitution, etc. is actually condoned, coordinated, or controlled by the NFL. It's a by-product of the tourism industry. Your argument is invalid. You're attacking the faults and negative aspects that exist in nearly every corner and industry of the world but you're not offering any legitimate criticism of the game itself. Yes, FIFA is bad. Everyone knows that. The only ones saying otherwise is FIFA themselves. But their corruption, greed, and wrong-doing doesn't diminish the passion or popularity of the game. Just as all of the complicity of the NFL with steroid &amp; drug use, a history of ignoring head injury issues, etc. doesn't take away from the excitement of 106 football players taking 3+ hours to play 60 mins of a game that averages only 11 minutes of action.

Live and let live, Dave. You don't like soccer, fine. That's your prerogative. But allowing those of us who do, without your condemnation or heavy-handed moral objections, doesn't cost you anything.

"That was very well written.

I am not sure why the majority of people online think one must always project themselves as if they are physically in a room full of people....*at least to them*.

While people may maintain a relative balance of character and emotions, many still will respond with more vehemence, disregard, and vitriol than the majority of them *ever* would in real life. When people's emotions run is when you see the real version of them, negative or positive.

I don't think that the internet requires this. I have been around reddit for a long time. I have been around BBS boards for even longer, going on 17 years now. It's only quite recently that the internet is so full of garbage people. 

You don't know who I am. Most other places, I love to be nice to people online....*Reddit?*

I used to be *really, really* into Reddit. It was almost all I did. For 2 years. Before the Rage Comic Rage. And after RCR almost as exclusively.

In this site exists a hivemind/groupthink phenomenon that is disgustingly hypocritical, wondrously helpful and useful, but deluded. 

I don't have to prove this to anybody. It is frequently commented upon now. A lot of Reddit has begun to see faults in itself. Some are in denial.

I fight fire with fire. I try to be objective, and yeah, I may lean in to somebody for being dismally unoriginal or for perpetuating trends that a large part of the community find abhorrent, but I am never cruel or mean. If you really think I am, I can link you a few users that would probably shock you, and put me in perspective.





You will also notice that people *do not* like being called on their shit. People flip the fucking fuck out and get *super* defensive on the drop of a hat here. And as soon as somebody pulls the ""bigot/sexist/racist/homophobe"", whether legitimate or not (60% not) card on somebody's opinion, the hivemind just abuses the shit out of the arrows and smashes that person into obscurity.

The problem is that most of the time it's *not* a troll, it's somebody with a legitimate unpopular opinion. Yes, it may be a bit harsh sometimes. But imagine if you disagreed with your friends and they just shut you up every time you disagreed with them? When you do say something you're going to be a bit pre-perturbed. The only caveat is that you have to be prepared to talk out your point civilly.

&gt; It's naive to think that single case is the only case every protestor cares about.

I explained the author, in his essay, was focusing his narrative on one case, however acknowledging systemic issues. Here's where the author of the post you didn't read explains the systemic nature you claim I'm unaware of.

&gt; However, the judicial process does not have room to accommodate multiple spectacles. That is why the courtroom and legal process becomes the center of attention in these situations: to see which Spectacle will carry the day. Part of the protesters' narrative was that ""the fix is in,"" the enduring belief that the authorities would protect themselves and deny the legitimacy of the community's grievances. To be honest, that view is largely correct due to the tendency of ""White Spectacles"" to be privileged and advanced beyond what is truthfully warranted. Just another aspect of white privilege; because when confronted with competing information, the human tendency is to return to default and use our previous biases to evaluate the current situation, and the default status in our society is still white privilege.

I don't think we disagree on the fact that this happens all too often and with too little consequence.

They cannot be higher than 7 feet either. Sometimes if you miss your p's and q's others will feel its their responsibility to correct that by removing signs. I dont think this man has any more or less weight in knowing where the animal is. Just that he hates imperfection and nuisance. I mean this guy wrote about private land being private land, you shouldnt even pick a flower or two from that property. They should focus their resources on finding the dog before this person decides to take them to court for inciting a Facebook witchhunt. Bring Deuce Home needs to do a better job of moderating its users comments, a lot of them are defamatory and maiming in quality. I really mean it, a lot of them on there are plotting and conspiring yet there is no evidence of the man having the dog. Just like there was no evidence of melissa b stealing Nahla the ""stolen"" dog when in actuality Mary didnt care to watch the dog properly. I'm just an observer and I stand behind what I believe in. Maybe this guy just has a personal grudge against lost dogs, he might have lost his at one point? My advice is bring deuce home needs to make exactly sure the signs comply with this site http://www.seattle.gov/transportation/posteringrules.htm, collect evidence for the real police not the facebook self appointees, and moderate some of those bent readers. Some of them are really out of control now.

"UW's Total Cost of Attendance for Freshman suggests allowing for ~$47k/year.

As far as how to support yourself after going to school -- the best advice I can make in any city, but especially in more expensive cities, is to use your time in school to train for a career that is both personally fulfilling and highly compensated.  Also use this time to get as much work experience as you can and develop relationships -- both will matter much more in terms of finding the best opportunities after you're done with school.

From there, it's a matter of budgeting carefully based on your income, living within your means (including accounting for any and all debts), etc.

Getting a well-compensated job (such as an engineer at Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook, Google, etc) certainly wouldn't hurt the financial side of things, but you shouldn't just go into computer science / engineering for the money.  (a) because you'll hate yourself if you're not truly passionate about it and (b) because if you're not passionate then you won't invest the time and effort into becoming a highly competitive applicant (and thereby won't qualify for those jobs anyway).",false,true,t1_chfjgz1,drakontas,,0,1399853616,t5_2qhad,t3_25bd6r,t3_25bd6r,4,1433754377,0,0,chfjgz1,Seattle,4,,,

"I believe people really are not paying attention and the signage just doesn't register, plus there are a lot of people who are not used to downtown driving.

Example: There is a McDonalds across from where I work and I see people confused as hell about what is on the menu, what comes with their combo-meal, what the price is, where to pick up their order when its ready, what their order number is and where to find the straws every time I go in there. And it's not like its a confusing avant-garde McDonalds that only allows payment in bitcoin. Sure I understand a lot of people simply never go to fast food, but it's McDonalds.

I imagine its the same kind of people driving downtown. For one, they don't have the interest to care that there is a red ""do not turn"" or  a green ""bikes only"" light. If its not in the usual place where the traffic signals are, it just doesn't register. They received their license 10-20-50 years ago and as far as they're concerned driving and traffic infrastructure hasn't changed since then. I also think a lot of people driving downtown don't live in the city and are stressed out and already afraid about making a mistake, so they rush and get tunnel vision. Haste makes waste! 

We've all been there. ""holy shit is this a one way street?"" as you turn down a street with cars parked on the wrong side of the street, for example. My wife hates driving downtown because its stressful and we've lived in major metropolitan areas for the last 10 years.

I also believe this isn't the best system. As a cyclist who enjoys driving, I recently drove down 2nd and experienced the new bike lane and although I couldn't immediately suggest improvements, I recognized that its not the best user experience. So in a way, don't hate the player, hate the game. the DOT is doing their best with what they're given (budget, timing, bureaucracy, other factors citizens don't realize).

Truman discarded all of his concerns about the volcano and his situation, at one point stating, ""If the mountain goes, I'm going with it. This area is heavily timbered, Spirit Lake is in between me and the mountain, and the mountain is a mile away, the mountain ain't gonna hurt me... boy."" [4] According to The Bulletin, he responded to being knocked from his bed by precursor earthquakes by moving his mattress to his basement.[2] At one point, Truman ""scoffed""[2] at the public's concern for his safety.

To claim that to leave your home on a mountain that is about to erupt would kill you is to be extremely melodramatic.  He could have gone and lived forty miles away in the same mountains.

"Hi there! Great idea - please consider the following as well: 
There is also already a Civilian Emergency Response Team for King County: http://www.kingcounty.gov/safety/prepare/residents-business/CommunityPreparedness/CitizenCorp-CERT.aspx

And also one for public health/medical reserve corps if you're a health professional/auxillary: http://www.kingcounty.gov/healthservices/health/preparedness/phreservecorps.aspx

I went to the orientation for the medical reserve corps last month. The MRC, PHRC and CERT organizers help with things like:

 1) making sure everyone has the credentials they say they do (medical/nursing/dental/professional license, CPR, first aid, blood borne pathogen training, etc) and that these credentials are up to date. 

2) making sure everyone knows the protocols - it doesn't help to have people show up at an emergency scene without direction, while well intentioned, could be dangerous and haphazard 

3) authorizing deployment - say the Eastside has a problem, they'd deploy the volunteers from Seattle since the volunteers from the Eastside will probably be busy dealing with their personal property/family. 

4) providing training so that everyone is on the same page - like knowing how a chain of command works, understanding FEMA response protocols, etc, and 

5) holding community wide drills to roll out and practice emergency response techniques (I know they've done a few at the airport, Seattle Center, and at the fire response training center). 

These organizations were put in place by federal government initiatives after 9/11. Apparently well intentioned people volunteered in droves, but it was too unorganized and volunteers ended up getting hurt and hindering ongoing rescue efforts. Hope this helps!

 [**Banana equivalent dose**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana%20equivalent%20dose): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;

&gt;A __banana equivalent dose__ (abbreviated __BED__) is a unit of [radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation) exposure, defined as the additional dose a person will absorb from eating one [banana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana).

&gt;The concept is based on the fact that bananas, like most organic materials, naturally contain a certain amount of [radioactive isotopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_isotope)—even in the absence of any contamination due to human nuclear endeavors. The banana equivalent dose was meant to express the severity of exposure to radiation, such as resulting from [nuclear power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power), [nuclear weapons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon) or medical procedures, in terms that would make sense to most people.

&gt;====

"Thank you. Based on the number of ""I'm moving to Seattle and have some questions"" and ""Visiting soon, can someone recommend a hiking spot"" posts I see it just seems like the related subreddit list barely gets ventured into even though it's right there on the sidebar.

I see what you are saying but a number of people in this subreddit post pictures of their weekend excursions out of the city and I think other people come to our sub and see that and want to experience it themselves.

Seems relevant to Seattle to me in that it keeps Satellites and visitors to our city safe while providing them with great recreation and more reason to visit Seattle and the Northwest.

I also thought it could serve as a good place for us to pool our trip reports/photos within /r/Seattle instead of all the posts that come on Monday with each person sharing their weekend trip.

I was born and raised in Seattle and I've in fact flown on Kenmore Air. The regulation in question is what defines an AIRPORT. An AIRPORT isn't any location an aircraft takes off and lands from.

"&gt; DC beltway traffic is as bad or worse

I'm well aware of that I have family in Richmond and I've driven there several times from DC.  

&gt; doesn't go many places when compared to cities like Boston or nyc

Well its sure better then here!  In the two weeks that I was with my girlfriend I had only one bad experience using the metro (some old black guy said I was a ""race traitor"" because my girlfriend is Chinese... and I'm white) and we were able to go almost everywhere touristy or not.  If we wanted to go somewhere nice we were only a stop away and unlike here we could completely skip the traffic and take the metro.  Want to go to a monument or see where some of my family is in Arlington cemetery?  Only a few stops away!

I was born and raised in Magnolia, people here joke that we live on an island and I believe them.  The bus at the stop a block away comes once every 45 minutes and is always too early or too late.  Even though we live close to downtown it takes forever to get there and commuting to Ballard for work or to college is a huge pain in the ass.  When my girlfriend wants to go to Georgetown for her gradschool or her internship she is about 5-20 minutes away.  And besides if I really want to get out of DC I can always just take an Amtrak to NYC or Richmond to see friends in college or family

"&gt; That's not the best analogy. There are countless used cars always becoming available, once driven off a lot a new car's price on the open market drops drastically, it is just incredibly easy to find affordable cars as opposed to housing.

Exactly! Because there isn't very much artificial restriction on the supply. Sure there are regulations to make sure the cars are safe, somewhat less worse on the environment, yadda, yadda. But the government isn't restricting the supply by saying ""you can only build X cars this year."" It isn't the perfect analogy, but it does somewhat work. By placing all these restrictions on housing the supply is limited, which raises the cost for all housing.

&gt; I've talked about these issues with them and tenants.

I am skeptical that you've actually talked to tenants in apodments and hear them all complain about how much they hate living there. I've seen a few stories on local news about it and the people they interview seem to be fine. I just don't feel like it is cool for us to make decisions about what is and is not enough space for other people. Make the sure the spaces are safe and livable, but otherwise restricting them will only increase cost. There are plenty of single people who don't want a bunch of space. This works for them. Also for people who live a long way from Seattle but work here during the week.

I'm not saying apodments are THE answer or that they should be a substitute for affordable family housing. I'm just saying restricting them doesn't help the situation and most likely hurts it.

&gt; Dividing 1,200 square feet for four people is very different from living in a 300 square foot apartment by yourself. You are no longer sharing furniture, electronics, dishes, etc. The space ends up being MUCH smaller.

Um, apodments have shared space too. That is the whole point. You have a little room with a bathroom and kitchenette, but they provide shared kitchen, laundry, patios, etc. Read about one here: http://apodment.com/cortena.htm They are kind of like fancy college dorms (mine certainly didn't have its own bathroom and kitchenette). 

&gt; I'm getting the feeling you're a libertarian with your constant statements that the market will solve the housing problems we're facing.

Ha ha, my libertarian friends call me a communist. I can't win. I'd say I'm a mix of things. In our two party system I vote pretty exclusively democrat. I do like some libertarian ideas, but I don't believe the market will fix all problems, not by a long shot. I do think housing is one area most liberals get backwards. ""Rents are too high!"" So what's the solution? ""Rent control!"" It is totally illogical. This really is a econ 101 problem. Supply is lower than demand. There are lots of ways to increase the supply. I think the easiest first step is to vastly reform the land use code so developers (and regular people who own property) can build more units on the existing land. As I said multiple times, I don't think that is going to solve the problem for low income housing. We need more government intervention for that. But for middle and upper the market can solve the problem. And I think it can happen at the same time. Trading increased FAR for affordable housing units, either in the same development or another, makes a lot of sense to me.

&gt; You seem to be getting angry for some reason. Relax, we agree about the bigger issue.

You mistake my passion for anger. I'm not angry. It just amazes me that people think the way to stabilize the cost of something is government intervention. There are some cases where that is true (government sponsored monopolies like utilities, for example), but I don't think housing is one of them.",false,true,t1_cfjlnfm,WalterBrickyard,Greenwood,0,1392848943,t5_2qhad,t3_1yd8nq,t1_cfjjxta,2,1432471459,0,0,cfjlnfm,Seattle,2,,flair,

"Just so we can get it out of the way, I'll start with the obligatory ""read-the-sidebar"" comment.  There's good info there.

Now then...  What kind of food do you guys like?  What's your budget?  Seattle is best known for seafood, of course, and some Asian cuisines (there's a Thai restaurant on every commercial block--I think it's in the zoning regulations).  We're very big on the farm-to-table, fresh and local thing.  I wouldn't generally bother with pizza or Mexican food here--there are some good places, but a lot of bad ones, and they just do that better elsewhere.

Is your girlfriend looking for a practitioner-oriented degree (masters or doctorate), or a research-oriented Ph.D. program?

Just in general...Pike Place Market is a must-see, IMHO.  Go early in the day--the cruise ships are here by June and it's absolutely mobbed with tourists then, but mornings are a little less so.  If you can stand it, go around 7 am, get breakfast at [Lowells](http://eatatlowells.com/) or the [Athenian](http://www.athenianinn.com/), enjoy the view, and watch the Market wake up and get ready for the day.  Or, if you're there at lunchtime, get a grilled salmon or halibut sandwich at the [Market Grill](http://www.urbanspoon.com/r/1/4369/restaurant/Downtown/Market-Grill-Seattle).  Everything there is super-fresh and delicious, and the ringside seat to the madness that is the Market at high tourist season is free.  Be sure to wander around in the odd corners of the Market--get down in the levels under the Main Arcade, and off in the back of the buildings on the north side of Pike Place.  There are some great, oddball little shops back there, as well as some well-known ghosts, it's said.  A lot of tourists see the Main Arcade and the North Arcade and think they've seen it all, but not so.

Personally, I've enjoyed the [Ride the Ducks](http://www.ridetheducksofseattle.com/) tour and the [Underground Tour](https://www.undergroundtour.com/) at Pioneer Square--both hokey and touristy, but hey, you ARE tourists, right?  Ride the Ducks gives you a decent overview of some of the tourist high points, plus it gets you out on Lake Union.  The Underground Tour will tell you a lot about Seattle's early days.  If you prefer your history unsanitized, the [Underworld Tour](https://www.undergroundtour.com/underworld/index.html) is a little less family-friendly and more focused on historic sleaze.

To fully experience Seattle, you definitely should get out on the water.  The cheapest way is to walk on the Bainbridge Island ferry from downtown.  On the island, walk up a short hill to Winslow Way, the main drag there, and turn left.  There are a few blocks of shops and restaurants.  Grab lunch at the [Streamliner Diner](http://streamlinerdiner.com/) or the [Harbour House Pub](http://harbourpub.com/), or coffee and a pastry at [Blackbird Bakery](http://blackbirdbakery.com/), or an ice cream at [Mora](http://moraicecream.com/).  For a more upscale dinner, [Restaurant Marche](http://restaurantmarchebainbridge.com/) and [Four Swallows](http://fourswallows.com/) get good reviews.  If you can time it right, the ferry back at dusk, with the sky darkening and the city skyline lighting up, is gorgeous.

Or, if you want a boat trip that comes with a salmon dinner and some unique local entertainment, try [Tillicum Village](http://www.argosycruises.com/tillicum-village/) on Blake Island.

Here's a suggestion for a nice day trip:  Head out I-90 to [Snoqualmie Falls](http://www.snoqualmiefalls.com/).  Ooh and aah at the falls, take pictures, maybe walk the trail down to the bottom.  Back in the car, find your way to [Highway 203](http://washingtonhighways.blogspot.com/2012/06/washington-state-route-203.html) northbound.  This will take you through the Snoqualmie Valley, which is just a pretty, lush, green area that hasn't been swallowed by development yet.  You can take Hwy 203 all the say up to Monroe and circle back from there, or you can take one of several roads that cut off west from Highway 203.  Returning through [Woodinville](http://woodinvillewinecountry.com/) is good if you like wine--lots of wineries and tasting rooms there.  [Snohomish](http://www.historicdowntownsnohomish.org/antiques.asp) has a lot of antique stores, if you're at all into that.

Or another nice day trip:  drive the [loop around Mount Rainier](http://www.visitrainier.com/pg/driving_tour_circle_rainier/Circle-Mt-Rainier-National-Park-Driving-Tour)  With luck the roads will all be open by then, but [check here](http://www.nps.gov/mora/planyourvisit/road-status.htm) before you leave, just to be sure.  Lots of great hiking opportunities along the way there.

Yet another day out of the city:  Drive north in I-5 to Anacortes (detour through [La Conner](http://www.lovelaconner.com/) if you like lots of twee little shops with pretty, expensive stuff), then across [Deception Pass](http://www.whidbeycamanoislands.com/thingstodo/parks_scenery/parks/deceptionpass/) (more great photo ops and hiking trails) and down [Whidbey Island](http://www.whidbeycamanoislands.com/).  You'll take the ferry back from Clinton to Mukilteo at the south end (not really recommended on a summer Sunday afternoon unless you don't mind a wait).

"It did in 1990, but this was the fault of the folks servicing it at the time.  Also, my grandfather wasn't the lead on that project, he was one of many engineers.

&gt; In 1990, while under construction, the original bridge sank because of a series of human errors and decisions. The process started because the bridge needed resurfacing and was to be widened by means of cantilevered additions in order to meet the necessary lane-width specifications of the Interstate Highway System. The Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) decided to use hydrodemolition (high-pressure water) to remove unwanted material (the sidewalks on the bridge deck). Water from this hydrodemolition was considered contaminated under environmental law and could not be allowed to flow into Lake Washington.[10] Engineers then analyzed the pontoons of the bridge, and realized that they were over-engineered and the water could be stored temporarily in the pontoons. The watertight doors for the pontoons were therefore removed.

&gt;A large storm on November 22-24, 1990 (the Thanksgiving holiday weekend), filled some of the pontoons with rain and lake water. On November 24, workers noticed that the bridge was about to sink, and started pumping out some of the pontoons. However, on November 25, 2,790 ft (850 m) of the bridge sank, dumping the contaminated water into the lake along with tons of bridge material. The bridge sank when one pontoon filled and dragged the rest down because they were cabled together and there was no way to separate the sections under load. No one was hurt or killed, since the bridge was closed for renovation and the sinking took some time. All of the sinking was captured on film and shown on live TV. The cost of the disaster was $69 million in damages.",false,false,t1_clzqw0x,barlister,Mountlake Terrace,0,1415741258,t5_2qhad,t3_2lz2q1,t1_clzqrti,4,1426073911,0,0,clzqw0x,Seattle,4,,flair,

Goddamn it NO.  This is a stupid idea that never should have taken over so many industries in the U.S.

If you get a liquor license from the city, it's not yours to sell for a million bucks to someone else.  The license belongs to the city that granted it to you.

This setup hurts everyone.  It's the reason the taxis come out and lobby like hell to prevent an increase in the number of taxis -- because they are treating their license as a tradable commodity.  It's regulatory capture -- and it should be done away with.

"What's kind of sad is that there's no reason why you couldn't experience right now wherever you're living, but we seem to need to light up our cities like Christmas trees, and a number of studies have shown that street lights apparently don't prevent crime but increase it through a number of factors. Street lights basically provide convenient light for car break-ins, prowling and such. Bright street lights also wreck our night vision and provide shadows that are easier for criminals to hide in.

There is a small, totally ineffective movement mainly led by astronomers to control not just light pollution or trying to change how we light our cities - but to try to have ""lights out"" nights once a month or so so that people can actually see the night sky right over their heads.

But depressingly a lot of people lacking curiosity think that this is some kind of crazy talk. It would be amazing to have a lights out night every other new moon or something, so people could just walk outside and look up without having to travel hours and hours away from cities just to see the stars. It would be even better with organized star-watching block parties with amateur astronomers setting up telescopes for public viewing.

"It's a pretty common dodge for the state or city. They're overworked, understaffed, and the budget is stretched too thin. They literally can't do everything they're supposed to do. So their strongest card to play is the fact that it's difficult and expensive to sue. Also it's pretty hard to win a suit based on a small screw up. The government can screw up. 

Source: I'm a regulatory lawyer. The number of times I basically hear, ""Yeah. We did that. Sue if you want redress,"" is probably 80% of every case. And fwiw, the regulatory lawyers in Seattle are often terrible. (Seattle Nice does not fit well with the personality you need to make a bureaucrat fix your problem). Find a better one if your lawyer came back with anything but, ""It's not my problem to fix your department. You have been confronted with a clear violation and it is UP TO YOU to fix it. Not me and my client. You."" Then he/she/it  should have a list of suggestions for the department that will make you happy, and a few good hints about what might happen if none of those suggestions are followed. And here's a hint: suing is not a good threat. Public embarrassment, class action potential, or fucking with their federal funding is a good threat. 

If I were Dominic, I wouldn't waste my time whining about this one guy.

It was just different -- a low-story business district with very little residential buildings. It was a nice, quiet, very unique, place to live (not at all a drug riddled shit hole). 

Personally, I would have preferred ""The Commons"" park idea to what there is now or back then, but that boat sailed.

"My attitude when I see protests is to say, ""cool!"", take pics and post them on twitter.

That's how someone who is genuinely, emotionally upset about things but who is not actively taking part at that moment reacts. 

Someone who says ""grrrr, this inconveniences me slightly"" can claim that they give a shit, but they can't possibly. That's not how caring about things works. Caring about things isn't just abstract recognition of their importance. If you care, you are willing to be inconvenienced. If you're just towing the blue state line to fit in, you say out loud that you care about things but then when push comes to shove you sacrifice nothing, say nothing, do nothing, and have no intention of making change happen in any way. And those that do, you criticize in order to justify your own laziness (whether to yourself or others.)

&gt; you seem to have no glorious goal, nor concrete policy change, in mind beyond going out there to ""fuck shit up.""

glorious goal: end racism in the CJ system. concrete policy change: getting police prosecuted for crimes they commit, and for discrimination, by prosecutors who give a shit. How hard is that to glean? Civil unrest, uncomfortable, often disorganized civil unrest, gets gears moving in this country. It is ahistorical bullshit to say otherwise.

"Not at all.  It was a big thread talking about the possible throttling here: http://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/1xrlmf/is_comcast_throttling_netflix_in_seattle_post_net/

I posted this in response, since it explains what happened.  The key takeaway is that /u/crawlcastic did do a good experiment, but should have also included traceroutes to help identify what transit providers were involved.  If they had an AppleTV too, would have helped illustrate the transit problem over it being a throttling problem.

I'm personally not much of a fan of lynch mob style tactics.  That method often forgoes looking for the truth.  It's popular and easy to say Comcast is bad and to rally against them due to the reputation they have earned with some of their poor business practices. Though it's more honest to ensure the reasons one rallies against them are true.

I personally don't like Comcast, and will be moving soon specifically to a place where I can get CondoInternet.  My first year here in the city is the first time I've had Comcast service, and had to deal with their issues.

"&gt; did you only focus on the dui law on purpose or did you actually read my whole post? I'm going to guess you read it and just decided to ignore all the other parts of these proposed changes I was talking about so you can keep harping on the DUI law which I already admitted I was wrong about.. None of the changes I was referring to even have anything to do with the DUI law changed under I502.
&gt; I use a GRAM A DAY of RSO for my cancer side affects. I, and I can only speak for myself, will NEVER be pulled over for impairment because I no longer get high. If I get pulled over it will because of something else that leads them to believe I have Cannabis in my system (won't be smell, I don't smoke it) I've been using a gram a day of RSO for over 4 years, I can smoke as much as I want and never feel the effects. I don't even smoke anymore because its a waste of medicine for someone like me. But then again you don't really care about any of that right, you are just here to win some weird internet debate that you already got me to admit I was wrong about.

No, not at all and I apologize if you feel that way.  I actually went back 5-10 minutes ago and re-edited the bottom of my post before you responded with this:

I was confused how the company deploying the system was going recoup the $1M installation cost:

&gt;Securus will recoup the installation cost through system revenues during the first year it is in use, according to the county.

until I reached this:
&gt;Each week, every inmate will be allowed one free 25-minute video call. Each additional video call will cost $12.95, Hayes said. He said the cost is reasonable, noting that some inmate video calls elsewhere can cost as much as $24.95.

I was also kind of shocked at the size of the market (my emphasis):
&gt;In February, the FCC started regulating inmate telephone rates in an effort to end price-gouging.

Yes, so a gas tax is regressive, which you said is unfortunate.  So I'm confused, or maybe you're confused about what would be a ""good"" way to pay for roads.

&gt;You don't drive more because you're wealthy.

I'm not so sure that's true.  I haven't looked at the data to be sure of it, but it seems reasonable to assume that richer people are more likely to live in suburbs and work in cities, thus driving further than poorer folks, who are probably more likely to live in more dense areas, which are likely closer to their jobs.

&gt;Dollar for dollar, poor people are paying more for roads because there are more poor people than wealthy ones.

This is just asinine.  Dollar for dollar, a rich person pays more in taxes than a poor person.  Saying that poor PEOPLE pay more because there are more of them is completely irrelevant, because it's offset by there being, uh...more of them, and therefore more CARS to USE that road.  If a ""rich person"" pays $1000 in taxes, and a poor person pays $500, why shouldn't a rich person get twice as much ""benefit"" out of the road?  That there are 200 people paying $500 and 50 paying $1000 doesn't change any one person's reality of what they pay versus what they get out of it.

"So, I know it is fun to bash cops and shit, but here is the deal with the number of shots fired by police.

Most police are normal human beings, their level of training is not all that much higher than normal people. They are not soldiers (despite how much Reddit loves to talk about the militarization of police) who are trained to kill. They are law enforcement officers trained to do an entirely different job, and SOMETIMES that involves the use of lethal force.

The thing to remember about normal human beings is that they tend to not like to kill each other. Killing each other is usually bad for a species and so over the tens of thousands of years of being human and the millions of years of being primates we pretty much developed a very very strong urge to NOT kill each other. Despite that we figured out along the way that as an intelligent beast we sometimes do need to kill each other, and yes it sucks, and when we have to do it we have to fight against our natural urges to do so. Killing isn't easy.

Guess how many people actively shot at the enemy in WW2? Take a wild one? These were all trained soldiers. Less than 10%. The number of people who actually fired their weapons was slightly higher, but those people shot above their targets or intentionally missed. This is a war that killed tens and tens of millions of people and only 10% did the shooting, heck of that 10% they were accountable for less than 40% of the actual casualties. Artillery fire killed or injured 60% of combatants in WW2, a form of combat that is very easy since the killing is so detached. The rest was made up for by bombings, other forms of combat, including small arms fire.

So what does this say about cops? Well cops are not soldiers. They don't even have the training of a WW2 soldier, who barely fired his weapon at the target and if they did was more likely to miss on purpose (subconsciously though most of the time). This is the same thing that happens with cops. They don't want to kill people (seriously, they don't, only 2% of the population are actual psychotics who can act with out empathy) and they do not have the training to turn that part of their brain off in that situation like modern soldiers do.

This is a good thing. A cop needs to exercise discretion when using lethal force. Sometimes they over react, again, not having that drill level of training is a double edged sword, you don't know how everyone is going to react in a situation that potentially involves mortal combat. Cops are not regimented like soldiers, they go home at night, have family issues, and come to work the next day, it is not as controlled an environment as a military. Most of the time cops do make the right decision, sometimes they do not.

So when you hear about so many rounds being fired at a suspect by police it is most likely not because they are poor shots, but because no one there actually wanted to shoot the person in the first place, but felt they still needed to fire their weapon.

"&gt;If non-transit riders and transit riders alike benefit from transit, I'm having trouble understanding why there should be less of it.

I'm not saying to eliminate transit. Some transit is good, but too much to the point where it's hemorrhaging millions of dollars per year and constantly needing to be propped up by people who don't use its service isn't justifiable to me. Even though this would disproportionally affect me negatively, I'm taking a principled stand here because I don't think that others who don't use Metro should have to subsidize me.

&gt;There's no such thing as a perfectly efficient system. While I do support accountability, I don't think it's wise to cut funding from programs that benefit citizens in an effort to make them more efficient.

How do you support accountability then? Who would be held accountable and how if we continue to underwrite this horrible business model?

&gt;Personally, I think that public schools are horribly inefficient.

Agreed. Every part of the government is horribly inefficient. I do support reducing school funding though. Mostly I mean that to imply that all the money that gets wasted funneling it through Washington DC should be eliminated and the federal government should get out of the education business (and left to parents and local government maybe), but in general I think schools get plenty of money. Spending has gone way up adjusting for inflation in the last 30-40 years and we've seen nothing in the way of increased test scores. It's stagnant. That's not a great return on investment.

&gt;Given your concerns about wasting taxpayer money I wonder what your feelings are about military spending- do you think it should be drastically cut to reduce wasted money?

Absolutely. I think it should be scaled back to a national defense, not offense. The less government the better in my book. I'm Libertarian if you couldn't tell already.

"I'm not sure what was unclear.

- You: ""I'm not convinced... that the terribleness that is 4th ave traffic can withstand an additional lane cut.""

- I pointed out that Biden's motorcade closed 4th through downtown for evening commute, and we did not see significant increases in delay on parallel arterials.

Like most one way urban arterials, the size of the arterial is likely *causing* the traffic. Also, can you cite 2nd ""not being like"" 4th now? I think evening peak traffic may be worse on 2nd than 4th. SDOT produces volume and delay data annually, so you should be able to find this pretty easily and find out if your assertion is right.

Adding bike share increases bicycle safety by putting more riders on the road - this is well documented over and over and over again, regardless of infrastructure. It's the same reason we're working on getting rid of our helmet law (or making it a secondary offense) - the outcome of the additional riders that come from more casual use increases safety more than the outcome of the helmets.

My transit 'idealism' is one thing - me championing things that other cities have done in similar situations. I have never suggested an idea that hasn't been tested somewhere else.

Nobody came forth (but thank you so much for asking!), so I'm probably going to have to take it in and cover it ""for now"".  I am definitely going to take your advice and push the insurance company to investigate--it's not an inexpensive car, so chances are its going to be a good deal of money for them, too.

"&gt; Regardless, the law doesn't include businesses with less than 25 people, so your point is pretty moot.

From my original reply:

&gt; Assuming the bill even has a limit as to which employers would be affected by this, what about those on the ass-end of the margin? Fuck them and their employees?

If you're barely keeping your business afloat and have 24 employees, hiring one more employee is a *huge* barrier. If that pushes your business over the edge into bankruptcy, your employees will have to find new jobs. Based on the latest BLS info, 10 of them will be unemployed for more than 6 months collecting benefits that have to be paid for by everyone still working.

Crossing that threshold, an employee who's been with the company for 5 years will cost the business a minimum of 120 hours x $wage *more* each year.. With a $15/hr minimum wage (also in place in this state) that's $1800/yr or $150/mo *each*.

Taking a conservative estimate of 5 long-term employees that's $750/mo. If the rest of the employees are eligible at the minimum requirement, those will now cost $600/yr more *each*.

Add it all up and that's $13,800/yr our example business would be saddled with - just for mandatory vacation.

What's more likely to happen is we'll see a proliferation of 24-employee businesses that look for every way they can to avoid hiring that 25th Once you start tearing into the details, it's no wonder Big Business is beating out the little guy.

Edit: Oh, and one more - If you're a marginal company with 25-30 employees today, you're staring down the barrel of a new $15,000 bill this year. If you can't pay it and want your business to survive, you're going to fire the least productive people on your staff until you're under 25.",false,true,t1_cezgysz,JeffreyRodriguez,Bainbridge Island,0,1390768263,t5_2qhad,t3_1w59ta,t1_cezg6vs,3,1432117658,0,0,cezgysz,Seattle,3,,flair,

&gt;

&gt;[UNESCO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO)'s __City of Literature__ program is part of its [Creative Cities Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Cities_Network) which was launched in 2004.  The Network was born out of UNESCO's Global Alliance for Cultural Diversity initiative which was created in 2002. Its aim is to ""promote the social, economic and cultural development of cities in both the developed and the developing world.""  The cities in network promote their local creative scene and conform to UNESCO’s goal of fostering cultural diversity. 

&gt;An important aspect of the ""Creative Cities"" concept is that the cities foster public/private partnerships particularly by encouraging the entrepreneurial and creative potential of small enterprises. Literature is just one of several categories of Creative Cities. Others include music, film, media, gastronomy, crafts and folk art, and design.

By bus it takes 52 minutes and the last bus leaves before my last class ends. I don't mind a bit of inconvenience and a long ride if it means I don't have to drive my car, but the fact I'd be missing ~50 minutes of my last class was a big downer.

In addition to the inconvenience of the ride length and bus times, I calculated the costs of paying for bus fare every day Monday through Friday versus fueling my 18-20 MPG car. Paying for bus fare for the quarter would have costed me ~$275. Estimated cost of fueling my car would cost ~$260.

"Ever see someone smoking weed or pissing or drinking beer in public?  How about speeding?  Not coming to a complete stop on red? The fact that they aren't arrested or ticketed (even when a cop sees them) doesn't mean they aren't illegal.  I mean, right? I'm not trying to be a jerk, but you said that this wasn't a rhetorical question. Surely you don't think that all crime is prosecuted.  

Why do you think that allowing any company to have 150 drivers in service at any given moment will not allow ridesharing to thrive in Seattle?   Where have you heard that the legislation proposed will kill the rideshares?  Oh right, from the same people who have spread misinformation, threats, operated illegally, and refuse to release information.

So here's my question for you.  Why do you believe them?   How did you become convinced that it's these cab drivers, and not the out-of-town billionaires bankrolling the rideshares, that are the big-monied interests?  How do you know that the current proposal, that allows for 450 rideshares operating at any given moment, will kill the industry, or isn't enough?  The rideshare companies won't even tell you (or the city) how many are operating now.

"Society does not tell people they need a house, and if you buy a house because you think other people are telling you it's something you need, then you're probably not making very wise decisions to start with.  However, buying a house is a great way to keep the money you're paying for housing, instead of paying someone else's mortgage for them.

I purchased a house because over the past few years, if you have the money for a down payment, it's cheaper than renting and the money I'm spending on it is staying in my possession.  

I sold my car, and a whole mess of other items just to come up with the money to buy this place.   We bought it at the absolute right time... bottom of the lowest prices of the crash, and super low interest rate (3.65%). The property values in my neighborhood are going up at a rate of 5%-20% a year.  Since I've lived here my property value has gone up over $100K and I've only made $72K in payments on it.  Paying the mortgage is basically like putting money in a savings account with high interest.

And it's not like it takes a lot of money to get started... one of my friends bought a beat up place in Othello for like $140K.. his mortgage payment is super low.. he fixed the place up with little more than sweat equity, paint, and second hand appliances, and it's worth about twice what he paid for it now.

"Traditional cable television is dying.  Streaming video is the future and people are already embracing it.  I downgraded my Premium Plus Comcast package to Basic and have pretty much exclusively watched content via my little Roku device.   Netflix, Amazon Prime, NBA League Pass, Hulu Plus... there's rarely any reason to watch Comcast cable anymore.  And I always find their system extremely slow and painful to navigate.  Finding a movie through their obsolete ""On Demand"" system is just awful when compared to the ease-of-use of something like Netflix.  

Alas, none of that is possible without high speed internet... and that's where Comcast has me by the balls.  Once they fully succeed in their monopoly, they can begin enforcing their data cap and suddenly I'll be drowning in overage fees.  SO really there doesn't need to be a cable competitor.  We just need another option for high speed internet.   The gigabit internet thing sounded promising, because it was faster, didn't have data caps and was reasonably priced.   

If you look at how we are consuming media... it's completely going towards streaming video.  You don't need a cable box anymore.  We can access these apps on our iOS device, android, playstation, xbox, wii, roku, smart tv, apple tv, chromecast, laptop, pc, etc...   I've been saying for a while that two things could bring Comcast to it's knees.  #1 - If HBO starts allowing you to pay for HBO GO without a cable subscription.  #2 - If we had a high speed internet alternative.    If both of those things were to happen, I think Comcast/Time Warner would begin to die without innovation.

A couple roommates who, through a contract took on responsbilities of the landlord, tried to screw me earlier this year on something similar. They weren't smart enough to send me my deposit and itemized list within 14 days, though, so I sent them a request to pay me or I would take them to court and fight for as much as I could get. They immediately complied and deposited the money into my bank account that day. 

If I were you, I'd send a very threatening letter via email and snail mail with links/copy to the law and hope that you scare him shitless into paying you back asap. Set a deadline for him to pay you back before you file a claim. Ideally, you avoid court altogether.

"&gt; It's not about deterring crime, it's based on a moral imperative

I disagree.  I don't give a dang about ""morals"" and ""just punishment"" in our corrections system.  I want a corrections system that will deter crime so that it doesn't happen in the first place.  Many countries without the death penalty have found other ways to deter crime.

&gt; It costs peanuts in the overall scheme of the state budget

And given our state budget system right now we could sure use those peanuts.  Also, think about how many school lunches (just for an example) could be bought for the cost of one set of appeals.  I think that is a far better use of money than making sure someone dies.

&gt; Until recently most convictions have been based on unreliable witness testimony. The advent of modern technologies significantly reduces false convictions, and creates cases where there is truly 0 doubt.

Until we reach a society with absolutely zero false convictions (which we haven't), I am against it.

&gt; Personally I think gay marriage is barbaric and the mark of a culture not smart enough to acknowledge the facts of biology over emotions, but I recognize I have no right to push my personal feelings onto the rest of the state and voted for it.

And I expressed my opinion here just as you did in voting against gay marriage (and, in my opinion, on the same side of history as segregationists, but that is not the debate we are having right now).  And just as Inslee did with his actions today.  He is merely suspending executions (which, given our death row system, would not likely have happened all too soon anyway) while he tries to get the state legislature to abolish the death penalty.

Second, which of course leads to, why does this HAVE to be a jewish outfit? Because of a big nose? Is that really what we are basing all of this on? I think if he was purposefully being jewish there would be more to it, hence the first paragraph.

Third however, is what was he supposed to be? Who would go to a costume party with ""random items""? That is where the ammo for the argument comes from and it seems pretty dumb on his part.

It's actually hallucinatory-feeling for me. Sure, it's not actually a copy of LA but there are so, so many landmarks it freaks me out. Like ""hey, look, now we're in East LA. Now we're in Brentwood. Hey, there's Laurel Canyon and Hollywood Hills. Check it out! Victorville! And Griffith Park!""

"You are missing the point completely. You're not just paying for someone to remove your trash from your house, it has to go somewhere else after it gets put in the truck.

This is what you're paying for:

&gt;Seattle’s remaining garbage—the part that residents don’t sort into containers for organic and recyclable waste—amounts to about 438,000 tons a year. This is trucked to a Union Pacific rail yard south of downtown Seattle. Seven days a week, trucks line up to transfer their loads to railcars—5-ton metal containers that hold 25 tons of trash or more.

&gt;Six days a week, the 60 or so railcars of Seattle trash are joined by trash trucked in from Bellingham, Marysville and Auburn. When the train hits 110 cars or so, usually around 3:30 in the afternoon, it’s ready to head out.


&gt;The garbage train snakes 600 miles south and east, the rails following Interstate 5. After changing crews in north Portland, the train follows I-84 along the southern bank of the Columbia River, past The Dalles, out to the tiny town of Arlington, Oregon, population about 500. There a rail spur turns inland, and after winding 11 miles through rocky, barely arable pastureland the train arrives early the next morning at WMI’s 17-year-old, 700-acre landfill.

&gt; Maybe people get brave about using guns when they hear about other people using guns.

And of course you typed that in the context of explaining why homicide statistics would clump together, thus equating ""using guns"" with homicide.

Surely you weren't accusing ""other"" people of being less responsible than you, or more susceptible to homicidal impulses.

In heavy traffic I tend to leave a big space ahead and to generally accelerate and slow down slower than on surface streets, to keep my speed more even. It's amazing how just doing that will almost always result in an improvement to the traffic flow.

"Dude, I live in the U-District, less than four blocks from where this shooting took place. 

Is the Ave dirty, and infested with crusties and other lowlifes? Sure. But I've lived here for over a decade, and regularly walk over to the Safeway on Brooklyn, or to get take-out food late at night. I go to movies, or shows at the Neptune, or get off buses at 45th and University and walk the nine blocks home.

I even used to go pick up my mail from my PO box after midnight--descending into that decrepit subterranean shithole that is the U-District post office, where there was always someone sleeping way down at the far end. The only reason I don't still do that is because the lobby's now closed overnight. 

Sure, I think twice about going out as the bars are closing, or on major drunk holidays, but that's because I'd rather not get hit by a drunk driver while crossing the street. I've had a couple of close calls, so that's a reasonable precaution. And of course, when I do go out I maintain situational awareness; I don't wear headphones, and keep my phone in my pocket, and pay attention to my surroundings. 

So in the decade I've lived here, I've never had a run-in with anyone beyond a few harsh words (and even those have been rare). Body armor? A weapon? LOL. Yeah, I guess if you live in fear all the time you might *need* those, but I honestly don't. 

Oh, hey, and I'm a woman, too.

"The fact is that smoke is obnoxious, regardless of the source. Some smokes can be harmful. And a lot of smokers, though not all and not just weed, seem to think there is nothing wrong with incidental smoke exposure. But they are looking at it from the perspective of them being the only one providing smoke exposure. But we live/work/play in a city, where there are plenty of smokers. Incidental smoke exposure is a lot more frequent than just one guy on the corner of 3rd &amp; Pine. What might be a mild nuisance is magnified by the size and density of population. This mild nuisance becomes a much bigger problem. And at the end of the day, since smoking is an option, we make laws to stop a small problem from becoming a big problem. 

When a smoker ignores those laws they are putting themselves before an entire city/culture/society/what-have-you. That is selfish and annoying. Hence, people lash out. Made all the better by many smokers going ""What, its not that bad"". If it was just that smoker, maybe it wouldn't. But it never is just one smoker.

""There were three posts removed by me. One was witch hunting, one was basically looking for another venue for the wedding, the third was to promote the fb group about similar people in the same boat.

We don't allow witch hunting in this subreddit. We don't allow posts asking to rent space in this subreddit, that is /r/sealist. We also don't allow posts where most of the intention is to promote something (rule #6, applies to projects that a person is a fan of)""


These are pretty absurd interpretations of the rules.  1) My post was asking for information from the local community who can help us and other victims get back what they lost.  If r/Seattle isn't the place where we look for community help, there's no point in being here.  My post had also asked about options for venues/spaces, which brings us to 2) GOD FORBID WE ASK OTHER SEATTLE RESIDENTS WHERE THEY HAD THEIR WEDDINGS/WHAT THEIR EXPERIENCES WERE LIKE.  Moving that to r/Sealist is ridiculous.  We're not trying to rent a fucking apartment, we're asking for community opinions on a one time venue.  Good lord.  3)  What in god's green earth was being promoted?  All 3 of the posts had to do with restitution, change of space advice and media outreach.  r/Seattle is the perfect place for that.  Nobody was trying to extoll the values of their personal business publicly, and anyway private messages solve this fantasy issue.

"Stuff like this is reality for cops. It's an every single day potential outcome. A lot of their training and such revolves around identifying these situations and avoiding dying in the process. 

Cops have no duty be it legal or ethical to die for abstract legal principle. No more than you or I do. Thus they have the absolute right to go home each day with their life and limbs intact just the same as you and I do. 

Nothing above is objectionable. Cops are humans and humans are afforded the right to safety and security of their persons. 

The sketchy part is when cops start prioritizing their safety over others. Situations like this serve as teaching moments to cops. It shapes their personality and mandates heavily. 

An asshole pulls a gun and tries to kill some people just trying to make sure he paid his way like everyone else. What a horrible situation, no? Horrible situation definitely. However the ramifications are huge for cops. Now all the sudden everyone who skips out on a few bucks is potentially a killer. 

This is how cops are conditioned to assume everyone they interact with is a potential threat. We can bemoan the 'militarization' of cops all we want. The process of teaching cops all people are potentially violent, armed and with priors is already in motion and a reaction on the part of police to seeing officers die. 

Whose fault is it then?  The officers for being highly aggressive towards potential criminals and putting their own safety first? The public for mandating the officers perform a duty that puts their safety at odds with our interest? The criminals who see violence as a tool? Or the society that ensures that crime pays? 

Criminals aren't made over night. They're made in broken homes. They're made in schools that don't perform. They're made in foster homes that are abysmally low quality. They're made every time a real job is harder work and pays less than crime.

Then again, there are some who really need more practice - or a different vocation. I want to just ask them to play somewhere else to practice until they get better, but it would be rude and insulting to them... and I don't want to stifle their enthusiasm. I love music.

"A helpful excerpt about orphaned baby squirrels from http://www.squirrels.org/raising.html - good luck!!

We as humans often find this apparently helpless little creature on the ground and instinctively want to help. It is sometimes better to wait and watch up to several hours, to see if the mother returns, and let her correct this situation. If this doesn't happen, or there are other life threatening circumstances, it may be acceptable to intervene. 

It is very important to examine the baby for injuries, if the animal is bleeding or appears distressed in any way you should get a professional medical opinion before you proceed. As you could be doing more harm then good. 

The first thing is to determine if the baby is dehydrated. Check the mouth and nose for dryness. Look for dry, red, or tacky mucous membranes. Next, check for skin pliability. This can be done by gently pinching the skin on the infant's back, and raising it slightly. If the skin remains in a ""tented"" fashion for more that a second or two, the animal is likely dehydrated. 

Prior to any treatment, the baby squirrel's body must be warmed to at least 98 degrees Fahrenheit.  Wrapping the baby in a warmed towel for several minutes can do this.

To reintroduce fluids, use a 1cc syringe filled with warmed ""Pedialyte"" this is a hydrating fluid for human babies. It should be available in any drug store. An alternative fluid would be ""Gatorade"". Be sure it is warmed to body temperature before you start feeding. You should allow the baby to set the pace of sucking. This takes a little practice, just remember slower is better. Follow the feeding chart below, and recheck every four hours or so, for signs of improvement. Hydrating should last no more than 24 hours. 

Next, what to feed your new arrival. A formula of powdered ""Esbilac"" mixed with water is the recommended choice. Esbilac is a milk replacement for puppies. It can be purchased at most pet supply stores; you should also pick up a 3cc syringe for a newborn or a 10cc. syringe for squirrels four weeks and older. Esbilac comes in powder form and also premixed liquid. If you are feeding one squirrel, get the smallest size can. Naturally the powder will keep longer then the liquid form. But you can prolong the life of both by pouring the mixed formula into an ice cube tray and freezing. This gives you about sixteen one-ounce doses, which you can then defrost and warm in the Microwave oven. This method is helpful if you have a lot of mouths to feed. 

The basic formula should consist of 1 cup of water, 1/2 cup of powder Esbilac, and 1/2 cup of whipping cream. The cream is added to fortify the formula, and add a little extra incentive to eat. An alternative small batch mixture would be 2-tsp water, 1 tsp Esbilac, and 1 tsp of whipping cream. You'll have less waste with this teaspoon method.

"In my analogy, the gun shooter is the driver, not the cyclist. The cyclist isn't the one who caused someone's death in this case.

I do agree that jail isn't always warranted in cases where a car hits a cyclist. The problem is that there is more or less *no* penalty at all for killing someone with your car. There have been cases where it's pretty clear that it *was* an intentional homicide, and still nothing has happened to the driver.

Even if, in this case, there is reason to believe that it was a total accident, do you really feel that a $175 fine is sufficient? I'm guessing that's about the same amount you pay for speeding a tiny bit, or parking in a place where it is disallowed to do so. If nothing else, any driver who kills someone should be required to have their driving skills re-evaluated, and should pay a hefty fine. And if there is any indication that they intended to harm the victim (which I agree that there isn't, in this case) they should face murder charges exactly the same as if they had intended to harm someone with a gun or knife or bomb, not some lame ""following too closely"" or ""reckless driving"" charge.",false,true,t1_cicpasi,VividLotus,,0,1403290497,t5_2qhad,t3_28j4gj,t1_cicp163,2,1434327825,0,0,cicpasi,Seattle,2,,,

"Visa and Mastercard have always allowed merchants to offer discounts for cash purchases. They have never allowed additional surcharges due to paying by card. It seems like the same thing, but the former was allowed, and the latter was disallowed, by both Visa and Mastercard.

[Here](http://consumerist.com/2006/04/20/mega-update-requiring-minimum-credit-card-purchases-is-a-violation/) is a Consumerist article from 2006 containing the 2006 versions of both merchant agreements. Ctrl+F for ""discount"" and you'll find the relevant passages from both agreements.

This part of the agreement, regarding discounts for cash, was exactly the same last I checked (in 2013).

edit: [Here](http://www.mastercard.us/merchants/support/surcharge-rules.html) are Mastercard's changes in surcharge policy. Short version: You can surcharge a credit card, not a debit card, and the cap is equal to the amount paid in interchange (max: 4%, see very bottom). Which means a flat rate surcharge is going to result in violations if the purchase amount is low. The amount of the surcharge must be clearly displayed throughout the store, and immediately beside the register.

This means, if you charge a 60 cents for a 2.30 purchase done with a _debit_ card, while having no signage whatsoever regarding the surcharge, you're not only violating the agreement, but you're doing it in extraordinary fashion (cough ABYSSINIA MARKET).",false,true,t1_cfcv5hd,dieselmachine,Green Lake,0,1392153568,t5_2qhad,t3_1xkg75,t1_cfcunmz,4,1432354624,0,0,cfcv5hd,Seattle,4,,flair,

She said that as the council considers how to regulate companies like Lyft and Uber, its central focus should be looking out for “working people” who drive taxis, flat-rate cars and rideshare vehicles. Sawant also noted that financial corporations like Goldman Sachs back rideshare companies. “We're not talking about a level playing field,” she said. 

She sees the rideshares as vehicles for whatever her socialist movement is trying to fight.

A rideshare system obviously precludes the demand to do what she wants.

Basically, she is trying to protect the drivers of the existing regulated system as well as seeing the rideshare system as an instrument of whatever boogeyman she thinks she needs to fight. Regulated and organized labor under the existing system, however, is her good guy.

"Hi there!

So I actually went through the program you're talking about. I was in their Python 8-week intensive course from February through April. I had no prior programming experience and little computer experience outside of building my own gaming rig.

When talking about these courses, a lot of people think purely about the programming skills they'll gain. To be honest, you'll come out capable, if very inexperienced. That's where the rest of their curriculum kicks in. CF strongly stresses  'soft skills.' Writing resumes, interviewing, networking, etc. They have a mentoring program in place that help graduates connect with a mentor in a partner company. I credit that for finding my job after graduation. I asked my mentor a lot of veyr technical questions, beyond the scope of his experience, and he in turn introduced me to someone who could answer them. That second contact ended up offering me a coding challenge and in turn a job. 

Will it work for everyone? I doubt it. Everyone learns differently. I enjoy diving into the deep end and constantly challenging myself. My most successful classmates are similar in that thinking or had a much firmer base in CS. Which also leads to the next thought. My teacher made it clear that he was teaching us to be developers who knew python, not python developers. The stack you know isn't important when you don't know how to apply the bigger concepts. For example, I work in a ruby house, despite only having had experience in python. I've picked up what I've needed quickly since then.

So I heartily recommend CF if you're the drink from the firehose type. Feel free to hit me with questions if you want.",false,true,t1_cjiupof,Grafvonsheep,,0,1407358140,t5_2qhad,t3_2ctclk,t3_2ctclk,6,1435458341,0,0,cjiupof,Seattle,6,,,

Yes. What the city needs to do is entice developers to create affordable housing.

"If the new construction was coming in at a price equal to what it is displacing then it would keep prices from rising as fast.  But it's coming in at the upper tiers of the rental market which is pulling up the cost of the lower tiers.   Supply and demand is at work, but the supply of affordable housing is diminishing with every new ""market rate"" apartment building that is going up.   And as the supply of affordable housing diminishes, the price of that housing increases.  

The new construction that is required by density would reduce the increase in housing costs if it was aimed squarely at increasing supply for affordable housing products, but since it is increasing supply for an entirely different product at the expense of the more affordable product it raises prices across the board.   And the city's idea to increase the cost of construction even more with fees to pay for affordable housing is going to make the prices go up even more.

I think the only time that increased density has a downward effect on the market is when the bottom drops out of it and there is far more housing than potential tenants.

"There is a lot of smugness in this thread. I respect people's decisions to abstain from drug use, but taking a ""holier-than-thou"" approach only dehumanizes people. Hundreds of thousands of people in the US take these drugs every year. At raves, clubs, bars, house parties... Telling people not to take them isn't working. These drugs have been illegal for 30 years. Jail time isn't scaring anyone, and unkind, smug words won't either. All these attitudes do is allow people to dismiss these issues without putting any real thought into them. 

Treating people who take drugs as deserving to go the hospital, or die, as if they are asking for it, is just stupid. In most cases they are asking for molly. They want, and think they are taking, mdma. But because there is no regulation, no way to actually confirm what you have is mdma, they end up buying something else. 

Yes, if they chose to partake in this risky behavior, some fault should lie with them. But is a legal system that forces people to buy from black market drug dealers instead of a safe source, and then sweeps everyone who does so under the rug, also at fault? If instead of turning a blind eye to this activity, what if we accepted it as something that is going to happen, and then tried to reduce the harm as much as possible?

&gt;The cost of operating SkyTrain in 2008, with an estimated 73.5 million boardings, was $83 million. [*[citation needed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*]   To cover this, TransLink draws mostly from transit fares, advertising ($360 million in 2008) and tax ($262 million from fuel taxes and $298 million from property taxes in 2008), funds which are also shared with bus services, roads and bridge maintenance, and other infrastructure and services. [*[citation needed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*]  The capital costs of building the system are shared with other government agencies. Capital expenses were $216 million [*[citation needed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*]  in 2008. For example, the cost of building the Canada Line was shared between TransLink ($335 million or 22 percent), the federal government (29 percent), the provincial government (28 percent), the airport authority (19 percent), and the City of Vancouver (2 percent).  While TransLink has run surpluses for operating costs since 2001,   it incurs debt to cover these capital costs. As a whole, TransLink has $1.1 billion in long-term debt, as of 2006, of which $508 million was downloaded from the province during the 1999 transfer of responsibility for SkyTrain.   As the province retained ownership of the causeway, bridge, and certain services, it retained a portion of SkyTrain's debt as well.

"&gt; Does that result in most new housing being marketed as condos instead of apartments?

I think the rent control laws definitely contribute to the fact that it's generally more profitable to build/sell condos instead of rental housing (although that might be a chicken-vs-egg scenario, if condo prices weren't so high they would be much less profitable and you might see more rental construction). 

There's plenty of indication that rental supply has been insufficient since Vancouver's vacancy rate usually hovers around 0.9-2%, much less than Seattle's, but on the other hand rental prices have also never seen the kind of spikes Seattle has gotten recently, and it's my opinion that BC's rent controls are part of the reason for that. I do however think the large number of investors in the market do contribute to rental supply by renting out their investment condos for income (although many are left vacant) so condo development does help a fair bit with rental supply even if they aren't built or marketed as rentals.

I think what Seattle is seeing that Vancouver doesn't really see is wealthier newcomers displacing existing tenants, because that's pretty much illegal in Vancouver. So there's less incentive to create new housing to meet demand and more incentive to displace existing tenants with large rent increases.

"I have once considered moving from Seattle (where I worked at Microsoft) to Silicon Valley. I went there and interviewed at a bunch of startups. Of course, the interviews are both ways, so I asked a bunch of people in many startups where they worked before the current place. The responses  went like this: ""I worked at P, and it folded, so I moved to Q, and it was sold, then to R, which also folded, then to S, T, U, and V, which all either sold or folded"".

In the end I've met literally dozens of people most (all) of who worked for 10+ years as software developers and left absolutely no impact. This was actually quite depressing. I ended up at Google that year, but in Seattle office, where I learned that a half life or GOOG developer is approximately 2.5 years - more in places outside SV, less in SV itself.

So that's that - never looked at startups again. Yes, one or two of them per decade are wildly successful, but most of them these days are designed from the ground up to sell to a bigger fool. Even if the bigger fool is found, there's still this question of impact on human civilization, and there's basically none even in plans.

Another thing - the biggest career growth anywhere is in finding a path from "".NET developer"" to ""Software Engineer"" :-).

However, I don't think any attractive North American city is building fast enough to satisfy demand for close-in housing.  Some of Seattle's west coast competitors are building far more slowly and have far more political barriers to construction, especially the SF Bay Area.  ""Close-in housing in a hip urban area"" is essentially a product that the market cannot satisfy in the same way it can demand for smartphones or bicycles, mainly because too many political barriers stand in the way that don't affect a factory that cranks out millions of widgets.  I'd like to see the housing market operate more like the smartphone market, whereby it can quickly adapt to new demand, although I know it won't, because established home owners will always try to leverage political power to prevent their cityscape from changing.

"&gt;We all know the truck hit the pedestrian (obvious), but what was the driver doing to not operate the truck safely (speeding, no turn signal, known blind spots, known mechanical issues, etc.)

Failed to check a crosswalk for pedestrians.  Failure of the basic duty to operate the vehicle safely.  Even if he signaled and was driving the speed limit, the fact that the driver hit a pedestrian who was walking inside a crosswalk with a walk signal is enough to show that the driver was not operating the vehicle safely.  Other failures would just be additional evidence, but would not be necessary.

&gt;did the driver honk or otherwise attempt to attract the attention of the pedestrian?

So the driver sees a pedestrian in the cross walk and, instead of stopping to allow the pedestrian to cross safely, honks the horn and then continues through the crosswalk and then another 100 feet before stopping?  Really?  That sounds even more egregious.  Or maybe you think trucks just routinely honk instead of checking for pedestrians that are directly in front of them.  This wasn't a truck backing up, in which case I might see where you are going with this.

&gt;did the pedestrian or the driver have on headphones?

Not really relevant, unless were going with your honking hypo.  Her injuries were a result of the truck driving in an unexpected way, not from the truck coming at her from a blind spot.  The truck was coming from in front of her.  The problem is that by the time it is clear that the truck is not going to stop, it is too late.  Also, since we not tell deaf people that it is negligent to cross the street, this is even more unimportant.

&gt;was either the pedestrian or the driver distracted by an electronic device (phone, GPS, music player, etc)?

You can clearly see that the victim's arms are both at her side as she is crossing the street.

&gt;did the driver see the pedestrian and knowingly proceed in the intended path?

If yes, more evidence of the driver being solely at fault.  If not, does not diminish the driver's fault.

&gt;did either see the other and make the judgement that the other would change course?

Huh?  If the driver made that assumption, it goes to his own fault, as he was legally required to yield.  The victim clearly did see the truck, but it was too late.  If you are referring to her seeing the truck as it was further down the street, what would she have done with that information?  What would you have done?  Everyone is taught from an early age that the safe way to cross a street is with the walk signal and to do it quickly but without running.  The safe and proper thing for a pedestrian to do is to just continue walking and to get out of the street.  There are always going to be cars approaching the crosswalk as you are in it.  Are you going to assume every one of those cars is going to be negligent and just sprint across the street?  That action would actually make the pedestrian more negligent.

&gt;were either involved tested for drug or alcohol impairment?

We do not know this.  It would certainly go to the driver's fault.  It is extremely unlikely that it would affect the victim's fault, and her actual actions were completely reasonable.

"Hi just_add_coffee, thanks for your message!

 I agree with you that we need to make it very hard for criminals and psychos like Adam Landa to get access to a gun. The problem that gun owners have with legislation like 594 and AWBs and so on is that its written by people that don't really know very much about guns or the process of buying a gun, so they write it in ways that end up curtailing law-abiding citizens but not criminals. I could parrot the NRA talking points and stats that prove this, but if you care, its a simple google search away. If you'd like to talk more about it, let me know, I'm glad to talk about what you disagree with, though!

Thanks for the vote of confidence in my post. I get really annoyed with a lot of gun owners because they don't know how to relate and make friends, like omnifox does. A lot of guys fit the stereotype and think just yelling ""Second amendment! 1776!"" proves them right, but I think we're starting to see more and more younger guys who are more in touch with reality getting into the sport, which is good for everyone involved. Before the current post, I wanted to actually make my own thread about 594 which would have been a fair and reasoned discussion, but onmifox beat me to it and I think left a really bad taste in everyone's mouth.

Anyhow, again, yes, this hurts collectors the most...we end up buying the most guns, and we usually have federal licenses to do it (FFL03 - http://nyfirearms.com/forums/curios-relics/51600-03-c-r-ffl-information-thread-faq.html), which require a background check and logging all the guns we buy with the license. 594 will ignore that we have this and make us go through a dealer. Unfortunately, I've learned yesterday that a lot of dealers are supporting 594 because they'll be able to squeeze money out of people buying guns privately.

Thank you for thinking about 594 critically, and I encourage you to let me know if you need more info to make up your mind, as well as asking everyone you know to think hard about it too. At the surface, it seems like a good idea, which is why I'm trying to get as many people I know to think about it before just bubbling yes. If you're curious, 594 was introduced to the legislature and failed (HB1588, 2013-2014) so its sponsors are hoping the common voter would think about this less than the legislators do, but knowing its faults, I'm confident people will vote correctly.

Though to be honest, I would be fine with 594 if it only had an exemption for CPL holders (requires a background check every 5 years, most private sellers typically require a buyer to have one in WA) and for FFL03s (requires a background check every 3 years), as well as allowing a temporary loan while in proximity to the owner, but without that, its terrible.

Again, thanks for messaging me back, and the offers always open if you want to learn to shoot or get hands-on experience with firearms (at least while its still legal to do so).",false,true,t1_cjzgl4p,ampersand20,,0,1408919670,t5_2qhad,t3_2eakkj,t1_cjz3m4d,3,1427376228,0,0,cjzgl4p,Seattle,3,,,

&gt;A __self-fulfilling prophecy__ is a prediction that directly or indirectly causes itself to become true, by the very terms of the prophecy itself, due to [positive feedback](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_feedback) between belief and behavior. Although examples of such [prophecies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophecy) can be found in literature as far back as [ancient Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greece) and [ancient India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_India), it is 20th-century [sociologist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociologist) [Robert K. Merton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_K._Merton) who is credited with coining the expression ""self-fulfilling prophecy"" and formalizing its structure and consequences. In his 1948 article *Self-Fulfilling Prophecy*, Merton defines it in the following terms:

"The article buried the lede, which is ""We in the PNW need to plan and be prepared for a M9.0-ish megaquake.  We don't know when it will come, but when it does it will break a lot of stuff for a long time.""


~~The article even~~ **Recent geological research** states that **normal distribution of** Cascadia megaquakes have come every ~~400-~~600 years **on average, with a standard deviation of 180 years** (even though the graphic states 500-600). ~~, which means we're 85 years away from the documented low bound of the cycle period.~~  **So, depending on whether or not the unimodal or cluster model applies, USGS estimates the probability of a megaquake in the next 50 years at ~15% or ~30%, respectively.**

"&gt; They don't have to, nor is it Zen driving, but telling me that I am a jackass or other insults doesn't move the conversation forward.

That is not an answer to the question stated. He asked why you want them to, not if they have to. Then you brought up the fact that personal insults do not move the conversation forward. While that is true, it does nothing to answer this question. 

So I will ask in a way that is not so easily avoidable:

"Part of this is self-selection.  City biking can be rough, so the people who stick with it tend to be either very tough or a little crazy.  Being quiet and blending into the background can get you killed, so even people who are normally introverted are louder and more visible on a bike.  Add to that the adrenaline rush when a driver does something life-threatening and it's easy to be aggressive.   

When cycling advocates talk about wanting to be more like the Netherlands, part of what they mean is that they want an average mom to feel secure biking with her kids to school every morning.  In places with good infrastructure people tend to feel safer, and that goes a long way toward keeping everyone calm.

"The color is due to the presence of dust particles 1/10th of a micron or less in the atmosphere that break apart the incoming light. Due to different wavelengths, colors at the upper end of the spectrum will have a higher probability of scattering. By the time light reaches us, the violet is gone and blue is next which is what we see on the surface. Incidentally, water droplets are much larger than this which is why clouds appear white! They scatter all colors. 

Take a look at this [image](http://www.treks.org/meratop.jpg). You will see a purplish hue at that elevation, and a darker sky due to less particulate matter to scatter the light.

About your theory I suspect it'd be true, but in the opposite direction. If the atmosphere were thicker, then more colors would be scattered away and we would see a yellow/orange/red-ish sky. Having all other conditions controlled except for the size of the planet (and thus the proportioal thickness of the atmosphere,) then the sky will have a reddish hue instead of blue. You can observe this happening on earth when you view a [sunset](http://imgur.com/7n1VpHg). Because the Sun is near the horizon, sunlight has to travel through much more atmosphere to reach us and by then blue is scattered away and we see orange sunsets. Precisely why the sunsets are much more deep and beautiful during periods of wildfires that inject more particles into the air.

"I believe you and I will have to agree one of us misunderstands the other. I believe a corporation is a legal structure created so a group of people can operate together as a single entity in public spheres. I do not see a distinction between corporations incorporated for monetary gain, political alliance, or social recognition.

For the sake of argument, you may consider the definition, purpose, and meaning of a corporation as the majority of the Supreme Court defined it in the case we are discussing.

A relevant quote from Justice Kennedy (I bolded the part I think is important):
&gt;""If the First Amendment has any force, it prohibits Congress from fining or jailing citizens, or **associations of citizens**, for simply engaging in political speech.""

I believe you completely missed the point of my sales tax argument. As I've said at least twice, the sales tax discussion is irrelevant. In fact, to end your barrage of personal insults, I'll grant you every statement you've made so far about sales tax. For the sake of this argument, I am wrong about everything I've said about interstate sales tax. I am indeed the problem with Democracy.

Let's instead pull ourselves out of the weeds of tax history and play in the well mowed grass of political philosophy. As a principle, I believe I should not have to pay taxes or belong to any governments which will not allow me to have a say in how those taxes are used or collected. If my labor does not earn me a right to have a voice, what does? My personhood?

&gt; this isn't even a right to begin with


I predict if you have the courage to continue this conversation, we will find the wisdom hidden by our misunderstanding in the truths your statement hides. I believe I retain the right to do anything I want unless I've specifically given up that right. All rights are ""rights to begin with."" You imply you believe rights are something given to me by something else. I find no other way to interpret a world where some action ""isn't even a right to begin with.""

To restate: rights aren't given to citizens by a government, an agreement made by men long ago, or any other religious or historic tradition.

"Seattle Schools: [be aware that zoning is changing again](http://www.seattleschools.org/modules/cms/pages.phtml?sessionid=&amp;pageid=219198). 

There are some amazing schools in the city and some terrible ones.  Our house is zoned for an excellent elementary (changing with the rezone - but still excellent) and exellent middle school. However the HS is one of the ""problem"" schools of the district (Ingraham). Check out the various school ratings websites for parent comments.

Houses - the market is presumably just as competitive now as it was when we bought 6 months ago. We relied on redfin + our agent. Looked at 100's of places online and dozens in person. Put offers in on 3+ homes before getting one (pre-inspections are a thing here, you'll need to count on shelling out a few $100 each time you put an offer in on a place). A majority of the homes under $400k need work (at least the ones we stumbled upon). They had functional but dated interiors and/or needed mechanical/roofing work done (old electrical, old roof, old inefficient furnace). We ended up with a home sub $400k but it's smaller than you'd need and further north than you'd probably prefer.  In a good neighborhood a 4 bedroom home that doesn't reek of cat pee will probably run you at least $500 -$600k (again - check redfin to get an idea of what's available now / what recently sold).

Kirkland/Bellevue/Redmond - all good school districts. Home prices will be a little bit less, again search sold listings (1 month) with a 4 bedroom requirement on redfin to get an idea of prices (I believe the eastside is a little less expensive but still competitive).

I believe amazon gives out a bus pass to employees - so your husband could commute via bus (either from a transit center or a stop near your house).

"Having lived in other cities like SF and NY, a lot of what I like about Seattle, and Washington in general, is the lack of regulations and unnecessary restrictions. I think rent control would be an unfair restriction on real estate investors, the government shouldn't be able to limit how much someone can sell something for. I do believe the government and our laws should protect people though, especially tenants. Washington already has some pretty decent tenant laws, but perhaps they could require a longer notice on rent increases over a certain percentage. Something like that could help ease the burden of having to decide whether to pay the increased amount or find somewhere else to live. For example, add to the current tenant laws, a stipulation which says any rent increase greater than 20% would require 3-6 months notice.

If you get to the arena early enough I find the [Mercer St.](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Mercer+Street+Garage/@47.622685,-122.351284,16z/data=!4m5!1m2!2m1!1s5th+ave+parking+near+key+arena!3m1!1s0x0000000000000000:0xbff514d5e38921ca) garage to be a better option and easier to exit.   

As for food and drinks I would definitely suggest somewhere outside of the arena.  There are plenty of options close for food and drink depending on what you're in the mood to imbibe that night.  Key Arena has awful choices when it comes to concessions.  For a city with one of the best beer and mixed drink scenes your choices inside the venue are pretty much Coors or Pyramid (I think that is their ""craft"" beer option).  The food is standard crap.  Pizza, dry burgers, and fries.

As for seats, there really are great site lines in Key Arena.  It's not a bad venue to see a show but the acoustics are crap and even the best bands don't always sound up to snuff.  It's not necessarily the act but just the setup of the sound &amp; design of the building.  

I've seen a lot of events there &amp; it's a decent venue.  Just plan on getting most of your eating and drinking done beforehand and you'll have an awesome time.

There is a patchwork of services available for all kinds of specific situations, women, vets, people with HIV, mental illness, etc. It would be difficult, if not impossible for a mentally ill, drug addicted, or sick person to navigate the system and find what's available for their specific situation, which is why case management programs exist (or should exist, many, like the one my wife worked for, are being cut).

"&gt; It's like when you're applying to a job. You don't pull up your own background check, and give it to them. I've never really heard of such a thing. They do it on their side.

This is absolutely nothing like being hired for a job. But even using your example, employees are an investment. They pay for everything in the hiring process because that's what they need to do to be competitive with similar companies, and they will make more money by paying for the hiring process and paying an employee salary. In short, they make more than they spend. 

You're asking them to spend more than they would make. I hope some of 
my other replies help to illuminate that.

&gt; Or even when you apply for a credit card. Do they ask you to send them your credit history. No. They do it on their side.

Actually, as I described before, Car2Go approvals operate in almost an identical fashion to a credit card company, you are just mistaken about what that process is.

Both Car2Go and credit card companies pay a 3rd party provider to give them a score. Just a score, not a report. If you get denied, you get a generic email or letter giving you generic possible reasons for the denial. This is the reason why legislation was passed to allow consumers 1 free credit report a year, because it is the consumers responsibility to get their own credit report and do their own research.
. 
&gt; I've never really heard of such a thing. 

By your replies, I'm not surprised. They are incorrect or stemming from inexperience. Inexperience is okay, but you need to recognize that's the case and not get upset because you haven't come across an issue yet.

Maybe you've never paid for car insurance, but having an accident-- regardless of who's at fault--raises your prices because you are considered to be a greater risk to insure. Commercials talk about this. This has been common knowledge for decades. Because people who have one accident, even when they are not at fault, are more likely to have another accident than someone who has never had any.

Really, it's fortunate this happened to you. It is your responsibility to know what is on your own driving record, just like it's your responsibility to know what is on your credit report. You can easily get both, and you need to. Your driving record can affect your employment, insurance, renting a car, and using car services, and your credit report affects just about everything else. 

Keep in mind, the source of this problem is your low driving risk score, not Car2Go. **The smartest thing you can do is to find out the service provider who does their checks and see how you can go about providing them with the documentation necessary to have your score reflect that you weren't at fault in your accidents.** Because even if you fix the Car2Go situation, you'll still have this problem elsewhere.

&gt; I think it's some fairly basic level of service to provide to a customer. 

That's what they are doing. Their current model allows them to keep their prices lower and dedicate more resources to serving existing and potential customers. Your score is too low to fit in that category.

Edit: Proactive suggestion added.

"I'm from Dallas as well and a recent transplant also (4 months now), and whatever problems we have adjusting to city life is far overwhelmed by the natural beauty we encounter every day and the great time we had all summer.  The constant views of mountain and water are unlike anything we experienced living in Richardson, Lake Highlands, or the M-Streets.

I haven't made any friends here yet either, but I'm not too concerned.  I'm a little surprised since you said you guys move around a lot that you are not used to this situation.  We've moved around a lot too... It took us a good year in several different places (Singapore, Montreal, to name a few) to really make friends and get to know a couple people.

The obvious places to start making friends are through work and school (and we've met parents from the kids' schools as well, so that's another avenue for those with kids).  But unfailingly, the best avenue I've made friends around the world is through common activities.  In Singapore, it was softball... walking past a field at the university one day, saw some guys playing softball, joined them the next week and played with them weekly for the next two years, and now I have some lifelong friendships.  Same thing in Montreal... signed up for an amateur baseball league as a free agent, got placed on a team, played there for only one year, but made some of the best friends a guy could have.

So basically, I'm just saying what pretty much everyone else is saying in this thread... get out there and do things you enjoy, and you're bound to interact with people that have similar interests... it's only a matter of time and effort.

One thing I will disagree with one of the posters in this thread is, whatever you do, don't start rooting for the Mariners!  Go Rangers!

EDIT: forgot to mention, if you're trying to get away from derelicts, noise, traffic, as others mention, try to get away from the densest parts of the city.

"I know this isn't a popular opinion, but I used to work at Walmart and it is my 2nd highest paying job I've ever had. I lived in a state with low cost of living and made $10/hour there when minimum wage was $7.35. (Not great, but I was 18 years old.) When I worked at Target a year earlier, I made minimum wage. With Walmart I had health insurance (not great, but better than nothing and it wasn't required then), paid vacation and sick time, and a decent employee stock purchase plan. I also worked at a high volume store and we got $400 bonuses every quarter we outperformed our sales goals. 

The cost of buying stuff there was cheaper than anywhere else too. 

So for that level of labor it is a decent wage, and they aren't ripping off consumers with their prices. I don't see a problem with that. Yeah, it sucks for other businesses competing with Walmart, but I'm not a business, I'm a consumer. Businesses don't seem to care about me and my problems, so why should I stick up for businesses who are having trouble competing with Walmart?

Get to know your gear, practice riding in groups to get used to being around a LOT of other riders.  Learn the etiquette as well.

"Ok, I did it anyway. I found [this document](http://dor.wa.gov/docs/reports/Local_Retail_Sales/allq413.pdf) listing sales tax revenue per city: Seattle is very roughly one third of the county revenue base ($4.5billion of taxable sales out of ~$11 billion). Bellevue is about $1.5billion and Issaquah is not much at all, 300 million. 

I think that [this document](http://www.k12.wa.us/safs/pub/fin/0405/0405%20pdf%20reports/sdallfndc.pdf) is saying that Issaquah got $165 million in funding in 2004, and Seattle got $550 million. So Seattle raised 40% of the sales tax and received 20% of the school funding, and Issaquah raised 2.5% of the county sales tax and received 6% of the school funding. Bellevue on the other hand received 7.5% of school funding and raised 12% of sales taxes, so my conclusion is that Issaquah is being subsidized but Bellevue isn't.

I don't know if property taxes would follow this breakdown or not, but it's hard to see the other cities paying enough property tax to make up that shortfall - don't forget that Issaquah is *tiny* compared to Seattle, maybe 40,000 people?

Also, there is nothing stopping these cabbies from signing up and becoming a ride-share driver in order to compete with the market.

In Canada, in order to get approved for an immigrant work visa, one must be a skilled worker immigrating to Canada to perform a job which the Canadian work force can not fill themselves.

"I'm seeing a lot of similar questions here about this stop. As a regular user of the existing 520 freeway stops @ Evergreen &amp; Yarrow points, let me break it down: 

* This stop is used heavily during the morning and evening commute by folks transferring between express buses and local buses which serve their origin/destination on either side of the lake. For example, if you lived in Bridle Trails and attended UW, you'd take the 265 to Evergreen Point then transfer to the 542.
* This stop is heavily used by bicyclists. It's the first/last stop on the east side of the 520 bridge, on which pedestrians and cyclists are not allowed. Metro offers a free ride between Evergreen Point and Montlake on deadheading buses (and most drivers will let you ride across the bridge for free from the last stop on one side to the first stop on the other)
* There's a park and ride at this stop primarily used by Eastside residents. It's pretty small and it fills up early, but it keeps at least 50 cars off the roads in Seattle on any given weekday. The capacity of this P&amp;R is being increased as a part of the Eastside 520 corridor project.
* Eventually, there will be an HOV/Transit lane on the inside of 520. This will be a major improvement from the old HOV/Transit lane which was on the outside of the highway. It will also connect in with the HOV lanes on the new 520 bridge.
* Both the Evergreen Point and Yarrow Point freeway stops open in late June :)

"The minimum wage is a complicated policy, and there's a lot of debate on what exactly the benefits and drawbacks are. But if the goal is basically to give more money to poorer folks, a minimum wage seems like a pretty bad way to do it:

* Workers can be substituted for machines. It's not something that happens overnight, but the more you pay your existing workers, the more you'll want to invest in tools to make those workers more productive, rather than just hiring more people.
* Workers can be substituted for other workers. At $15/hr, you're competing with other workers who have decent experience and skills. I might be willing to take a risk on a high school dropout employee if it saves me money, but if I have to pay a high wage, I'm going to hire the 30-something guy with a job history.
* Workers are the people who already have jobs. You're automatically excluding the poorest people, who don't have jobs.

It's hard to say how big those drawbacks are without actually raising the minimum and seeing what happens, but my question is, why would you want a policy with those drawbacks? If you want to do a transfer, why not just do a transfer?

I wonder how many thugs who get their firearms on the black market will be following this law?

Anyway to answer your loaded and biased question,  Section 2 paragraph 25 states:

""(25) Transfer"" means the intended delivery of a firearm to another person without consideration of payment or promise of payment including, but not limited to, gifts and loans.""

This would prevent a father giving a firearm to his son, which is legal under federal law. More troubleing, it would mean that if a pair of friends were at a shooting range and one friend tried out the others new Glock they are now both felons. Furthermore it would prevent gun safety training because you could no longer be in possession of a gun that belonged to someone else. 

Not to mention that this is impossible to enforce. How does one track the sale  the firearms already in the hands of people? This bill is a step towards registration.

"As someone who has been in a related but somewhat different situation, experiencing different people and/or other cultures is really the only way to get your head on straight.  I grew up in a fundamentalist Southern Baptist environment.  I went to church every Sunday and some Wednesdays, and participated in youth camps in the summer.  I went to a private Baptist school that was headed by a man that could only be described as an extremist, although my parents were only moderately active in the church.  By the time I graduated high school at 17 years old, not only did I fear anyone who participated in any other religion (including literally every other Christian sect), it was also my sincere hope and belief that one day God would purge us of the homosexual plague as he did at Sodom and Gomorrah and send them all screaming into hell, and if he also got all of the sinful interracial relationships, that would have been pretty dandy.  That also came along with all of the other trappings of Southern Baptist teachings, including Bible literalism, the suspicion that scientists were direct mouthpieces of the forces of evil, women were to obediently and unquestioningly follow their husbands, and so on.  It may sound insane to people who haven't experienced this kind of intense religious culture, but that's what I genuinely believed as I had no sense of anything outside of my upbringing.  I feel confident in saying that you and I both know very well how faith can become your internal reality and blind you to the external reality in the process.  

Once I got out into the world a little bit, specifically going to college and getting my first job, it began to radically change my perspective.  I didn't even have to leave my town for this big perspective shift; in fact, to this day I've never set foot outside the southeast (much to my chagrin, but that's a different subject).

I met my first Catholic (one of my supervisors at my first job) and she was quite nice for a hell-bound idol worshiper.  She didn't seem like a bad person, and that shocked me.  There were other coworkers who held other religious beliefs there, too, and none of them seemed even slightly evil.  It took several years for me to really grasp how much arrogance, ignorance, and hate I was harboring.

My advice (that I know you didn't ask for, but I'm giving it anyway) is to take that energy that you were pouring into your faith and pour it into something objectively positive.  Volunteer somewhere, help someone out.  Learn about other people.  Enroll in a few university courses and expand your horizons some.  And while you're doing all of that, you need to think about your relationship with both religion and with God and really re-evaluate it, just like an alcoholic has to re-evaluate his relationship with booze.

For a breakdown, I'm using [this report](http://www.seattle.gov/DPD/cityplanning/populationdemographics/aboutseattle/neighborhoods/default.htm) that estimates the number of employed people per neighborhood/urban village:

Total Employment City Wide: 499,946

Commercial Core: 94,742

Belltown: 18,298

Denny Triangle: 19,097

Pioneer Square: 12,177

Uptown: 14,072

MLK was with prostitutes, yes. But, as far as I know, he never advocated the continuation of prostitution or slavery of women.

"&gt;So, the picture I'm getting is that everything is just fine, no problem to see here. Everybody just keep buying guns, it'll make us safer!

The problem sets you are dealing with are not a result of the 2nd amendment, they are rooted deeply in social and economic policies that cause a cycle of violence. A gun does not make you safer, it gives you a chance to equalize a situation if it is necessary and possible to do so.

&gt;The barista at cafe racer would have been alive if 2/3 of the patrons had been carrying, arm up a sandy hook elementary teacher.

Maybe, maybe not. You're trying to put words into people's mouths. Everything is situational, I've already said that nothing happens in a vacuum. Cafe Racer was a matter of seconds, Sandy Hook was minutes. Being armed doesn't help if you don't have the opportunity to draw your weapon before being shot. Could an armed teacher have saved their students at Sandy Hook? Very likely.

&gt; Its actually those draconian regulations that caused that shooting in Santa Barbara. Police states like Australia are slaughterhouses because guns were taken away from law abiding citizens.

This is implying that I said that those laws were the causation of violence. Rather, those laws do nothing to stop violence like they are intended for. 

&gt; I still think you are hoping for a hollywood ending to the problems of crime, violence, economic inequality and racism; that the good guys will shoot their way to a better world.

Based on what, other than your preconceived notion of what you think the cookie-cutter NRA talking points are? 

&gt;You and your concealed carry buddies are hopping to meet someone someday you can kill and be vindicated for it. All the constitutional justification, all the gun lobby apologies, all the crime stat citations, just a cover for a death wish.

And here is where your true feelings are finally shared. A statement based in nothing but emotion and irrationality. I'm not going to spill my guts about killing to you, but it is not a fun activity. You do it to preserve your own life and the lives of your brothers.

"I do some K-8 programming teaching.  To date I've mainly used Scratch, which is great.  I would love to do some teaching based on Minecraft and have looked into it a bit.  There are a couple of hurdles I haven't got past.  

I haven't found a way to do interesting things without the full paid retail version.  Mods and scripting seem to require it.  

Even getting past the paid version requirement, configuration management and setup is a challenge for getting mods that support scripting working.  In a classroom with 27 students each on their own computer and a 45 minute class period, things have to just work.  Once you have to spend 5 or 10 minutes fixing one student's install or environment problem your effectiveness as a teacher for the day goes down dramatically.

The mod ecosystem is filled with out of date and inconsistent info on how to get things working.  You have to be pretty persistent and motivated to wade through it and get things working.  I spent about 3 days at the beginning of this summer just getting a Craftbukkit server setup for my daughter with the WorldEdit and a few other plugins.

I think the whole ""Minecraft for coding education"" space is ripe for Microsoft to deliver something that just works.  Unfortunately in the school environment where I work it is 100% MacBooks and iPads and I doubt Microsoft will deliver something for that environment (which I personally loathe but put up with)

I would love to hear about solutions to these problems.

"Moved here 3 years ago after being born and raised in Chicago, I wouldn't move back to Chicago after having lived here.

It's an adjustment but the city is super walkable, and easy to get around on public trans for uber. 

Food here is great.  Be ready to trade in sausage and other fried pork for salmon and crab.  Farmers markets are the way to shop, no more Jewel/Osco for you.

The Seattle Freeze is real.  I've hung out with one person from Seattle with regularity, every other friend is a transplant from the midwest or east coast.  Thankfully we are moving here in bunches and sort of forcing the warming of the Seattle people. Every major college has an alumni group here and the big 10 schools are well represented. Beware saying UW...people don't understand the real UW is in madison.  

People drive like they have no where to go and end up causing traffic that will make you sick.  Variable speed limits on the high way give me nightmares.  Go on the Seattle underground tour once and it will answer all your questions about city planning and how dumb it is.  

The weather is way better in Seattle.  Chicago legit has 2-4 weeks of awesome weather, otherwise it's cold and snowing or its humid and unbearable.  Seattle has 4-6 months of 70's and sunny with no humidity.  It rains here for about 6 months but it rarely gets under 40 and rarely snows.  

The mountains are great, hiking is awesome, being on the water is amazing.  I've become way more outdoors-y since moving here.

I'd say that at the end of the day the quality you get legally vs. the quality a 'good' dealer has is much the same.  

I think that the biggest difference, once WA figures out how to deal with edibles, will be the availability of dosed edibles (in other words, measured, quantifiable amounts - 10mg THC content per piece, etc.).  I think that the biggest turn off for many people who don't regularly use, besides the fact that it was illegal, was, unlike having a beer, people found it difficult to know how much to consume.  Your average person doesn't want to get high enough that they can't function, just like your average person doesn't want to get black out drunk every time they have a drink.

"&gt;I'll keep this brief.

Liar.



&gt;* Most rapes (or from what I am reading on your sources, most rape allegations) go unprosecuted. Have you seen how many false rape claims are made? There is a reason for it. Here is a [statement from Craig Silverman]

Yes, one right wing prosecutor is totally credible. N9t like the DoJ, who put false allegations at 2 to 4 percent.





&gt;* Yes, many celebrities and wealthy people get off Scott free for this crime. But they also do for everything else. 

So the Stuebenville rapists were rich celebrities? 

&gt;Of note, again directly addressing your remarks:

&gt;&gt; According to the April 4, 2011 “Dear Colleague” letter issued by the Department of Education, schools are now required to adjudicate all allegations of sexual assault separate from police investigations, must conclude their investigations and reach their verdicts (“findings”) in 60 days, and may arrive at different conclusions regarding guilt or innocence than the police and courts. There is a question as to whether colleges should be in the business of adjudicating felonies such as sexual assault in the first place, or whether they should leave it up to the police. In addition, while colleges adjudicate and punish sexual assault, they frequently fail to adjudicate and punish false accusations of sexual assault (see A&amp;M-Commerce Title IX Coordinator Michele Vieira’s statements to confirm this). See a list of articles and editorials here to learn more about the infamous “Dear Colleague” letter.

I am actually a college professor, so I am quite aware of how such cases are handled and it is almost alwsys a CYA for the college. The least college I taught at violated the Clery Act to such an extent that they were fined for it. Of course, that didn't help the victik, who had to drop out of school after being forced to reside in the same dorm as her rapist.

I do agree that the campus should not be gather evidence for a possibly felonious crime, though. My point is that schools make a hwbit of covering these crimes up, at the expense of victims. 

&gt;Again, as for the legal standard of law enforcement required to take action at the accusation. Law enforcement *must*, at the minimum, investigate an allegation of a crime and often just make reports that they refer to the prosecutor for a decision.

And this is different from other crimes how?

&gt;You don't believe me on that last point? Go ahead and look at my upvote/downvote count for these remarks. 

You are truly oppressed.

"I don't know that I've ever seen that topic specifically explored in any kind of study, so I can't really support myself here - but my perception is that, the initial outlay of infrastructure - especially considering relatively low current adoption levels - is going to be much more expensive, per capita, than it has to be, which puts (IMO) reasonable expenditures on-par per capita with current motor vehicle infrastructure per capita expenditures.  Studies have shown (I have to leave in like 5 minutes so no time to look it up now, but it's a common study - if you want to see the source let me know and I'll find it later) that cycling adoption grows alongside infrastructure development (no real surprise), and with adoption comes improved economics.

I think the current half per-capita level of expenditures, coupled with extremely lacking infrastructure development, demonstrates this.  We're spending 50% of the money per capita on bike support compared to motorist support, and our position as a cycling leader in the US is falling rapidly this last decade - and that's only comparing us to US cities; comparing us to many European and Asian cities, the differences are even worse.

1. Post signs around the neighborhood with a description of the car. If they were there early in the morning they might live around there.

2. Post signs in any local places with public bulletin boards (Molly Moon's maybe has one?, grocery stores, etc.) where lots of people will see them.

"We haven't even begun to figured out the cost overruns and subsequent funding yet, let alone a hundred other things going sideways right now. But they'll be there as these repairs are extremely expensive.

So? It was worth pointing at. Funding and overruns are a damn good reason to oppose a project. Let alone one that, in it's own studies, show traffic will be made worse downtown and it's extremely risky. I remember his opposition to the tunnel and his campaigns against it quite well. He was the only leader in the region to even *dare* question the project and it's assumptions.

McGinn: ""Ninety percent of megaprojects have cost overruns… Seattle has to pay overruns, but has no say over the project…[b]ecause the tunnel is a state-­controlled project, and the state maintains all decision-making authority over it… Cost overruns could lead to severe cuts to basic services.""

"I don't think the Circuit City example really applies to an increase in minimum wage and the effect it has on the real wage of tipped workers.  The author even acknowledges that a commissioned based model was probably never appropriate for a big box electronics retailer to begin with.  It seems like poor management decisions, like the wrong product mix, poor store layouts, and other factors led Circuit City to its demise. Switching to cheaper labor was an effort to reduce expenses.  

Tipped food service employees are not the same as knowledgeable commissioned sales people.  I am in sales now, and I worked in kitchens and served for 5 years.  The main difference between that Circuit City example and food service is that it was a management decision to restructure.  The minimum wage is mandated so I don't see how the Circuit City example applies.  Tipped employees are typically very replaceable. I highly doubt that a couple of people leaving a restaurant or bar because they are unhappy with the way post 15now played out will have any meaningful impact on the going concern of the restaurant.  Employee turnover at restaurants is already higher than most other industries anyway.  

Either way, I don't really think tips are going to go away in Seattle if the minimum wage goes up.  Like you said its baked into our society. I will always tip my favorite bartenders because we have established a good relationship. I think it is safe to say you will do the same.

"I have a couple of friends who moved from Seattle to Chicago, and I just visited them over the weekend. I've been there a few times before, but it was nice to experience it with a couple of now-locals.

Some notable differences: 
To me, it seemed like people there were much louder and more willing to strike up conversations with strangers. Most people here tend to avoid conversing with strangers unless they really have to. Also, as someone else said, Chicago is reeeeally into their sports, and even though people here love the local teams (especially given the Superbowl win), we aren't quite as rabid about it.

Chicago transit was definitely more convenient and frequent than most of ours, but depending on where you live, it's still pretty easy to get around without a car. And the Ventra card thing was a bit confusing, so I suppose you will be getting away from that.

Also, we unfortunately don't have BYOB restaurants or guys hawking tamales at bars.

"A lot of the seats at Seahawks games belong to longtime season ticket holders.  They put the remaining single-game tickets on sale in August, and I believe they sold out in less than a day.  So getting tickets to a game will be challenging, and potentially expensive.  I don't think I would trust scalpers on the street, or ads on Craigslist--counterfeit tickets are just too lucrative.  StubHub.com is more trustworthy--they guarantee tickets you buy there will be good.  They won't be cheap, but seeing a Seahawks game at Centurylink is an experience like no other.

But if you can't find tickets to the game, there are any number of sports bars around town where you can probably find a good crowd of rabid Seahawks fans (who are, as you've heard, batshit crazy).  Like /u/sharkbot says, Americans are suckers for Australian accents.  We also love to introduce  foreign visitors to our favorite things, like American football.  Find yourself a nice sports bar (here's [one list](http://www.seattlemet.com/bars-and-nightlife/sauced/articles/seahawks-sunday-where-to-watch-cheer-eat-and-drink-january-2013), or ask folks on /r/seahawks for suggestions), ask your neighbors some questions about the game, offer to buy the next round...instant BFFs.

As far as sightseeing...definitely, a drive up into the mountains should be on your list.  The [loop around Mt. Rainier](http://www.visitrainier.com/pg/driving_tour_scenic_byways_loop/Mt-Rainier-National-Park-Driving-Tour-Scenic-Byways-Loop) is a good day trip, and it's spectacular.  Another beautiful day trip is over to [Leavenworth](http://www.experiencewa.com/cities/leavenworth) (an overly-cute faux-Bavarian town, but the area is gorgeous) on US Hwy. 2, then down US Hwy. 97 and WA Hwy 970, and back to Seattle on I-90.  You could easily stretch either of those to a couple of days if you wanted to do some hiking along the way.

There are some beautiful drives over on the Olympic Peninsula.  You can do [Port Townsend](http://enjoypt.com/) (picturesque old lumber port, lots lovely of Victorian architecture, some good restaurants and pubs and shopping) in a day, up and back, if you take a ferry (Seattle-Bainbridge or Edmonds-Kingston).  Or, if you have more time, take the Seattle-Bremerton ferry and drive down around the bottom of the [Hood Canal](http://www.explorehoodcanal.com/) and up the east side.  It's not a man-made canal but a narrow fjord with dense forest on either side...really beautiful.  Or, do the drive all the way around the Olympic Peninsula, and visit [Hurricane Ridge](http://www.nps.gov/olym/planyourvisit/visiting-hurricane-ridge.htm) and the [Hoh Rain Forest](http://www.nps.gov/olym/planyourvisit/visiting-the-hoh.htm).  That's a two-day drive at least, three if you want it to be more leisurely.

And yes, marijuana is legal in Washington, and anyone over 21 can buy it...but finding it is the trick.  The state Liquor Control Board, which regulates the industry, hasn't been especially helpful in getting the recreational stores up and running.  There are only a couple open so far in or near Seattle ([Cannabis City](http://cannabiscity.us/) in the SoDo neighborhood and [Herbal Nation](http://herbalnationbothell.com/) up in Bothell), and they still have limited stock.  You'll also see lots of medical marijuana dispensaries, and they're fully supplied, but you can't shop there without a medical card.  If you do manage to score, as people have said, it's not legal to smoke in public...but getting caught with a small amount is a civil infraction—like a ticket.  You won't be arrested, and the fine is $27.  And that's IF you even get cited--Seattle police will often warn you the first time (and there's another place where an Aussie accent would probably come in handy).  So if you find yourself in a nice park, or a peaceful mountain trail...I wouldn't worry much about getting tasered and locked up.  Do keep in mind, however, that on Federal property (like Mt. Rainier or Olympic National Parks), federal law applies, and weed is still altogether illegal there--so don't light up there, or at least don't do anything to advertise it to the rangers.

"It depends on the situation. To honest, you *might* be right about some cyclists doing this, but it can be hard to tell unless you're riding it yourself.

The guidance is that a cyclist should 'take the lane' unless there's enough space for a car to pass in-lane while maintaining 3 feet of distance from the cyclist, while the cyclist has 2-3 feet of space from the curb.

The curb is where things get interesting. Often times there can be glass and debris that, if cars cause it to build up enough before the streets are cleaned, can actually take out a cyclist (sticks wedged in spokes, etc). A cyclist needs to maintain a buffer so that they can safely navigate around road debris without needing to swerve dangerously close to moving vehicles.

Not maintaining this sort of buffer can lead to the erratic and unpredictable behavior that motorists sometimes complain about from cyclists. :)

But regardless of whether they're right or wrong in the situations you've observed: please don't treat every cyclist like the bad examples you seem to witness.

"&gt; Scenario 1: Susie who is under 18 can have a firearm transferred to her legally, as long as her father who legally can own guns is there.

No, for fucks sake, that is not what the law says at all. Are you being intentionally dumb or what? Susie can have the gun, she can take the gun with her from the house, on her own, anywhere she wants, as long as any adult who can legally posses or use a firearm is with her. Anyone, you, me, anyone who can own a firearm.

&gt; Scenario 2: The father who watches Susie cannot have that same firearm transferred to him, because he is not to be trusted.

Yes, that is correct, first off the gun is not legally Susie's, it is a temporary transfer. She wouldn't be legally allowed to sell it, just like she wouldn't be legally allowed to sell her dads car when she borrows it.

"&gt; That's not even counting this one.

Criterion was trying to argue that more damage can be dealt in a short amount of time in comparison for a knife. But that is an argument dependent on many things such as training, the gun doesn't jam :D, and the shooter needs a lot of bullets.

The graph (if you can imagine) for this incident with that dude having a beretta with what, 8-10 rounds?, would basically flat line or plateau after those finite number of rounds. A knife attack on the other hand is rather linear and damage is dependent on the range of victims. One should not neglect the fact that even if you run the guy with a knife can too. 

I think it's sad how people will dismiss mass stabbings that occur around the world just because they aren't aware of it. Western media only picks up on a small portion of the crimes, and generally smaller rampages wont hit the headlines of China's state run media. If you want to find more you will want to search the internet the language spoken in whatever country. More news of stabbings will be found by americans if they would take the time to search in Cantonese or Mandarin, but you can't stop there are several other languages/dialects in China other than those two.",false,false,t1_clj9p5c,P0x26A,,0,1414228992,t5_2qhad,t3_2k7sfm,t1_clj2il4,1,1426359481,0,0,clj9p5c,Seattle,1,,,

"&gt;so these reviews have immediately turned me off those places, no matter what the other positive aspects were (e.g. location, price, specials, etc.).

And they should, don't let anyone else convince you otherwise

I lived in a place that has a bunch of bad yelp reviews, but also a bunch of ok or good ones. Personally i'd read what the reviews are about if there's more than one bad one. Do they mention the same things? 

At my place, at least, they did. A lot of the reviews complained about the manager, some about constant hot water issues, heat problems, but mostly the manager. There were also lots of other ""small"" problems.

I had already moved in when i found this( :( ) and it was... all, 100% true. From small stuff like the elevator breaking every week, turning it into a 5.5 floor walkup, to terrible stuff like waking up to no water at all when it was *planned* maintenance with illegally no notice(and getting reprimanded at work for being stinky... because i couldn't shower).

Eventually the upstairs apartment had a huge leak and destroyed my living room ceiling and wall. They never fixed it. When i moved out, they tried to charge us for ALL that damage, including repainting(oh and as a bonus claimed we had ""never told them about it""). And a bunch of stupid shit like a *tiny* chip in the kitchen tile that was in a place i couldn't have made it, a ""bent"" bathroom towel rack(it was 100 years old! it looked, well, 100 years old), and just lots of manufactured bullshit in addition to the ridiculousness of *water damage from another apartment being my problem*. 

There was also an issue where we had a small kitchen fire *because there was no smoke detector*(a pot basically melted even though it was full and not burning dry, i think the stove heating element fucked up, no one stands and watches a pot that's coming to a boil). The fire department showed up and made a note of that, and fined the fuck out of them. They then installed one *while the fire department was outside the apartment talking to us* and tried to claim we had taken it down/pulled the batteries out. Us, and the firefighters knew they were full of shit but they adamantly claimed this til the end of time. This was also part of the dumb, because they needed to repaint the entire place because of the water damage from upstairs, but tried to pin it all on smoke damage and ""stains"" from us(which wasn't much, on the smoke front). We even repainted most of the place with primer when we moved out because we anticipated this.

It was all true, and worse. We told them we were taking them to small claims over it, and they sent us to collections *with no notice until we got a letter from the collection agency* and just demanded all future discourse be with them. Oh, and they refused to do a walkthrough when we moved in OR out. The manager just whinged and whined because he's old and uses an oxygen tank. They then just completely made up whatever they wanted and *forged our signatures*.

This was the biltmore on capitol hill. I almost didn't name it, because every freaking time i have in the past some asshole comes forward to go ""i had a great experience there, you must have just been a shitty tennant/were probably an ashsole anyways! i got my whole deposit back!"". I will say that it's on capitol hill though, and it's old and large. 

In my years of living there i met 7 or 8 people who also lived there for a while, and hung out with some of them all the time. Every single one of them got dicked when they moved out, and had any issues ignored while they were there. Everyone had most or all of their deposit stolen, and at least two other people had money above the deposit demanded for completely manufactured reasons. Holy shit are people aggressive about liking the place though, i've been confronted by some random lady in a bar when i was talking to one of my old neighbors about our shitty experiences. 

I'm checking yelp every damn time now. My current place is small and doesn't have any or a yelp page, but if i'm ever looking at a place again and see a bunch of shitty reviews NOPE.

**EDIT**: be sure to read the ""not recommended reviews"", most of the negative ones seem to ~mysteriously~ end up in there for any apartment building i've checked.

"Crosswalks are the problem.  It gives some walkers a feeling of being in a bullet proof tunnel.  I see people talking or playing with their phones walking in them all the time ignoring all around them.  It would be better to remove the painted crosswalks and then get aggressive with ticketing drivers that ignore people crossing at all intersections.  

""For over 25 years, LADOT's crosswalk installation practice has been greatly influenced by a study published in August 1970 by Bruce Herms of the City of San Diego titled Pedestrian Crosswalk Study: Accidents in Painted and Unpainted Crosswalks. In the San Diego study, pedestrian accidents were investigated at 400 intersections over five years. Each of these intersections had two unprotected crosswalks-one marked and one unmarked-crossing an arterial roadway. Both of these crosswalks were legal crossings by definition in the California Vehicle Code.

An ""unmarked"" crosswalk is a legal crossing approximately perpendicular to the roadway that does not have painted lines or special surface material to designate the prolongation of the sidewalks of an intersecting cross street. The San Diego study concluded ""in terms of use, that approximately twice as many pedestrian accidents occur in marked crosswalks as in unmarked crosswalks.""

"During a previous recession (2003) I was nearly two years out of college with a CS degree and still unable to find a relevant position.  I did some time as a barista.  I went to London for 6 months where I got an paper-pushing internship with a government agency which was 1/2 unpaid (IOW, I worked 40 and was paid 20).  I stuck with that until my visa expired.  I then returned to the blue collar work that paid my way through college, with every passing month afraid that I would never hang up my toolbelt.  As that work started to dry up and I was down to 3 shifts a week, I got desperate and put a post on a tech forum offering free software development.  One small company responded and gave me a small project.  I spent a month or two on it, part time, while continuing to earn a living with a hammer.  They offered me a full-time position and I stayed there for 3 years.  

The risk paid off, but even if they hadn't offered me a position it was a better investment of my time to be putting a name and real work on my resume than getting stuck in the rut I was in.

"I agree that it's going to be difficult to get rid of zoning now that we have it. That's a very separate discussion from the rest.

I also agree that when you upzone the land, the land is then suddenly worth more - I'm not trying to say that doesn't happen. I'm saying that a particular zoned height isn't the economic reason that value happens; for the value to rise, demand was already high enough to take advantage of that height if the value increased.

Most of what you're suggesting here requires two unstated assumptions:

1) Developers have relatively unlimited money with which to sit on property. They do not; in fact, most of the people who sit on property to be developed are not developers. The more money a developer has to lock up on land that isn't being built, the lower their rate of return becomes, so they have limited leeway.

2) Developers are so risk-averse that they won't build unless it's a sure thing. History shows us this isn't the case - before there was zoning, there was dense development. The overall financial model has changed since then, and it would likely shift back to the model that existed in the early 1900s before height limits appeared. You're also assuming developers are perfect at predicting future demand - they are not, and allowing them more room to make mistakes would lead to some price drops, or slower price growth.

Past that, there's the basic displacement issue. No matter what, you trade a lot of short buildings for fewer, taller buildings if you unrestrict height. That creates affordability by just not displacing as many people.

It does take a long time for prices to stabilize, especially after a couple of decades of growth under these restrictions, as we've had now in cities like Seattle. This isn't a quick fix, it's the beginning of a stabilization.

There are a few reasons I think it's the best solution. First, though, I want to address the assertion that this is 'trickle-down'. Trickle-down was about lowering tax rates to encourage investment, cutting government services. This shares almost nothing with trickle-down except that it also acts on the supply side of the basic economic equation. The ever-normal granary did the same thing, as does the strategic oil reserve today, but we don't call those trickle-down. I think the reason we do here is that people categorize developers and bankers the same way psychologically, but there's no real justification for it. So, the reasons:

1) There's no other impactful solution on the table. There are some regulatory suggestions on the table, such as rent control or inclusionary zoning, but each of those are understood to lead to even more unjust outcomes, trading long term affordability for a short term fix. I'm happy to discuss why if you'd like. There are also suggestions of dramatically increasing the stock of government supported housing, but there's no money on the table to do that, and it would take tens of billions in a city like Seattle to catch up. In 2008, the last time the housing levy was renewed, the city council couldn't even agree to raise it to $225-ish million from $150-ish million because they believed voters would reject it (and polling backed that up). We're a couple of orders of magnitude away from making the impact that allowing height would.

2) Density leads to lower environmental impact, both short and long term, at least cost to governments of possibly any climate solution. More people currently want to live in density than we're allowing (hence the runup in prices). Every time we let another person, they're less likely to drive, they buy less stuff, etc.

3) This would likely decrease inequality. I know you above indicated that you believe developers would sit on land and also build less. There are several other variables in that equation, though. Right now, development has a high barrier to entry, as only some land in a city like Seattle is worth building on - most land with low intensity residential on it can't be built upward. If you unzoned (and note that I would only unzone Seattle in this area, I don't want a ton of sprawl), you'd see a lot of new people *become* developers, spreading out opportunity to those who didn't already have concentrated wealth, and causing a lot more opportunities for density. While I wouldn't argue it's impactful, these are some of the same reasons backyard cottages were recently legalized.

4) This is a little one, but if you really increased the value of a ton of land suddenly, you'd see property tax receipts increase (or in Seattle, where property tax is complicated, you'd reduce the effective rate on small landowners and make room for more infrastructure investment as a result). For basically every progressive issue, this would be a good thing, from school funding to transportation to mental health.

"Like I said, it's a long-term problem, certainly longer than just one generation. Any actions that can be taken right now will not have effects until much later. I'm a firm believer that so long as the human race makes forward progress in all areas of life, crimes like this will begin to be less common.

I agree that that area on Delridge is in awful shape, and the citizens there need more help than throwing public funding at them. But intangible things like education starting at the youngest ages are what is needed, with help for the older population that seeks it (family counseling, scholarships, etc.). Gentrification is a slow process and is also inevitable in a growing economy like Seattle, but the issue of supporting the youth that is there now should not be ignored, and will eliminate the need for gentrification in the first place.

It's not having access to healthy productive lifestyle that leads people to these types of petty crimes. 

EDIT: Also, proximity to a community college is not a good argument that these people should be educated if they want it.

Education doesn't have anything to do with how much you receive as a tip, it has to do with how difficult a job is, and how much the worker should be compensated.  If you could earn $100k/year waiting tables with zero education, why go to college?  If you go to college for 8 years to become a doctor, and only make $100k/year, then why become a doctor?  Jobs that require skills and lots of education pay more than those that don't.

"I disagree. I lived in Seattle for 11 years and worked in Redmond/Bellevue for the last 7 of them. If you work for a large tech company, chances are you'll get a free Orca card (which lets you ride public transportation for free). If you work for Microsoft, there's also the Connector, which is like their personal public transportation bus system. Some neighborhoods on the west side (Seattle) have express buses which can take you directly to work if you work on the east side (Bellevue/Redmond/Kirkland). Lastly, there are Metro van pools and ride shares which can also get you across the lake faster and with less of a hassle. I've done all of these. At one point I lived in the U-District of Seattle which has several express buses to Redmond and Bellevue. I also lived in Ballard (my favorite Seattle neighborhood by far), from which I took a van pool to Bellevue. The commute was only 30-ish minutes because van pools can use the HOV lanes. My two cents. Good luck in your move!
NOTE: I'm a 29 y/o female tech worker. My hobbies include karaoke, tabletop games, trying out new restaurants, and walking/exploring nature.

"In comparison to the college/military town in Kansas where I grew up...

The rain is welcome as opposed to the decade of drought Kansas has been in. Though winters are grey and wet it is still green unlike the drab scene of death where I grew up. 

On a clear day you've got mountains surrounding you, while the flint hills are beautiful there is simply no comparison. Lakes aren't low, you've got the ocean, city, mountains, and country all in one place. 

The city has its own charm as do the surrounding communities. If it weren't for the long gray winters I could picture myself buying a cute little house in Queen Anne or Ballard but I simply cannot take it much longer. Additionally I may not even be able to afford it. My boss bought a home in Ballard for $580 thousand whereas a home like that would go for $200 thousand back home.  

Some people love the gray, the drizzle, and the long winters. I didn't mind at first, it's certainly better than drought. You won't see people indoors due to the rain unless it's pouring or lightening, even children play in the rain. Though when it's sunny it's almost enough to forget the drab days and the population just about doubles. 

The costs are high in comparison to my home town. If you want to live in the city it doesn't come cheap. While the city is dog friendly pet rent and fees are high if the property even allows pets. Not to mention deposits seem high in general. Be prepared for your groceries, gas, utilities, and parking to cost more. Many people deal with the expense, like myself, because to them it is worth it. 

With any city you're going to have crime and you'll see the homeless, Seattle is no exception. There are many poor people, people living on the edge or without jobs for months. There is a soup kitchen behind my apartment complex. There is also traffic most of the time. It's traffic then worse traffic. 

You certainly cannot judge people for their appearance, a homeless person may actually be a hippie, a barefoot man in a t-shirt and cut off jeans may ride off in his fancy car, you may see a beggar in a suit, etc. 

There certainly is plenty to do in Seattle, people are friendly (but not necessarily your friends), coffee on every corner, Meetup groups, bicycle lanes (I've never seen so many bicyclists in my life), farmers markets, mom and pop shops, and dog parks (daycamps, dog friendly shops/pubs, etc).

Since living here I've been introduced to cider and pumpkin beer, great sushi, and food trucks. 

Lastly, If you don't put yourself out their it's difficult to make friends. 

Overall some people love the city and would hardly change a thing, there are others who tolerate what they don't like (gray and expense for example) for the good days, the convenience, etc, then their are others like myself that simply cannot deal with the winters regardless of how they feel. 

I compared Seattle to Kansas since that's what I know but truly places are beautiful in their own way and shouldn't be compared. You simply have to experience it, we moved here without having ever been here before. I'm glad we did experience it but we will move back (after living here 5 years) to the Midwest solely for the sun. Austin is on our radar.

"I know it's easy to make assumptions and be angry. I hope you don't just respond to this with frustration.

Originally, ridership was projected to be low enough that the cost to install and maintain ORCA readers was higher than the expected revenue. That changed, over time, as ridership was way over projections, but the new riders are nearly all pass users - a tap from them doesn't generate revenue. ORCA has always been accepted this way on the line.

Now that MOHAI and Lake Union Park have opened, it makes sense to install readers, as the number of ORCA user riders without passes is starting to increase. With the center city connector planned, that will increase further.

"OPs not the only one to run afoul of the mods here. A while back I posted a request for help getting access to some expensive and scarce hardware(a google glass) that we were pretty sure *someone* around town has. All the post said was that we wanted to invite a google glass wearer over for dinner in exchange for running some experiments. My post got delete immediately. For what reason? The mod who deleted it said that it was a rule 6 violation, which would make sense if I attempted to sell, profit, or market something which did not come up.

Now to some degree I do see where the mod was coming from, as it turns out I am working on research that will be used for an open source  project so I suppose it was a personal project that I *could* eventually profit from. But the facts are that I never once gave out the [website](http://www.optivity.net/) for the project, or mentioned it by name. I was simply looking for help from someone in the local community of which I am a resident so that we can build a low cost medical device. For this the mod deleted my reply which fully explained my reason for posting and then called me a ""corporate shill"". Which would be true if we had funding of any sort for this hobbist's project. And to be clear this project is going to be a kickstarter and no it is not designed to make us any profit because we really do think that this technology is cool and stuff that anyone should be able to teach themselves.

At the end of the day my post was not marketing or some play for non-existant profits. Compare my post to the weekly side-bar barrage of mod-endorsed bar trivia nights which **ARE directly** marketing local venues which directly generates profit. If that is OK why can't local hackers ask for help with their open source projects from their local community?

"FWIW the reason they flip it around is so they don't immediately see what you actually leave. Once you as a consumer make your choice, the transaction immediately disappears onto the main log and returns to the order screen.

So by the time they flip it around they only see their original screen to enter a transaction. Only when they go to pull final numbers do they see what you actually left, and by then it's on a list with a bunch of other transactions. They have to do some legwork to figure out who stiffed them, and often the shift tip-out is such that it's not much of an issue to them when someone does stiff them.

"[Here](http://www.howiechong.com/journal/2014/2/bike-helmets#.VCRFhxBwX5M) is a well research blog post about helmets.

Summary: 
1)The argument is based on statistics showing that head trauma is much more common while driving or even walking then cycling.  Not an argument against helmets, but just pointing out that ""your squishy head vs. rock hard asphalt"" sorts of arguments would apply to wearing helmets while walking or driving too.

2) Cyclists wearing helmets are more prone to accident statistically.  No one really knows why, but theories include: drivers treat un-helmeted cyclists differently, un-helmeted cyclists are more cautious, etc.

3) Helmet requirements represent a barrier to many would-be cyclists.  Maybe you don't want helmet hair before work, maybe you don't like your helmet, whatever.  not saying it's smart, just that requiring helmets has a tendency to keep would-be bikers from the road and the indirect effect is that cars are less familiar with cyclists.

Not saying you shouldn't wear a helmet - I ALWAYS do - but there definitely are good arguments against, and statistical evidence to at the bare minimum warrant a conversation on the subject.

Doesn't mean you actually understand what you studied.

"A friend of mine of Facebook summed it up rather well:
&gt; Putting cameras on police, as I said to a colleague earlier in the week, changes nothing.
&gt;
&gt; Putting cameras on police is a diversionary tactic. It is designed to play on your well-meaning faith in the idea that if brutality can be witnessed then it will not happen.
&gt;
&gt; If you believe this, here's a memo from the Department of Open Your Damn Eyes And Leave The House Once In A While: Black people have been witnessing brutality from police for a long time, often by experiencing it. So have other people of color. So have many, many, queers and trans* folks, POC and not. Sex workers too. And many other groups of socially marginalized people.
&gt;
&gt; I note that police brutality is still happening.
&gt;
&gt; Don't delude yourself into thinking that the prospect of immanent mechanical witness will stop anyone authorized to be brutal from being brutal. Present, real *human* witness of police brutality has not stopped it from happening.
&gt;
&gt; The problem is not that we need better, more reliable, mechanical witnesses. The problem is that we are already comfortable with dismissing witness when it interferes with our comforting notion that police brutality is always justified.
&gt;
&gt;The problem is that we have authorized the police to be brutal.

"Follow along.  My argument hasn't wavered once.  And it's explained above.

I'm saying that there is a set amount of increase to me.

""Footing the bill"" refers to the fact that people who don't own cars, but solely ride the bus won't be paying for this.  Yet ... they are the ones benefiting the most.  That is lopsided to me.

Defective logic. ... OK.  Or, I just don't get it.  Must be one of those two.

&gt;What kind of math are you using? ""60% of my tabs tripling""? I don't get where you're pulling tripling from in the first place, but ok.

Arithmetic.  20 * 3 == 60. ... 60% of that money is going to Metro, where the other 40% is going to roads.  Therefore, 60% of $60.  And ... it's ""selfish"" to expect people who don't own a car, and rely on one form of transportation ... to actually *pay* for it?  You and I have different definitions of that word, pal.

Because we all equally pay for schools, and a school system benefits society as a whole.  Same with parks, libraries, etc.  Again, I'm just repeating myself here, so just read my posts above.

&gt;And why can you not understand the indirect benefits to you, even as a driver, in buses. More buses = less cars = less traffic = less time in the car for you.

Me driving is the exact same indirect benefit to you.  One less passenger on the bus.  Or do you find that logic defective as well?

"So look.  I'm a non-practicing attorney.   I didn't want to say it before, because it's not needed to understand the basics of government structure in the U.S. We're not talking about high-level legal concepts here, but stuff anyone who took a civics class or watched a few episodes of law and order should know.

Legislatures write legislation. Executives sign legislation -- that's usually when the legislation becomes law.  There are many areas of law, including criminal law (which defines what a crime is).  Constitutions (like the US and Washington) and Charters (like Seattle) usually define what substantive areas that the legislative bodies (like the US Congress, the Washington Legislature and the Seattle City Council) are allowed to address.

For example:  the Seattle City Council does not have the power to declare war on a foreign country because the U.S. Constitution clearly gives that right to the U.S. Congress.

For example: the U.S. Congress does not have the power to regulate the taxi industry in Seattle because it was not granted that substantive jurisdiction and because Washington law does.

Now, back to when something becomes 'illegal' -- that happens when legislation is appropriately passed.  If the Seattle City Council passed an ordinance that said ""no cannon fire in city limits"" and the Mayor signed it, that would make firing cannons illegal.  End stop.  Doesn't have to be reviewed by a judge -- the legislature and executive make the laws.

When someone violates a law, and the enforcement agencies (whatever they happen to be in that specific situation) and prosecuting agencies (whatever they happen to be in that specific situation) want to pursue it, they do. 

For example (and this will greatly oversimplify and not get into issues of reseasonable searches, etc.), if the SPD sees someone committing a crime and feels that they have sufficient evidence, they can arrest.  Prosecutor (could be city attorney, could be county, could be US attorney) then could choose to file charges.

Then, after a series of hearings, lets say there's a trial.  In most trials, judges are arbiters of law.  Sometimes they also act as fact-finders -- other times a jury acts as fact finder.  Neither the judge nor a jury makes a determination of 'legal' or 'illegal.'  The fact finder makes a determination of guilty or not guilty of the charged offense.

On very rare occasion, a judge (prompted by a defense motion) may rule that a law, duly passed by a legislature and signed by an executive, is unconstitutional, violates city charter, whatever.

That can be appealed etc.

This has nothing to do with martial law.  

Judges do not routinely decide if actions are legal or illegal. But whether the state proved that the party was guilty of the charged offense.

The City of Seattle has substantive jurisdiction over the regulation of taxis inside the city limits.  They previously used that jurisdiction to pass a set of regulations, which have been the prevailing law in the city for a few decades now.  Rideshare operators do not comply with this law; ergo, they are operating illegally.  

They may well operate illegally for the next 150 years, but that doesn't change the fact that they are.  I don't even think that they dispute that, so I have no idea why you would go to such great and inaccurate lengths to do so, but I hope this was helpful.",false,true,t1_cfsnujz,brachko,,0,1393793427,t5_2qhad,t3_1zaoeq,t1_cfsn4vn,0,1432628095,0,0,cfsnujz,Seattle,0,,,

"&gt; The issue is people spend a lot of their money on entertainment. Video games, TV subscriptions, new tv, new sound system, brand name clothing ect.

Some people sure. Not even close to a majority.

&gt;Why should they get 15$ an hour while some counselor who works for the government is making 11 or 12$ an hour? Or a teacher?

I've said this in other threads. When fast food workers ask for $15 an hour they aren't prefacing their demand with ""because we want to be paid more than teachers!"". They're asking for $15 an hour. If I could waive a magic wand and fix the economy exactly how I would want counselors and teachers would be making quadruple what a burger flipper makes at minimum what construction workers make. Not paying fast food workers enough to take care of themselves because some teachers don't even make enough to take care of themselves isn't really a world view I can identify with at all. I think the real crime is that even after all that schooling, sometimes upwards of a decade, it's not assumed that teachers will be making more than a shift lead at the burger joint.

Why work your ass off unless being a teacher was a personal dream? I guess there's the added benefit of not getting grill burns but seriously what the fuck is up with our cultures' work to value ratio in terms of being a teacher? I know of no other job that requires that much dedication and outside of work time that gets paid so little. I wouldn't want to put forth the effort to be a full time teacher because I won't get enough value in return. That's the crux of this problem I identify with. In every sector you see nearly identical behavior. The corporate big name brand employee who walks by a piece of garbage in their store because their job is sales and picking up that garbage wouldn't get them considered for higher compensation for doing another job.

&gt;It's a problem of motivation, all right? Now if I work my ass off and Initech ships a few extra units, I don't see another dime, so where's the motivation? 

I've luckily found my motivation in the STEM field but I still strongly identify with the underlining economic feeling here. It's going to be a shit job for shit pay so as long as you do enough to keep yourself employed, putting the extra effort in won't enhance your pocketbook by default, you have to find a boss willing to let go of some of the extra profits they've made for you, and when the job only demands the minimum amount of effort people who want to be paid for the work they do will find themselves looking for employment elsewhere.",false,true,t1_chy4xqx,watchout5,,0,1401812465,t5_2qhad,t3_274mos,t1_chy3pzd,1,1434076047,0,0,chy4xqx,Seattle,1,,,

"Doing the usual?  Yeah, *""The man had earlier attacked a security guard.""* The usual. And he was illegally setting a fire, smashing bottles, and more than likely being generally disruptive.  If that's the usual then I want security and the police to tell/force him to stop.  How **he** responds is totally up to him.

You don't know that.  I will argue that.  You're a private citizen; you can allow someone to break the law, assault someone, then deescalate the situation and walk away.  Police have a responsibility to enforce the law and apprehend said suspect.  Have you, after being attacked, placed someone in custody?  Probably not...

"If someone walks somewhere to do something, they'll be more likely to follow through with what they are actually doing because they went there for a purpose.

Most college students jack around on the internet in their dorms, but they actually walk to the library and use the internet there to be productive. It's the same concept of stocking a refrigerator or cupboard with food. If you have more in your house and it's easier access and readily available, you'll more than likely overeat because of convenience rather than necessity. Whereas if you only buy as much as you need for a day or two, and keep going to the grocery store often to get more food, you're less likely to overeat and take the food you have in your house for granted. It's a psychological thing that all humans encounter. Hunter/gatherer societies had to work for their food and ate less because they had to make an effort to obtain that.

The employee there apparently did not activate the modem, which caused my account to be cancelled after five business days, with no warning to me whatsoever (the modem and internet account worked fine during those five days).

"&gt; That same logic can be used to say that every driver is one more open seat on the bus for you. Less standing. So ... we are both using my car, but you just aren't allowed to ride in it.

That's a false equivalence if I've ever heard one, considering most people aren't even close to the same size as the average car. Even if you pair people up, putting all those people in cars takes up a lot more space than a single bus, and uses orders of magnitude more fuel, increasing demand and therefore cost. Plus, more cars on the road means my bus ride (*and* your car ride) to work gets longer due to increased congestion. Besides, in this case, lack of sufficient funding means that there will be less buses actively carrying the same number of people, meaning I'll be less likely to 

&gt; Increased costs are a penalty

You are certainly free to look at it that way, but it doesn't seem to serve much purpose except to get riled up over, to me. Accounting for inflation, we're actually paying less and less over time against a steadily increasing local population, and that goes for everything, not just the buses and roads.

Maybe you don't use the buses, but the cost-sharing taxes do isn't about getting to pick and choose your services a la carte. Surely you use at least one other service provided by that same cost-sharing mechanism more than other people, so it amortizes out. In the end, you're still spending *less* money than any of these things actually *cost*.

&gt; Washington State drivers already pay some of the highest fees in the nation, as it is.

[Not even close](http://www.ncsl.org/research/transportation/registration-and-title-fees-by-state.aspx). Just skimming the list, a number of other states have fees at least as high as ours, with several states already doubling or tripling that.

&gt; Find the money elsewhere. I am *not* Metro's bailout option. And it's that simple.

So, where is all that money supposed to come from, anyway? Metro [already gets more than half of its funding from sales taxes](http://metro.kingcounty.gov/am/budget/revenue.html).

I mean there are venues that are barebones where you'd have to provide everything, sound, drinks, security, etc, but thats a lot of overhead. Are you looking at a 16/18 up crowd or 21+ or what?

It really all depends, and its not super hard to do if you got the cash to throw down for a night.

Actually, that's exactly what a zipper merge is, except it requires cooperation from the drivers in the other lane --- they're supposed to gracefully alternate instead of trying to exclude each other.

It's funny, really because I know that everyone who is disagreeing with me has never seen a real zipper merge.  I don't mean this in a bad way, or anything, but I know that if you saw a true zipper merge, you would really understand.  Believe me, there is no ""formula"" for making a zipper.    A true zipper means nobody has to stop or even slow down.

"I see elderly bicyclists, families on bikes all of the time, and I've never had my nice bicycle stolen (knock on wood). Point being that there are lots of pros and cons everyone weighs when thinking about taking up cycling. On the internet you often see lots of people talk only about the pros or only about the cons. The people enthused by bicycles (including elderly and moms and dads) find lots of great reasons to bike. Those not so enthused finds lots of reasons not to. What I think we should all be able to agree on is that it should be made easier to take up cycling and walking, so that the list of cons becomes miniscule.

Protected bike lanes will bring high densities of cyclists along specific important corridors, making it comfortable and safe to cycle to major destinations. Neighborhood greenways will create safe ways to walk or bike to the grocery store and parks in your neighborhood, making it easy and fun to get the kids out of the house.

A high frequency transit grid can get you up the hills you don't want to power up yourself. Light rail cars can carry more bikes than busses can. And the bike share will make it easy to connect your bus or light rail trip that last mile to home, office, or giant street fair/parade. It will also lower the barrier of actually owning a bike to those who can't afford the cost or the hassle.

Seattle is becoming denser than ever and the demand to travel to destinations within Seattle is only growing.

As far as a sudden, localized decrease in throughput, if you can rule out anything in your local network that's doing a bunch of network i/o (eg. torrent app running in b/g, dropbox syncing), that's a good first step... 

If you're coming to this conclusion over a wireless connection, then it could be attributed to that band/channel suddenly being crowded in your immediate area. Maybe going to a completely different band (5ghz), or manually selecting a different 2.4ghz channel could help?

---

&gt;The Seahawks played their home games at the [Kingdome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdome) from their [1976 inaugural season](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1976_Seattle_Seahawks_season) until [1999](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_Seattle_Seahawks_season). In 1995, a proposal was made to issue [county](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_County,_Washington) [bonds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_(finance\)) to fund a remodeling project of the facility. The proposal failed, and as a result, Seahawks' owner [Ken Behring](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Behring) threatened to sell or move the team. In 1997, local billionaire Paul Allen pledged to acquire the team if a new stadium could be built and said that the team could not be profitable until they left the Kingdome. He asked the [state legislature](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_State_Legislature) to hold a special statewide [referendum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendum) on a proposal to finance a new stadium. Allen also agreed to cover any cost overruns. With Allen agreeing to pay the $4 million cost, the legislature agreed. The vote was scheduled to be held in June 1997, but in May, a Seattle resident filed a lawsuit that claimed the legislature did not have authority to call for such a vote, since it would be paid for by a private party who could gain from the result. The case was delayed until after the vote. The proposal was pitched to voters as providing both a new home for the Seahawks and a venue for top-level soccer. It passed on June 17, 1997, with 820,364 (51.1%) in favor and 783,584 against. The vote was close in Seattle, but it received 60% approval in Seattle's northern and eastern suburbs. The public funding was unpopular farther away in the [eastern portion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Washington) of the state. In October, a [Thurston County](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thurston_County,_Washington) [Superior Court](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superior_Court) judge ruled that the legislature acted properly and in the public's interest, and he dismissed the pending lawsuit. The [Washington Supreme Court](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Supreme_Court) upheld the decision that December.

"[DiscNW](http://www.discnw.org/) is definitely the resource you need     
       
There are a variety of options.       
   
- Pickup - free-for-all games around town that anyone can join. Some are more structured than others, some are even different games completely (goaltimate, mini, beach, etc.). No commitment - just show up and run. Ideally there will be one at a park near your house, who play at your skill level, and you can become friends with. Otherwise - drive to one that you enjoy. You can just about find one every day of the week if you are willing to drive.           
      
- Hat leagues - Where anyone is able to sign up, good place to start - probably just like your current rec league. You'll get put onto a team and play 8-10 games over the season. These are typically Spring, Summer, Fall. Huge variety in ages, although 22 is a good guess at average.      
       
- Team league - MUCH bigger. They have all 4 seasons, with multiple levels at each. *A* would be competitive, mostly club players. *D* is newer players, and a fine place to get started. You just need to find a team to join (or create your own). I'd like to get on a *C/D* team myself - but haven't found the right team.    
       
- Tournaments - some are hat, most are team. Again - you'll need to join with a group of people or attend one of the open-to-all options.    
    
- Club - I'm less familiar here, but this is more 'serious' than the leagues. Teams will practice and attend tournaments, ultimately competing against all teams in the section, region, nation. There are men, women, and co-ed teams.      
    
- Professional - get paid to play! [Rainmakers](http://seattle.rainmakers.mlultimate.com/) and [Raptors](http://www.sraptors.com/)

"&gt; First of all, that's not wind noise, its road noise from the vibration of the bicycle traveling. And road noise is variable, it will change. Even if it was wind noise, the wind changes too. Doesn't prove anything about his speed or when he began braking. And you think that you can accurately determine he started braking because you think the scenery started to go by slower? On a fish-eye lens helmet-mounted cam? Are you serious?
 
You're arguing a strange semantic. Are you arguing that he *didn't* brake? Are you arguing that he began braking earlier than I said? Not sure where you're going with that. 

&gt; I'm saying that the fastest he could have typically reacted was .75 seconds to begin braking, not to have already stopped.

No, the fastest *average*, including the ultra low reaction times of drunks and tired drivers. Go [here](http://www.humanbenchmark.com/tests/reactiontime/stats.php) and take an honest assessment of your reaction time. Is it .75 to 1.5 seconds? I hope not.

&gt; Oh yeah, I forgot that as soon as I touch my brake levers that I stop. Totally forgot about that.

This is how I know you're confused, so take a step back and read what I said. From the time the car crossed the center line to when *I estimated* he *began* braking, 1.91 seconds had passed. Removing my .5 seconds or your .75 seconds from that still allows over a second to begin to stop.

"Insurance and liability. As it stands right now, if a taxi were to plow into you and put you into the hospital you could expect the cab company's insurance broker, which they are legally obligated to have cover their drivers up to very high liability levels, to settle for your medical bills and such. The official policy of  Uber and other similar startups is ""fuck that, we are totally not a cab company"", and so don't purchase any insurance on behalf of their drivers. So in that same situation you would be having to fight the driver's private insurance for your medical bills. Private insurance companies are starting to get wise to this however, and are putting exclusions in their policies to prohibit their customers from filing claims while working for rideshare companies (since there is a difference in insuring a car for private use versus commercial, which is what having people pay you to drive them around should obviously be). So the drivers private insurance might not cover it. So you'd be stuck hoping the driver himself can cover it without declaring bankruptcy. Meaning you'd be s.o.l.There's a case where this playing out in SF right now actually- a driver for Uber hit and killed a young girl while taking calls for the service, and Uber is trying to deny any responsibility based on their claim that they aren't a cab company and therefore not liable for their drivers actions.

"I moved here from Boston over 9 years ago. Let's start with the Debbie Downer part of this comment...

Used to live in an awesome 2-bedroom apartment on the Wallingford/Fremont border, dog-friendly and paid $925 a month for 5 years. Now? I'm sure that apartment is renting for a hell of a lot more than that.

We decided to buy a house down in the Kent/Covington area back in 2010, wanting more space and more yard and you can't get that in Seattle unless you want to drop lots of money. 

It was great for the first few years; we caught the Sounder in every morning and our commute was pretty easy. Then things just got insane, like others have said, things are growing extremely rapidly around here so more and more people are commuting into the city. 

We no longer are able to take the Sounder due to a lack of parking, so we have to drive in every day... and pay for parking in downtown (it ain't cheap). It sucks, the commute has gotten beyond terrible (hour and a half just yesterday morning), and I sometimes think about selling our house and moving a bit closer. But the problem still remains: The commute sucks from all over unless you live IN the city, which we don't want.

Now for the better parts!

Crappy traffic/commuting aside... Seattle is absolutely BEAUTIFUL. We have amazing food, the weather is awesome (yeah it rains a lot during the fall/winter, but it's actually refreshing to see after the non-stop sunny weather), you have mountains and islands and the ocean and lakes and all sorts of places to explore... I could go on. It makes it beyond worth it to live here. Any time I've ever gotten really pissed off and done with our commute, I think about where I'd move to and honestly... I still wouldn't leave Seattle. I would miss it here too much.

And yeah, there is the ""Seattle chill"" from people, so it can be tough to make friends. Being from Boston, I am very used to a more blunt/up-front kind of attitude with people - you know where you stand with them - so sometimes that has been a little tough for me because people here seem to have less of that rough edge/attitude. But you'll manage!

Just plan on paying pretty high rent if you want to live close to the city, and make sure you explore as much as possible.

"Probably your best bet as far as getting some elevation and having a nice viewpoint would be to take public transport out to Issaquah, and hiking up Tiger Mountain to Poo Poo Point.  On a clear day you'll see the whole valley Seattle sits in, with a good view of Rainier from the lower clearing.  

Best route using public transport would be to catch the 554, it will run all the way into Old Town Issaquah, follow the signs for the Rainier trail heading south.  Loop around the highschool and pick up Highschool trail on the backside.  From there walk up hill following the signs at the various trail junctions on the mountain towards Poo Poo Point.  Here's a handy map http://i.imgur.com/sHjS3NY.jpg

This route is roughly four miles of hiking (8 miles roundtrip) with about 1600 feet of elevation gain.  It's all uphill, but at a fairly moderate grade for the most part.  You'll see some swamps, a couple of small waterfalls, a few bridges, lots of moss and even some old growth forest near the top.  When you reach poo poo point you'll have a gorgeous view of the valley below.  If you loop down about 1/8 mile on the trail opposite of how this has you approaching you'll have a lovely view towards the south of lots of farmland and Rainier in the distance. 

It's a gorgeous hike, fairly easy, with a very nice payoff.

But let's err on the side of being skeptical and say that only 1 in 10 metro riders already own a car, but use transit instead. That's 10% of transit riders. If I take King County Metro's yearly rider stats (source [here](http://metro.kingcounty.gov/am/reports/monthly-measures/ridership.html)), determine how many metro riders per day there are, and then just straight average across the existing 228 metro routes, I come up with 1450 daily riders per line. Yeah, this is a bullshit number, just go with it for now. That means there are now 145 people per day that are using cars that weren't before. For one route. Multiply that by the the number of affected routes - of which there are about 215 (source [here](http://metro.kingcounty.gov/am/future/pdfs/changes/20140424-table-of-routes.pdf)) and you've got an additional ~31000 cars on the road per day that weren't there before.

"Posting anything that questions all these shiny towers is to be exposing oneself to being blasted by numerous vocal pro-development voices on here.  It's not something everyone is that interested in doing, for some reason.  Hive mind on /r/seattle is pretty much pro big building, pro change, and fuck anyone that disagrees.

Also, don't know if you're aware, but actually fighting city building codes is kind of a rigged game.  Not all of us have time for what would be a nearly full time job of fighting the hearing examiner on yet another big project, it's literally volunteering to go fight against the city, the developer, the architect, and possibly the architect's attorneys.  

To effectively battle against what the city considers appropriate building and interpreting, you have to become at least as good a rules mechanic about housing and zoning as the people working at the city.  You also have to understand that the city's hearing examiners and plans examiners aren't really interested in John Q Public's random upsettedness regarding how much shit the neighborhood's going to have now that their decision has unleashed another 1000 condos into what had been an affordable block previously.  They don't care.  The process doesn't care.  The process is too busy figuring out how the height allowance of 6 floors can be cheated into being 7 and 1/2 if you borrow some of the height from one end of the building and apply it to a penthouse, excuse me, a 'dormer' on the other side of the building, while you start counting from the uphill side for one thing but the downhill side for the other thing when counting up stories.  all kinds of games they play with height allowances on these projects.  Saw it happen for 2 years.

Source: I actually clerked at what was then DCLU 20 years ago as an undergrad.  Neighbor Wars was just getting going then.  It was developer versus pissed off irate neighbor all day, with me handing out the records for them to do battle.

Guess which side won the day almost every time.

Your best hope is to delay projects, starve out a developer's funding possibly ... but if they're committed to building, the project never really gets stopped.  The developer will agree to some silly modification, like adding more trees on the sidewalk, and the hearing examiner will sign off.  Or if you're actually winning, they'll hold a meeting in secret and decide a key point and not tell you, then it'll appear on the plans later as having already been approved.  I saw the city pull quite a lot of shit on these things.   The big developers know how to play this game to get plans approved.  DLU signs off on stuff, then later someone pulls the plan record and says something like ""how the heck did we ever sign off on that?""  But the building's built by then.

also, 'housing for downtown workers' sounds nice, but let's be honest, you're talking about a $2000 and up condo or high-end apartment.

If there were no limits, and 5,000 cabbies were driving around, the competition would lead to lower fares (and lower salaries for the drivers) as they all raced against each other to capture what business they could. Companies would go out of business trying to compete with each other; until after lots of volatility, the market would figure things out and a balance between number of drivers and demand by passengers would be achieved (in theory at least).

The cap is meant to decrease volatility and protect drivers from low wages caused by a high ratio of supply to demand (again, in theory).

Whether you think the market should be left alone to figure it out or whether you think the government should step in to try and provide stability for drivers (and consumers), Sawant's support of government regulation shouldn't surprise anyone.

&gt; A software developers pay is roughly the same each and every year __unless you get a promotion or raise (naturally)__. 

You have a rough target they want you to be at. That target goes up based on your performance but normally in a steady, corporate fashion. They will reward more stock (and some base salary) to meet that target if you will not meet it. This can happen two ways (or a combination of them):

* Your stock goes down in value.
* Your target goes up in value due to performance.

The managers dish out stock to keep you at your target roughly.

"I've lived in the U District for a long time, and I've noticed four types of homeless people here:

* Some of the homeless folks here are clearly genuinely mentally ill and alone. I've seen some of these faces for years. These folks tend to wear plastic bags and have loud conversations with themselves.

* Others come and go quickly. They generally don't beg; they just find a quiet spot to sleep for a few nights, and then they're gone. I assume that these are regular people who had a bad break, and eventually they recover and get on with their lives. These folks tend to be pretty much normally dressed, though obviously a bit dirty.

* Some are career homeless. I've seen people commute on the bus to panhandle here; I'm guessing some of these people aren't actually homeless, but found that you can make a decent living in Seattle standing around with your hand out. These people tend to be middle-aged men, in worn-looking but otherwise normal clothing.

* Finally, you've got some younger people who spend their days sitting around chatting, eating fast food and drinking beer. These folks tend to dress quite fashionably, albeit for some subculture. (Lots of tattoos, dyed hair, bits of metal sticking out of them. I'm not up on labels, but you probably know what I mean.)

Categories 1 and 2 have had bad breaks in life. Can't fault them for that. Categories 3 and 4, I don't think it's a stretch to describe them as lazy and unmotivated. I'm sure they've had some bad stuff in their life, but this is what they are choosing to do for now.

"&gt; First, it is not ""pretending,"" because there really is a loophole. You object to the term ""loophole"" because you feel it means that the exception to the law is a mistake. That is not what loophole means. It simply means there is a way for people to circumvent something in the law that would otherwise be required.

Except that there's no ""circumventing"" anything that is ""required"" because there's no ""requirement"" for a background check on private sales.  That's by design.  Pretending that face to face sales between non-prohibited persons require a background check except at a ""gunshow"" is dishonest bullshit that relies on scare tactics and ignorance.  That's never been a requirement. It's not circumventing anything - when you buy from a FFL, you have to get a background check.  This is expanding those requirements to private sales.  

&gt; Second, you are saying that local movements to remove the private sale exception to the background check is evidence that the legislatures who passed the federal law acted in bad faith?

No, you clearly can't read. I'm saying that the antigun proponents pushing these expanded background check requirements acted in bad faith.  At the federal level, they pretended they were satisfied with the NICS requirement for dealers, then a couple years later they showed they wanted more and started the ""gun show loophole"" campaign.  They were defeated when Manchin-Toomey went down, so they've moved to state level restriction attempts.

"Nobody wants to drive. People drive to get from point A to point B in the fastest amount of time, and hopefully a predictable amount of time. Cyclist traffic is annoying:

1. The city takes 20%-40% of the space on crowded arterials to build bike lanes. The roads clog and the commute duration increases significantly, especially at rush hour. All to appease a tiny minority (5% on a sunny day) of die hard cyclist commuters.

2. Some cyclists are reckless and unpredictable. Drivers want to follow their routine (save brain energy) while driving, not be 100% over alert to random bikes zipping from dead angles. Drivers don't want to kill people. Mixed traffic is stressful and unpleasant.

3. On narrow streets, you get cyclists that take the lane and forces cars to slow down to snail pace. In the big picture, it only adds a few seconds. But the driver's brain extrapolates this to the whole distance, and thinks ""Gosh, I'll get to B three times as slow"".

It may not be politically correct, but unless cyclists align their speed to the rest of the traffic, obey the rules of the road and stop asking for ridiculously luxurious privileges (imagine special car lanes reserved by law to the elite 5%!), there will be animosity.

Since the above can't really happen per the laws of physics, it looks to me like cycling ought to remain a recreational activity, funded in proportion to its actual usage by the city.

In California, the ""HOV Lane"" is called the carpool lane, and it has double-double yellow lines with little bumpadees separating it from the rest of the freeway. There is a carpool lane entrance/exit every couple miles where the double-double yellow lines become a broken white line for a hundred feet or so, and you can move in or out of the lane. Crossing the double-double lines is equivalent to actually driving over a median, and the ticket for doing so is somewhere around $400. People fudge this pretty commonly if they've juuuuust missed the carpool lane entrance or exit, but it's pretty rare to just see someone ignore the laws outright and move in and out of the carpool lane at will.

&gt;__Isinglass__ (/ˈaɪzɪŋɡlæs/ or /ˈaɪzɪŋɡlɑːs/) is a substance obtained from the dried [swim bladders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swim_bladder) of [fish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish). It is a form of [collagen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collagen) used mainly for the [clarification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarification_(wine\)) of [wine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine) and [beer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer). It can also be cooked into a paste for specialized gluing purposes.

&gt;Isinglass was originally made exclusively from [sturgeon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturgeon), especially [Beluga sturgeon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beluga_sturgeon), until the 1795 invention by [William Murdoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Murdoch) of a cheap substitute using [cod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cod). This was extensively used in [Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom) in place of [Russian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia) isinglass. The bladders, once removed from the fish, processed and dried, are formed into various shapes for use.

"There have been a lot of changes the past couple years at WY. I have been here for four years and have been through three rounds of layoffs. Last August they brought in the new CEO, and weere all fairly sure his goal is to just have a company that is holds only its core Timberlands and has a fancy office in Seattle and uses its status as a Real Estate Investment Trust to return large dividends to shareholders. His message over the past year has been about 'Making Weyerhaeuser a Truly Great Company'. 

Since 2008 or so the company has been running in 'Keep the lights on' mode at the bare minimum level of staffing, and this past November the CEO announced another $75 million in cuts to the sales, general, and administrative budgets, which resulted in pretty much a 25% staffing cut across the board in corporate and the absolute demolishment of R&amp;D. So they went from 'Keep the lights on' to I'm not even sure what anymore. The company has also done everything it can to eliminate any kind of benefits, such as the pension, all the health and wellness benefits, etc. One of my old coworkers told me they announced they are ending company cell phones and that employees will be expected to have a personal smart phone to respond to company calls/e-mails.

I was included in the latest cut. I feel sorry for the individuals left. My department went from 8 people down to 2 people left there and also absorbed the work of two other teams that were liminated.

A lot of the people left that I am still in contact with have already decide they will not be moving. Weyerhaeuser is an aging work force, and most of the seem very sure that this is just a way to push them out the door without having to worry about claims of age discrimination. 

Of course everyone last year was pretty sure this is what was going to happen. The rumors started swirling after the new CEO bought a $2 million condo up in Seattle.

"I know this probably won't go over well, but the reason I voted no was because this represented an increase in my taxes to make road improvements on roads that I don't use.

The way I see it, when you vote you generally vote on what is best for you.  Our county road is horrible and we can't get the county to fix it, the road repair funding that this bill was offering would never have been used to improve our roads.  To be frank, I'm somewhat tired of paying taxes that are constantly increasing while not being able to get basic maintenance (such as to prevent the runoff that is flooding our lawn).

In the end, I figure if this benefits enough people then it will pass, whereas if this represents a general tax increase to benefit a smaller subset of people then it likely would not pass.

as for the arguments about buses, I would like to understand how this would increase the number of people who ride the bus.  Buses are already clearly the _much_ cheaper option for commutes, people use a car for the convenience.  This may make buses cheaper but those who use a car won't start riding the bus.  They're not driving because it's cheaper, they're driving because it's convenient.

"Fuckers. They're betting you'll either swallow it or just move out in a huff because it's too much of a pain in the ass to stand up for your rights. If you do want to fight, you should call a lawyer (I am not a lawyer) and make sure that communications with your property manager are all done in writing.

[Here's a relevant site](http://www.seattle.gov/dpd/codesrules/codes/rentalagreementregulation/default.htm). To me, it confirms your reading of of the law. Regarding penalties, see [this part of the code](http://clerk.seattle.gov/~scripts/nph-brs.exe?d=CODE&amp;s1=7.24.060.snum.&amp;Sect5=CODE1&amp;Sect6=HITOFF&amp;l=20&amp;p=1&amp;u=/~public/code1.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G) - My reading of that is that if they raise the rent on you in this way (without the 60 days notice), the penalty is the difference in rent, plus double any penalties (e.g. late fees) they place on you, plus your attorney fees, plus $1000.

But you need it in writing, and need to talk to a lawyer. A lawyer might be happy to help you if they're confident they can recover their fees. It seems like you might be able to just say ""okay"", sign the new month-to-month agreement, and then sue them later (that would be pretty sweet justice). But a lawyer might also advise you to just refuse to pay (for at least 60 days) and count on them not being able to evict you in that time anyway.

Don't tell them that you're going to talk to a lawyer - you need to have the new rental agreement, and want to get advice from the lawyer first. Unless you just want the legally required 60 days, in which case sure make a threat and maybe they'll just say ""ok we'll give you 60 days"". But I'm kind of hoping you let them walk themselves down this road and then screw them in the ass. Good luck, and please let us know how it goes.

"First off, chill the fuck out there buddy. Three etcetera's? Industry-accepted standard. But six? Clearly taking this waaaay too personally. 

Secondly, lets talk WSDOT in general terms. Like many services provided by the government, WSDOT gets its income for major projects through proposals leading into grants, but also through the state budget and revenue generated via services, like bus fares, tolls, and all those wonderful fees I mentioned before. There are of course exceptions, bills and legislative stuff can also support DOT-related projects, but for now lets keep it simple.

Now this is pure speculation based off common knowledge of how our government works, but I'm going to have to assume the interstates fall under federal jurisdiction (which is why I don't believe I-5 will be tolled, but why WA520 is and WA90 might). So when we pay our federal income tax, we pay for this infrastructure a bit. Cities maintain their streets because that's part of their responsibility(Theres some gray area here. A good confusing example is the bullshit tunnel that's racking up huge amounts of debt; nobody knows if the state or the city's going to pick up the bill), but since we don't do income tax in seattle, it just comes from the city budget, maybe those parking meters. Meanwhile WSDOT does things like fix or upgrade major roadways, like all that construction on I90...You know, shit that applies multiple regions, aka statewide. Part of that money comes from the state budget, part of it comes from whatever revenue the fees bring in (generally revenue created in one dept stays in that dept to sustain it). Of course that money also pays for things like repairing buses, paying drivers, and any other number of costs.

Notice anything? Go ahead, look at that last couple of sentences. You might notice that both drivers and riders contribute to the WSDOT income. It's almost like everyone living in the community pays for the infrastructure, (minus the jobless and maybe bikers but who cares, their wear and tear on the roads is negligible at best).

So get that dick out of your face for a second and realize that me calling bullshit on drivers getting ""Free"" infrastructure is valid. And if you want facts and figures, YOU spend the next 2 hours searching budget spreadsheets to prove me wrong. Please, _educate me_ precisely in all the ways I am incorrect.

"There's not really a way to 'source' it as a link to an article or anything. The entire claim that having more than one measure on the ballot harms them has no basis in evidence.

In campaign management classes (such as Camp Wellstone), you learn that most people vote based on values, not based on cost. Most measures are a very small amount relative to most voters' discretionary spending, and with a measure like property tax, most voters don't even pay it, so it's an indirect cost that factors into very very few voters' decision.

What you find impacts voting more than anything else is who turns out. Younger people vote for new services and aren't tax-averse, but vote only when advertised to heavily. Older people always vote, and are highly conservative. This has *far more impact than any other measure* - Sound Transit is a good example, as they failed in 2007 and then passed dramatically in 2008. That wasn't because people changed their minds - there were more 'no' votes in 2008 than in 2007 - it's because turnout was double with a billion dollars spent on advertising for the presidential campaign.

2008 is a great example, too. $18 billion for Sound Transit passed handily, along with Parks and Pike Place, two other property tax levies.

The problem isn't that one officer received one day's leave for unprofessional conduct. In the greater scheme of things, one guy who got caught doesn't really deserve to be treated much worse than his colleagues. The problem is that the SPD set up a precedent of not punishing this behavior. 

Focus on that, not on how awful this one officer is. You're going to get a lot further with the administrators who have to punish him if you stop personalizing it. 

Accept the slap on the wrist and ask what the SPD is going to do about this behavior in the future. Make it about the big picture.

"Growing up in Washington, I never confused the local tribes as being ""leathered and feathered.""  We were just kids smoking weed hanging out.  Some of my native friends had parents still into the tribal meetings, some of their parents owned smoke shops.  There was some poverty, but a big issue was the tribal money from the casinos.  That messed up a lot of families because they didn't know how to deal with the money.  

I had friends that when they were 18, they felt they were going to be in easy street for the rest of their life because they were going to receive checks from the Puyallup tribe, or whatever tribes were ranking money in from the casinos on reservations.  Some friends didn't care about going to college, some didn't even think that far, they were happy to get their tribal checks and spend it on drugs and alcohol.

Thing is, I didn't have 1000 bucks a month coming in to buy a new car I wrecked while driving drunk, or move from pot to coke as a weekly habit.

The stereotypes of the media and ignorant people are picked out of necessity.  Not many natives in Hollywood. What are they? Who are they? Ehh I dunno just sprinkle some feathers on them and let's get out of here.  Anyone who actually knows some natives understands they aren't like on tv and Sherman Alexie did more to ""factualize"" native Americans than anyone in Hollywood ever did.

I fear this article misses the point a bit, like it was written by someone in 1995 and then finally was able to say it 20 years later.  When I was a kid living in NE Tacoma 15 years ago, natives and white folks lived together, we were just regular people.  Some did drugs, some did well in school, some got checks from the big tribes, some were holding on to their roots, some didn't care, I feel like poverty and substances abuse was an issue, but I don't know if it was any worse for natives as it was for white/black/Mexican folks.  I didn't know any rich Native Americans in the area, but I knew most of nice houses in the area were owned by whites/black/Asian.",false,true,t1_chkroat,Xtulu,,0,1400384394,t5_2qhad,t3_25q5bb,t3_25q5bb,1,1433844874,0,0,chkroat,Seattle,1,,,

It has failed to hear that the plight of the negro poor has worsened over the last twelve or fifteen years. It has failed to hear that the promises of freedom and justice have not been met.

"&gt;Because hailed taxis are a great service to a lot of people.

If this is true, then they would continue to exist. If it turns out they're not that convenient for a ""lot"" of people, then they might go ahead. Actually having some competitive pressure from TNCs might actually force them to clean up their act and improve service.

&gt;Not everyone has a smart phone or the capability to call up for a ride when they might need one. There is a great trend to marginalize the poor and working class in Seattle and this is but another step.

Most people can make a phone call, or ask someone to make a phone call (if they're out away from home, for example). I doubt hailed taxis serve the poor more than other forms of tranport, especially since the hail-able taxis tend to mostly service the neighborhoods which are the most expensive to live in.

"&gt; abundance of SFH within the city limits is what makes Seattle special

It also makes Seattle mind-bendingly expensive.  San Francisco is vast-majority SFH as well...

&gt; permanently changing the make up of neighborhoods

That's the current refrain of the NIMBYs, ""you're changing the character of our neighborhood.""  The problem is twofold: First, ""the neighborhood"" is always changing.  Second, it means that people who got here first get to dictate land use policies for all time so that new people who don't have huge sacks of cash can never move in.

&gt; apartment buildings should be in commercial districts

Why don't people who can't afford or don't want a SFH get to live in residential areas?  Also, what is a commercial area?  For example, my lot is zoned LR2 (light residential), which means apartments or townhouses and is surrounded by SFH.

&gt; areas like the newly developed SLU seem perfect for tall buildings

But, what's a tall building?  People build 6-story buildings--which is allowed by the zoning--in Cap Hill along commercial arterials and folks lose their minds.  Also, do you see a difference between 6-story and 30-story buildings if both contain apartments or condos (I'm not being sarcastic, I'm genuinely curious because some people do and some don't).

&gt; I should point out that I don't think I'm 100% right about this. I'm just kind of shooting from the hip here.

And that's fine; I am, too.  No one answer is perfect.  The thing is, we have to do (and will wind up doing, whether we like it or not) one of three things: Build more housing (including in-fill* in SFH areas because there is virtually no vacant, buildable land left in Seattle); price anybody who can't afford to put $400,000 at a minimum into a house out of the city; engineer a collapse of Detroit without the subsequent renewal.

They listen to us when we send e-mails about the bad data and it does get worked on.

Here's the key: if you have a bad experience with OneBusAway's data (or the app on iOS, but not any other platform since those are written by third parties), contact Sound Transit and tell them.  They do want to know and the only way **to** know is to actually hear about it.  If you e-mail onebusaway@soundtransit.org, it really goes to someone who looks at the back-end data.

"I think we're talking about two different things. I'm arguing against the assertion that people taking public transport IN the city helps outlying area commuters much, not that public transportation TO/FROM outlying areas helps commuters (re: your statement about ""one less person taking I-5 from MLK/Airport Way to Seneca). That I agree with in principle, although it isn't working great in practice if you take the bus from outlying areas, at least on some routes.




Most of the traffic problems on outlying areas are not because of back-ups in the city proper, they're because of accidents, bad weather, or other incidents that happen on the freeways outside the city. The streets of Seattle could be full of nothing but bikers and you'd still have gridlock a few miles out. 




(To be clear, I'm not against making it easier to bike or ride buses in the city - I think that's great - it just doesn't help outlying commuters that much.)




FYI Perhaps you didn't mean it this way, but it's disrespectful to call a commuter from Enumclaw a ""dipstick"" when a job in Seattle may be the only one they can get, they can't afford to move, and the public transportation options from there to Seattle aren't great.

"&gt;Ban on semi-automatic rifles and shotguns.

Unconstitutional based on United States v. Miller. The Miller decision upheld the 1934 National Firearms Act because the court ruled that the 2nd amendment applied to protect firearms relevant for current military use. The 1994 AWB only stood because it was a ban primarily on arbitrary cosmetic features on firearms.

&gt;Ban on handguns except for occupations (e.g. security guard, target shooter) that require them.

Unconstitutional based on United States v. Miller, District of Columbia v. Heller, applied to the states by McDonald v. City of Chicago.

&gt;Government buyback of all existing firearms that become illegal under the new law.

Such laws are not constitutional and would not stand up to judicial review.

&gt;The US has the 13th highest death by gun rate in the world and more than 3x the next highest western country. As a resident of the United States I am stakeholder.

You do not reside in all 50 states simultaneously and experience all firearms related crime in this country. Your exposure to the potential of firearms violence is localized, i.e the state of Washington. Our violent crime rate is significantly lower than the national average, so is our firearms violence rate. 

You cite death by firearm, not homicide by firearm. 2/3's of firearms related deaths are suicides. We have approximately 100 firearms related homicides per year in Washington. Then you have to eliminate homicides of gang members by firearm. Then eliminate homicides that were legally justified self-defense.

"Yes, you will have higher rents, but you can stabilize rate growth. Seattle is not experiencing some sort of unprecedented rate level compared to the rest of the nation, it is just getting to a point that is more in line with other large cities.

The problem is that if you do NOT have a decent transport system then rates will continue to spike in a centralized pattern and you'll have clear stratification of income levels, which causes social disparity as services move towards the areas with higher incomes and away from the areas now that are almost all lesser incomes.

What we need is good dedicated rail transport that can create mini-urban cores based around transit hubs like we see in Japan. This spreads out urban levels of density and services, and pulls out and expands these pockets of higher rates, and letting lower income areas have the same levels of access to transportation and services.

Leaving everything centered around a downtown core creates a ""walled"" effect, and that is what good mass transit prevents (as well as good city planning, something most American cities lack).",false,true,t1_cf9im4x,NouberNou,Capitol Hill,0,1391794993,t5_2qhad,t3_1x790w,t1_cf9ic44,1,1432296758,0,0,cf9im4x,Seattle,1,,flair,

In general retail pays a lot less than some other industries so you have to compare apples to apples here.  The simple fact is that warehouse workers aren't especially skilled labor and can be easily replaced, therefore they don't make much.  That's life and Amazon in not exactly unique in having the opinion you pay what you need to.

"Just fyi, I have become convinced that what I would consider the ""slow fade"" in other places actually IS the Seattle version of friendship. 

They text once for every three you send. They cancel plans or refuse to make plans in the first place. They say things like ""I might be able to make it but I have some other things going on that weekend."" 

Anywhere else, these would all be serious indicators that the people can barely tolerate my presence. In this city, every single person who said or did anything along those lines still tries to hang out every eight months or so. Some of them have even waited a year and then called out of the blue acting like we're good buddies. 

At first I was really wierded out. I remember seeing a woman at a party who said, ""Oh I have some names to help you in your job search."" And I was like, ""I've been at my current job for five months. I don't even remember asking you for help."" I was really offended at the time. Like, ""Did she not want to help me and so she avoided me for more than six months hoping she wouldn't have to?"" 

But I don't think that was it. I think people here quite literally think it's normal to see someone once every few months. And that's a friendship. 

I haven't hung out with anyone I invited to my wedding in the last month. A couple of them I actually invited just to see if they would reply, because I was curious to see what the hell is up with them and they never return emails or texts. I don't even care if they show up. I just thought it would be funny to see if they would respond.

"A stadium is good for a city!

&gt;A review of the empirical literature assessing the effects of subsidies for professional sports franchises and facilities reveals that most evidence goes against sports subsidies. Specifically, subsidies cannot be justified on the grounds of local economic development, income growth or job creation. A survey of economists also reveals a general opposition toward sports subsidies.(1)

But it's a entertainment destination!

&gt;Economic growth takes place when a community's resources—people, capital investments, and natural resources like land—become more productive. Increased productivity can arise in two ways: from economically beneficial specialization by the community for the purpose of trading with other regions or from local value added that is higher than other uses of local workers, land, and investments. Building a stadium is good for the local economy only if a stadium is the most productive way to make capital investments and use its workers.(2)

But it generates money for the local economy!

&gt;Sports facilities attract neither tourists nor new industry. ~~Probably the most successful export facility is Oriole Park, where about a third of the crowd at every game comes from outside the Baltimore area. (Baltimore's baseball exports are enhanced because it is 40 miles from the nation's capital, which has no major league baseball team.) Even so, the net gain to Baltimore's economy in terms of new jobs and incremental tax revenues is only about $3 million a year—not much of a return on a $200 million investment.~~(2) (EDIT: ""just a point of order about Baltimore.... the study you reference cites D.C. not having a baseball team, which is no longer the case. Baltimore is no longer an export facility for baseball"" -Thank you u/PNWQuakesFan)

also

&gt;Another criticism of stadium subsidies is that much of the money the new stadiums bring in does not stay in the local economy. Instead of going to stadium employees and other sources that would benefit the local community, a lot of the money goes toward paying the players. The problem is that most of these players do not live in the local community, so the money they make is taken away and spent in other locations. Critics question why a city should subsidize a sports stadium when large portions of the revenue the stadium receives will not be reinvested in the city. They go on to claim that subsidizing job training or improved transportation are smarter investments to make, as they will yield higher returns for the city.(1)


If you're not already convinced this is a big scam on the taxpayer, this is my favorite evidence of swindling:

&gt;...the monopolistic structure of sports. Leagues maximize their members' profits by keeping the number of franchises below the number of cities that could support a team. To attract teams, cities must compete through a bidding war, whereby each bids its willingness to pay to have a team, not the amount necessary to make a team viable.(2)

&gt;Cities go to great lengths to lure a new team to town or to keep the home team home. They feel compelled to compete with other cities that offer new or updated facilities; otherwise, the home team might make good on its threat to leave. The weight of economic evidence, however, shows that taxpayers spend a lot of money and ultimately don't get much back. (1)

1: [wiki source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stadium_subsidy#Criticisms)

2: [Brookings source](http://www.brookings.edu/research/articles/1997/06/summer-taxes-noll) (Old article, but still relevant economic conclusions)

It's always bothered me that we have to pay to watch them play on the private playground that we paid for, but aren't allowed to use ourselves. I'm not even really a sport fan, so if they're not bringing money into the city, what's my return on tax investment besides bad traffic? 
I'm not hating on you, or sports. People like them, it brings them enjoyment, and you can't put an price tag on a good time. And I still think going to a game is exciting, a lot of which has to do with the whole stadium experience. So don't get me wrong, I'm not advocating against stadium building or sports. But it's some serious bullshit that the taxpayer ends up footing the bill under the promise of economic growth.

"If this is what you think, then you don't really understand the problems people have with Yelp.

It's possible, but I've never seen anyone here suggest it seriously or complain about it happening.

So what this means is that you can't necessarily trust a business with lots of good reviews- they could just be having all the bad ones filtered.
